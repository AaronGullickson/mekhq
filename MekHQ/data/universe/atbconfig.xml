			comes from information in the FM:Mercs(R), its supplementals,
			and FM 3085. Dates are mostly approximate due to lack of precise detail
			in the source material.
			*Note that start and end dates are optional, but must
			follow yyyy-MM-dd format. Planet names much match the
			name in planets.xml exactly.-->
