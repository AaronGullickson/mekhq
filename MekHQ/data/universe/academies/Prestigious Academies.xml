        <description>Founded in 2414 by Hered Selaj, the Aitutaki Military Academy has been a center of anti-Marik sentiment. Initially exclusive to Regulan students, enrollment policies broadened under Thomas Marik's reign due to LCCC directives. The school's atmosphere includes strict traditions and practices, such as challenging trials by combat among cadets, which have been scrutinized by the LCCC. Graduates, mainly MechWarriors, often retain pro-Regulus sentiments, despite LCCC's efforts to diversify assignments.</description>
