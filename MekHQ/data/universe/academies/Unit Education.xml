        <description>An apprenticeship is a hands-on training program where young recruits learn from experienced personnel. Apprentices start with basic skills, and gradually take on more responsibilities. This mentorship-based training emphasizes practical experience, but lacks any formal qualifications. Furthermore, apprenticing to an active military unit has its dangers.</description>
