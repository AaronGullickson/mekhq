    desc: "The Niops Association was originally a self sufficient research facility
      designed by the Star League to maintain a multi-century study of the system's
      dying star. As part of the self suficiency Niops required facilities for entire
      families, as well as an ability to produce their own goods and food. They were
      so self sufficient that during the Amaris Coup, Niops was forgotten by the Star
      League, even as the continued to send reports.\n\nIn the 2800s Capellan refugees
      fleeing the early Succession Wars landed on Niops and filled the scientists
      in on what was going on in the Inner Sphere. Niops decided the safest course
      was to cut off any remaining contact with the rest of the Inner Sphere and continued
      with their research. The refugees became a source of unskilled labor to take
      over menial jobs. Eventually the Association was formed from the bond between
      the ruling scientists and the unskilled laborers. The original scientific outpost
      was located on Niops VII but Niops V and VI were colonized when additional farmland
      was needed to feed the expanded population.\n\nNiops VII is a cold planet with
      access to sufficient resources to keep the Association's original settlement
      supplied. However, the addition of refugees from the Inner Sphere resulted in
      the settlement of other planets in the system.\n\nNiops V and VI were settled
      primarily to expand the available resources to the Niops Association when it
      became difficult for Niops VII to supply all the inhabitants. Niops V and VI
      are primarily sites for agriculture and mineral extraction. Niops VI is slightly
      warmer than Niops VII (25C equatorial temperature) and Niops V is warmer still
      (30C equatorial temperature).\n\t\t"
