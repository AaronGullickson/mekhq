    desc: 3135 - Shinonoi is a world of fertile lands; a long, mild growing season;
      and abundant native livestock. Two of the planet‘s four major landmasses, Matsuda
      and Kokuya, were devoted almost exclusively to farming and ranching communities
      when the planet was first settled. Jukemwa, almost covered in snow and ice,
      lay completely within Shinonoi‘s north polar zone, and early surveys deemed
      it virtually uninhabitable. Nonetheless, a few hardy souls established towns
      on islands off Jukemwa, which today are among the planet‘s most successful fishing
      communities. Narosi, the smaller, equatorial continent where geologists discovered
      an abundance of mineral deposits and metal ores, became the heart of Shinonoi‘s
      mining and manufacturing industries and home to several sprawling metroplexes
      and factories, including the capital city of Marimasu. Shinonoi‘s agriculture
      and industry helped the planet prosper throughout the Succession Wars despite
      numerous House Davion raids, but these raids were nothing compared with the
      disaster that befell Shinonoi in 3075, when a rogue eight-kilometer-wide asteroid,
      designated simply as SH01378-A, struck the continent of Narosi. The strike instantly
      annihilated three of Shinonoi‘s largest industrial cities and set the entire
      continent of Narosi ablaze. The impact and the resulting fires sent enough particulate
      matter into Shinonoi‘s atmosphere to drop planetwide temperatures by more than
      five degrees, wiping out crops and crippling the agricultural industries on
      Matsuda and Kokuya for almost a decade. The impact also set off a series of
      dormant fault lines around the world, extending the damage to communities on
      Matsuda and Kokuya. Despite the demands of the ongoing efforts to counter the
      Blakist Jihad, relief organizations from the Combine and its allies poured badly
      needed money, medical aid and equipment into Shinonoi‘s recovery. Devlin Stone
      himself sponsored a program to assist the ravaged planet and restore order after
      the capital city was destroyed, and when his newborn Republic of the Sphere
      expanded to include Shinonoi, many were relocated to this world to reclaim what
      had been lost in the disaster. The difficult relief and restoration efforts
      have borne fruit. Today, Shinonoi is once again a viable agro-world, and the
      fishing communities of Jukemwa have begun to record their first profits since
      the Narosi Strike. The continent of Narosi itself, however, is still a blasted
      wasteland, dotted with the scorched remains of cities, though a few new towns
      have been established there. The new capital of the planet, Rising Sun, is located
      on Matsuda and hosts the planet‘s largest spaceport. The nearby city of Kaffeli
      houses the bulk of the planetary defense force.
