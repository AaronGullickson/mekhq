      Annapolis was once like New Avalon and El Dorado, a fantastic world with plentiful fresh water, a Terran-compatible ecology, fresh air and excellent mineral resources. Discovered in 2218 and opened for colonization in 2235 to great fanfare, Annapolis was settled by the elite of the Terran Alliance (reflected in its name, drawn from a small town near one of the Alliance's centers of power). The Alliance planned the world as a showcase regional capital to solve crippling communication and control delays to Alliance colonies. Accordingly, Annapolis received massive funding and heavy immigration from Terra.

      After that bright dawn, Annapolis ran into tough times (the entire second half of the 23rd century) that set the stage for its present-day situation: a lush, overpopulated (for its technology level) backwater where few of its occupants see beyond the borders of their cornfields. Trouble began after Terran crops (colonial gene-mods broadly resistant to alien pests and microbes) had brutally winnowed certain local microbes into resistant strains that found terrestrial life a perfect environment. Just as these new superbugs were causing everything from deadly plagues to unsightly skin rashes among colonists faster than overwhelmed medical clinics could cure, the Terran Alliance issued the 2242 Demarcation Declaration and abandoned Annapolis. When the Expansionist Party swept back into power on Terra, they sent ships to rescue Alliance government personnel, but considered the rest of the world a write-off. Loss of much-needed government support prompted technological and economic collapse. The subsequent Exodus from Terra bypassed the (literally) plagued colony, depriving it of fresh blood that might have revived its fortunes.

      Today, Annapolis resembles a Davion Outback world or one of the many independent Periphery planets, despite being a rare garden world. Most of the population lives off subsistence farming of rice paddies and cornfields, and the Kurita nobles who rule the planet do what they can to keep permanent this aesthetic ideal of "pastoral peasantry." In reality, life is brutish and dirty, the planet’s current state is all the more tragic because Annapolis remains a water and mineral-rich world, though centuries of industrialized mining reduced its stocks of rare, valuable materials such as germanium. Local peasants are well-fed on average, and Annapolis needs roughly two billion more people before it might face a Malthusian-style collapse at its current crude level of technology (roughly equivalent to Terra's early to mid-19th century, with a dearth of combustion power). Population pressures and the relatively disadvantaged shugo noble rank will likely force industrialization over the next few generations.

      The coastal capital city of Maryland is, to Combine visitors, the jewel of the planet. The city holds to a strict Japanese aesthetic for even its modern buildings while keeping a simple, clean layout. It includes a walled section for the planet's elite. Rather than a serious fortification, the wall is a traffic-control measure that keeps country bumpkins from streaming into Annapolis' single significant high-tech center. The Walled Sector houses Annapolis' university, which provides an excellent education to the planet's higher nobles; hosts stores, clinics and clubs with off-world imported goods; and contains the sole municipal fusion power plant, as well as ComStar's HPG. It also features off-world-supported repair facilities for advanced technology.

      Beyond Maryland, technology is scarce. The most advanced industrial regions have factories approximating the early 20th century's capabilities, often depending on hydropower or renewable biofuels. These produce the trickle of domestically built motorized vehicles used on the planet, the trains, steamships, and odd tractor or bus. Other technology is usually rare and imported. A typical Annapolis village prides itself on having a solar panel powering a few items like a Star League-era x-ray/convection oven and robotic toy; a fief is proud to host a theater with a century-old tri-vid projector and several holovids to display. Instead of horse couriers that a visitor might expect, a copper wire telephone network reaches to most villages, giving village elders (and paying customers) a means of communicating with central authorities or business associates. Tozama daimyos (and some shugos) have telephones and tri-vids in their homes (and wealthy tozama daimyos may have wireless communicators). Communication services, other than HPG, are provided not by ComStar, but by a local Arakaki-owned company with ties to the Combine firm Tanadi.

      A few Stone Age tribes exist in the planet's deep deserts and jungles, far from the reach of the government and dominant culture. These peoples are some of the most primitive and quixotic groups in the Inner Sphere. For example, deep in the cloud forests of Queen Anne's Land dwells a cargo cult that worships amazingly accurate mockups of Star League-era DropShips. They tend to follow the usual course of cargo cults, prophesying that their great benefactors from the stars, with magical powers and great gifts, will one day return if they maintain their mockups. One of these tribes maintains a six-meter tall, perfect likeness of Aleksandr Kerensky, carved of a type of granite isotopically confirmed to be from a completely different star system than Annapolis.
