      3028 - Wapakoneta is a planet almost entirely covered in water and is famous for its many small picturesque islands and resorts. The largest and warmest continent is New Wisconsin which is home to the planetary capital and most of Wapakoneta’s population. New Wisconsin is near the equator and much of its varied landmass is covered in thick forests. The smallest continent, Little Florida, is located far to the north and is almost entirely covered in glaciers and it is home to only one permanent settlement, the port city of Tassel. The remaining three continents are largely uninhabited due to the monstrous typhoons that regularly tear across them.

      Aside from the five continents, the planet is dotted with thousands of islands that range in size from a few square meters to a few thousand square kilometers. Palm Island is an example of one of the larger islands and is owned by the Palm family, who have been the rulers of Wapakoneta for over 200 years, in the name of house Davion.

      The biggest military base on Wapakoneta is located on Stygian Shoals, an island forty kilometers south of Little Florida Island. Stygian Shoals is roughly 960 square kilometers and holds sufficient housing for troops moving along the Combine-Federated Suns border. The island is also home to one of the Federated Suns’ top marine schools, Camp Getty.

      The primary export from Wapakoneta comes from the vast oceans that cover the planet. New Wisconsin’s northern coast is dotted by food processing plants that specialize in processing and freezing fish and other sea life for transport to neighboring planets, with the planet’s flash-frozen swordfin being prized by high-class restaurants on surrounding worlds. The other large industry on Wapakoneta is tourism, with dozens of vacation and resort locations across the multitude of islands. Unfortunately the tourism tends to fade when tensions are high between the Combine and Federated Suns.
