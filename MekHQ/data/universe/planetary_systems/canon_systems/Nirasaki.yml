    desc: Nirasaki was settled by communal idealists who hoped to create a perfect
      society, in which everyone would live in harmony in the virtual absence of government
      or a policing force. The experiment was only partially successful, as infighting
      between settlers and the early colonists' insistence on barter-based trade made
      it difficult to deal with other worlds for needed goods. Eventually, a basic
      planetary government, structured as a loose coalition of the various communes
      on Kalifax and Ouanii, Nirasaki‘s two largest continents, was established. Based
      on democratic principles, the Nirasaki government required a simple majority
      vote for any decisions affecting a planetary region or interplanetary relations
      and helped create a basic planetary economy based on work credits and a standard
      for determining the relative values of products and services. Beyond these basic
      functions, which included an emergency powers clause in case of an external
      threat, the Nirasaki government had no other authority. Farms, cattle ranches,
      fishing communities and artistic communes made up the bulk of Nirasaki‘s population
      until the rise of the Star League. Though Nirasaki was left to its semi-anarchistic
      government under the Hegemony, the planet began to draw the attention of entrepreneurs.
      However, few corporate entities could make headway on Nirasaki, due to lax government
      practices and the work credits system, until the native Nirasaki Computers Collective
      was founded in the large Blue Heron Commune. The NCC developed computer systems
      of astonishing efficiency and quality, including the famous Blue Lotus personal
      computer line, which was cutting edge in the Star League's day. For this reason,
      the Hegemony contracted the NCC to develop software for use in the Space Defense
      Systems throughout its holdings. As it happened, the NCC did its job too well
      in this regard. When the Amaris coup took place, the brightest minds of the
      Collective were forcibly relocated to Terra, and their work pitted the liberating
      SLDF forces against SDS networks that used some of the most sophisticated pseudo-artificial
      intelligence ever produced. It wasn‘t until years later, when returning SLDF
      forces uncovered technical specs hidden away for their benefit in the abandoned
      NCC headquarters, that their artful programming was defeated and the worlds
      Amaris had turned into deadly gauntlets were retaken. Though the NCC itself
      never revived after the fall of the League, its former offices and production
      facilities were eventually taken over by Blue Heron Computers, today a major
      producer of the Blue Lotus portable compads and noteputers used throughout the
      Inner Sphere. Nirasaki's government is more utilitarian now, a result of centuries
      under the Dragon‘s rule. It includes a planetary police force and a local militia,
      both based in the capital city of Elusian on the Kalifax continent. The Blue
      Heron Commune, one of the many cities that still hold to the traditions of communal
      existence, is located on the southern peninsula of Ouanii. Nirasaki‘s third
      major landmass, Arkatis, is in the planet‘s south polar region and is home to
      the Nirasaki Communications Community, a planetwide information and entertainment
      company based in the city of Arkatis' Unity.
