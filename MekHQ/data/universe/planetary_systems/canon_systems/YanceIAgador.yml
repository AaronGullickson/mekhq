    desc: The colonists who settled Yance I—dubbed Agador by its inhabitants—were
      anti-technologists, mostly of Amish descent, who sought to create a world free
      of the ravages of widespread industrialization and commercialization. Putting
      aside their beliefs long enough to plan, finance and undertake a relocation
      from one world to another, these settlers came to Yance I, assured that they
      would find a new land to their liking. Yance I was a terrestrial world of diverse
      climates, with open, hilly bands of fertile soils in the temperate zones, a
      mix of jungles and deserts in the equatorial zones, and frozen tundra and glaciers
      in the polar reaches. However, what went unnoticed in the first planetary surveys
      was the dominant animal life form. No sooner had the settlers made planetfall
      and founded their first colonies than their imported livestock—and even a few
      of the colonists—began to succumb to attacks by a predator called the black
      reaper. This aggressive, feline-like mammal, similar in many ways to the Terran
      puma, but almost half again as large and with a large, spiked, prehensile tail,
      roamed the plains of the primary continent of Paradiesland. The settlers at
      first tried to wall in their lands to keep out the reapers, but the powerful
      beasts broke through or leapt over their wooden constructs, causing massive
      damage. Relocation also failed to work, as the reapers, attracted to the new
      food source, simply followed them. In desperation, the mostly pacifistic colonists
      resorted to primitive firearms, only to find the reapers‘ hides resistant to
      such weapons. The colonists were forced to turn to modern technology to control
      the animals, bargaining with traders from nearby worlds for heavier weapons,
      including automatic rifles and laser weapons. These concessions to advanced
      technology saved the colonists but eventually eroded the pilgrims‘ way of life.
      Over the following centuries, Yance I‘s population gradually became more modernized,
      a transition that caused no small degree of conflict between the orthodox and
      progressive populations and led to the relocation of the traditionalist settlers
      to the neighboring continent of Neuhoffen. The ascendance of the Terran Hegemony
      and its incorporation of Yance I led to the further industrialization of Paradiesland,
      including the establishment of a small arms factory for SLDF infantry weapons.
      Meanwhile, Neuhoffen became a haven for those seeking escape from the evils
      of modern life, virtually left alone while the rest of the world entered the
      Golden Age of technology. The years under Combine rule saw even more turmoil
      for Neuhoffen residents, forced into increasingly smaller enclaves by the Kuritan
      rulers, who saw a better use for the minerals in the mountains of the continent.
      By the time Yance I came under the Republic‘s sway, the combination of industrialization,
      continuous Combine socioeconomic pressure, raids by nearby Houses and the Republic‘s
      resettlement directives had virtually destroyed the culture of the original
      settlers. Today, the orthodox Amish and Mennonite communities that remain on
      Neuhoffen have become little more than tourist attractions, a nostalgic look
      back at where humanity once was. The capital city of Yance I is Firstpoint,
      located on the western coast of Paradiesland. Endstehen, the largest of the
      remaining old world settlements on Neuhoffen, is set on that continent‘s southern
      reaches. Yance I‘s other three continents—Alameda in the northern hemisphere
      and Brisbane and Ausdaner in the south—make up the rest of the planet‘s landmass.
      Of these, only Ausdaner, completely covered by the planet‘s southern ice cap,
      is uninhabited.
