      Travelers visiting Eltanin are cautioned to take the recommended series of antibiotics and inoculations before visiting the surface, due to a persistent virus that wiped out all native animal life and has ravaged off-worlders since the first colonists set foot on this arid world almost a thousand years ago. The airborne virus, known locally as Eltanin Brain Fever, attacks the central nervous system and has symptoms ranging from a loss of fine motor control to seizures and blindness, eventually leading to death. Scientists tracked the source of the virus to the local wildlife, which was dying off even as the first settlers came to this world. Preventative treatments suitable for humans and most terrestrial animals were eventually found, but only after all remaining indigenous fauna had perished.

      The virus, however, may be the least of this minor industrial world‘s worries, as local scientists have determined that Eltanin‘s sun has begun to show all the signs of a star nearing the end of its stable life cycle. Spectrographic analysis and the observation of increased solar flare activity—activity that has already been blamed for Eltanin‘s increasingly unpredictable climate changes over the past several centuries—have indicated that, in perhaps as little as 8,000 years, the star may nova. Though this is no cause for alarm at the moment, the inhabitants of Eltanin have made it a point to maintain an excellent planetwide disaster response system that is also tied into its extensive global network of spaceports. Planetary emergency and relief crews are trained in scenarios ranging from flash woodland fires and meteor strikes to a worldwide evacuation order. Long before such measures should prove necessary, however, the people and industrial concerns on Eltanin remain determined to make the best of this world‘s easily reached mineral, petrochemical, and agricultural wealth.

      The capital city of Eltanin, Dry Springs, is the administrative and trading center of the planet, as well as one of thirty transportation hubs on the northern polar Platonesia supercontinent where it is situated. Eltanin‘s second largest city, Burmah, located on the southern supercontinent of Anterratica, is home to the headquarters of Eltanin Interplanetary, a local transport consortium that controls a majority of the planet‘s fifty-nine spaceports (the extreme number to be used in the event of a planetary evacuation, though most of them are mothballed, but ready to use within hours), and employs a fleet of small and medium-sized DropShips and shuttlecraft. EI also provides day-to-day transport services for Eltanin‘s many large islands in the tropical and equatorial regions between the two giant land masses, complementing the planet‘s seagoing traffic.
