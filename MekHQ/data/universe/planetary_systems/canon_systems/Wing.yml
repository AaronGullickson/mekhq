    desc: The high temperatures and high atmospheric pressures at sea level prompted
      many of the early settlers who came to Wing to establish their cities and colonies
      on the planet‘s rocky mountains and high plateaus. Many of these colonists also
      found these locales somewhat easier for maintaining steady communications with
      the mining outposts built on all four of the world‘s moons, all of which are
      heavily laced with valuable ores, including titanium, bauxite, and even germanium.
      It was the moons of Wing that truly drew the crowds to this world, rather than
      the inhabitability of the planet below, but the discovery of a world capable
      of supporting life was seen as a definite plus to the corporations that funded
      the first expeditions here. This resource-rich system was quickly incorporated
      into the Free Worlds League before the expanding Federation of Skye could stake
      a claim here, but with the rise of the Terran Hegemony and the Free Worlds‘
      admission into the original Star League, this world became a joint holding between
      Houses Marik and Cameron. Wing‘s industry made it a border trading post and
      relay station for Hegemony and Free Worlds traffic alike. After the fall of
      the Star League, Wing reverted to complete Free Worlds authority, only to be
      captured by House Steiner‘s Lyran Commonwealth during an early offensive. The
      Free Worlds League reclaimed Wing in 2917, but in the centuries of the Succession
      Wars, constant raids and the changing of hands eventually took their toll on
      this planet. By the mid-thirty-first century, over half the planet‘s Star League-era
      settlements and mining outposts on all four moons were lost forever, decimating
      the planetary economy and seriously impairing off-world trade. The worst, however,
      came during the Jihad, when renegade Marik troops, duped by the Word of Blake,
      launched an ill-fated assault on the Lyran Alliance‘s Skye region. The assaults
      and counter assaults that followed slammed through Wing and over several other
      border worlds, devastating military and civilian targets alike. Although the
      world was returned to Free Worlds authority—more accurately, the authority of
      the Marik-Stewart Commonwealth—it was so ravaged by the fighting during the
      Jihad that the planet was willingly ceded, along with several others, to Devlin
      Stone‘s Republic of the Sphere. Under Republic control, much has been done for
      the world‘s recovery, with several relocated mining conglomerates eagerly investing
      in the restoration of facilities on the moons of Wing. The recovery has also
      added a surge of new residents and citizens who have rebuilt and expanded several
      of the planet‘s more prominent cities. A new movement to exploit the resources
      of Wing itself is also underway, thanks to the recent discovery of crude oil
      deposits in some of the lowland regions on the northern Glyph continent. The
      planetary capital of Wing, Crow‘s Nest, is located on the southern continent
      of Sharr. Crow‘s Nest also includes a large spaceport, but not the planet‘s
      largest one. That honor goes to Port Wyvern, the massive DropShip landing and
      servicing complex on the south polar continent of Greinwald, around which the
      city of Wyvern has grown.
