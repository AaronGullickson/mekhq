      3135 - High-grade silicon and other minerals valuable to the electronics industry made the dim, cool world of Nusakan a natural center for the computer and electronics trades, despite its low water supply and the inhospitality of its northern and southern tundra. By the time of the Star League, this planet—jointly administered by the Lyran Commonwealth and the Terran Hegemony—was a heavily industrialized world, with such major corporations as Interstellar Business Computers and Pottor Light Computers claiming headquarters in the heart of its sprawling cities. Three Castles Brian were erected on the surface, along with twice as many military bases and spaceports, to secure these important assets against any aggressor.

      Unfortunately, the SLDF troops stationed on Nusakan during the Amaris Crisis did not reckon on an attack from within, though they fought hard and long, denying the Usurper‘s troops an easy victory. Two of the major fortifications, at Holden City and the planetary capital of Jobs City, both on the northern Katamoros continent, were destroyed after weeks of underground fighting that shook the nearby cities and towns. The third, however, at Fort Romas, held out for almost a year, becoming a rally point for the surviving SLDF troops as fighting spread across the planet. Though gallant, this resistance ultimately forced Amaris‘s troops to resort to nuclear assaults to secure Nusakan, destroying not only Fort Romas, but also a large number of the planet‘s more heavily populated cities and industriplexes. In the Liberation, Nusakan was again pummeled as returning SLDF forces faced a pitched battle in orbit and on the ground. Two WarShips, the SLS Havana and the SLS Dularam, lie in ruin where they crashed on the northern continent, shot down by the planetary defense systems during the fighting.

      By the time of the Star League‘s collapse, only twenty thousand or so people still lived on this battle-scarred planet, but since that time—and despite the predations of the Succession Wars—people and businesses have gradually returned to Nusakan. Cities have grown near both shipwrecks, named in honor of each one, and the city of Havana, in fact, is the present-day capital of this recovering world. Fortunately for Nusakan, the Word of Blake found other targets more pressing during the Jihad so they never came to cause further damage, and the planet was largely overlooked during the fighting.

      Today, Nusakan is home to a thriving population and reborn computer and electronics industries. Lenzo Computing Industries, one of the biggest computer manufacturers to develop in the post-Jihad era, has headquarters in Dularam City. Though widely known as a major producer of personal computers, LCI is currently in the middle of a massive diversification that could transform it into one of the biggest manufacturing corporations in the Inner Sphere, and it has already added military-grade electronics, including BattleMech and DropShip sensor gear, to its impressive list of quality products.
