    desc: 3130 - A warm world, with an oppressive atmosphere and active volcanoes
      in all four of its great island chains, Athenry resembles prehistoric Terra
      in many ways. Tropical foliage and steep, rocky mountains dominate most of the
      four island chains that make up the planet‘s landmass. Too close to its sun
      for polar ice caps to form, the planet‘s most habitable regions for the early
      Terran colonists were the highlands of the large islands in the northern and
      southern latitudes, where the air is thinner and the heat more bearable. Frequent
      rains keep the lowlands of Athenry lush, giving rise to exotic flora and thousands
      of interesting animal species. Many of the planet‘s native life forms, scientists
      learned, held great medicinal potential, leading to the founding of the Athenry
      Institute of Medicine on the primary northern island of Golas, in the Larsen
      Chain. The AIM was destroyed by a tactical nuke during the First Succession
      War, however, leaving only a radioactive hulk where the facilities once stood.
      In recent years, after the Blakist Jihad and the influx of new inhabitants from
      Devlin Stone‘s relocation plan, ancient ruins were uncovered in the thick jungles
      of the southern Zubeckis Chain, particularly on the secondary island of Vasquez.
      Studies of these ruins revealed that they are the remains of colonies established
      almost a full century before the first settlers were thought to have made planetfall
      on Athenry. Though no one knows what fate befell these colonists, the so-called
      Zubeckis ruins, which exhibit architectural styles and techniques common to
      Southeast Asian cultures of the 22nd century, have become a tourist attraction
      and an archaeological curiosity, drawing millions of visitors each year. The
      apparent capital of these ruined colonies has been dubbed ―City of the Lost,
      and parts of the site were recently opened to the public. Athenry‘s capital
      city of New Senna is perched in the rocky mountains of Lisbon, the primary mass
      of the southern polar Espalar Chain. Though cities dot much of the Espalar,
      Zubeckis and Larsen Chains, only a few towns have been established on the mostly
      equatorial Wandessa Chain, largely due to the extreme temperatures and humidity
      of that region. Largest among these settlements is the seaport city of Ricobar,
      which serves as a port of call for the planet‘s ocean-going trade.
