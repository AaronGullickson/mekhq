      3060: Matsu is a relatively comfortable planet with a similar gravity, atmosphere and climate as Earth. The planet was originally settled by the Capellan Confederation during the time of the Star League to act as a regional supplier for nearby planets. Matsu is nearly a breadbasket world with abundant arable land and its small oceans are teeming with edible aquatic life. The Matsu Seabass is a particular delicacy in the region. The planet also saw great strides in improvements to its industry, including several high-tech endeavors, though the planet’s modest natural resources cannot keep up with demand and recent supply shortages resulting in the loss of the Federated Commonwealth’s government have significantly reduced outputs and hurt the planet’s economy.

      Matsu made it through the Succession Wars in good shape before being ultimately captured by House Davion in the 4th Succession War and remaining in the Federated Commonwealth until late 3057. As with much of the region, Operation Guerrero and the Lyran Alliance leaving the FedCom, left Matsu adrift. The planetary government was able to take over and keep order and keep the planet independent, however it was inefficient and bogged down by the fast changes, resulting in an inability to work with surrounding systems to work out deals to procure the supplies needed for the local factories. As a result there was a high level of unrest on the planet. Matsu was eventually re-absorbed by the Capellan Confederation in the early 3060s.

      Matsu has 30 hour days and orbits its sun every 1034 standard days. This results in summer and winter on Matsu lasting longer than a full Terran-standard year, while spring and fall are only a few months long each.
