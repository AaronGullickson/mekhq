      Rockwellawan was settled within a century of the collapse of the Star League and for most of its history was a member of the Taurian Concordat, eventually becoming part of the “New Colony Region” before joining the Fronc Reaches when the small realm became independent in 3066. Rockwellawan was colonized to take advantage of its abundance of natural resources, especially gems and precious metals, which seem to be almost inexhaustible. Despite three centuries of habitation and mining, new veins are found regularly to feed the planet’s mining economy. Luckily for the inhabitants of Rockwellawan, the planet is relatively comfortable for humans, though hot and humid and the planet has abundant arable land and has no trouble feeding its population and can even support exporting food to neighboring worlds.

      Rockwellawan has modest industry outside of mining, including Interstellar Agriculture Concerns, which primarily produces farming equipment and tractors. However, the IAC factory in the town of Kite on the Corundum continent produces the venerable Vedette Medium Tank. Kite is located right on the edge of the planet’s arctic region, which is dominated by glaciers. The factory’s switch to military production began with a rocky start, due to engine shortages and faulty transmissions and other issues that were dealt with as they arose. The planetary capital of Carat is located in the rainy mountains of the Diamond continent.
