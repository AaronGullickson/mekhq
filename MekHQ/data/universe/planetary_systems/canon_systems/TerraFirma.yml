    desc: Blessed with huge tracts of untamed forests, extensive mineral resources,
      and mountainous reaches, Terra Firma, in many ways, was considered a twin to
      the nearby Capolla. Colonized jointly with Capolla by a collection of small
      corporations and independent homesteaders, trade between both worlds led to
      a prosperous and semisymbiotic relationship even before the formation of the
      Terran Hegemony and the Star League. This relationship worked so well that both
      worlds supported a strong and diverse economic and social base without the need
      for major military industries. In a deal brokered at the twin system‘s entry
      into the Hegemony, Terra agreed to a limited autonomy for both worlds—a policy
      that every successive power after the Hegemony assumed as well. In the chaos
      that erupted following the collapse of the Federated Commonwealth, much of Terra
      Firma‘s landscape and many cities were damaged by heavy fighting. The formation
      of the Terracap Confederation with Capolla helped Terra Firma to recover, but
      aid from the Word of Blake, in exchange for the right to place military bases
      and "defensive forces" on the planet before the Jihad, truly brought the planet‘s
      ravaged infrastructure back from the brink. Pledging a continued hands-off policy
      in the tiny alliance‘s political and business affairs, and their troops to the
      defense of both worlds, the Blakists earned the support—and, in some cases,
      fear—of the Terra Firma population. Taking a more active role in the rebuilding
      of Terra Firma, the Blakists managed to insinuate their agents into the planetary
      government, undercutting the local authority and instilling in the people an
      attitude of xenophobia and paranoia. When the Jihad was launched, many of Terra
      Firma‘s citizens joined with the Word of Blake to defend their world, until
      they realized the true horrors of the Blakist terror war swirling around them.
      Aided by Devlin Stone‘s forces during the liberation, the Terra Firmans helped
      drive off the Jihad fanatics, but at terrible cost to the planet‘s remaining
      cities and industry. Today, only the Okeenog Woodlands on the primary continent
      of Rusalaia are free from the scars of war. The capital city, Freinze, home
      also to the planet‘s single spaceport, is located on Rusalaia‘s northern coast,
      a scant few kilometers from the ruins of Aserlitz, the planet‘s previous capital,
      reduced to rubble by the Jihad and now a city-scale memorial to the victims
      of war. On Reniki, the smaller, equatorial continent east of Rusalia, Ballard-Dukempic
      Foods of Keid maintains a branch office in the city of Nystoll. A recovering
      industry with a history dating back to the glory days of the Star League, the
      foodstuffs supercorporation now oversees most of the farming and ranching industries
      that are once more on the rise in Reniki‘s open plains.
