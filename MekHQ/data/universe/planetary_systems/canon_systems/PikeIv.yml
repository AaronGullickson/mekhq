    desc: High atmospheric pressure and scarce surface water made colonizing Pike
      IV a difficult prospect, but not one the early settlers were unwilling to tackle.
      The majority of this mineral-rich world‘s first cities were founded in the highlands
      of Erubis and Blight, Pike IV‘s two northern continents, where the air pressure
      was more manageable. Unfortunately, the colonists soon learned that Pike‘s frequent
      windstorms could do heavy damage at the higher altitudes unless they took precautions
      against the unpredictable weather. Paramus, a trading post and home to Pike‘s
      largest spaceport, became the first of the planet‘s major cities to be surrounded
      by a large, heavy wall to counteract the high winds. Meanwhile, the supercontinent
      of Karasia, just south of Blight and stretching all the way to the planet‘s
      southern pole, boasted fewer high-altitude regions and claimed the majority
      of the planet‘s landmass, as well as its wealth of metal ores and gemstones.
      Smaller, sparser settlements grew on Karasia as the result of stubborn efforts
      to access the bulk of Pike IV‘s wealth. Many of these were made up of low-slung
      buildings, sealed against the weather and attached to air-thinning units to
      make life in the oppressive environment bearable. However, no walls were required
      around the cities because the windstorms across Karasia were milder. An odd
      dual society arose from the division between the highlanders of Eribus and Blight
      and the lowlanders of Karasia. Symbiotic but fraught with political conflict,
      the populations of the highlands and lowlands often argued over the needs of
      their respective cities and towns. Matters came to a head during the rule of
      the Star League and the Terran Hegemony, when SLDF mediators were called in
      to settle a small brushfire war between highlanders and lowlanders. After the
      Star League‘s collapse and the ascendance of the Draconis Combine, raiders enjoyed
      mixed success trying to use the sociopolitical situation on Pike IV to their
      advantage. Depending on the political climate at any given time, resistance
      to invaders ranged from determined and coordinated to bickering and ineffective.
      During one invasion in 3012, attacking ‘Mech forces struck Paramus, meeting
      resistance from both highlander and lowlander militias. Unfortunately for the
      defenders, recent political infighting between the two factions tainted their
      command structure, leading to poor coordination that allowed the attackers to
      overwhelm the city briefly, at a cost of millions of C-bills in damage. The
      resettlement directives put in place by Devlin Stone during the creation of
      the Republic have muted the chronic infighting, but experts believe that as
      the conflicting needs of the highlanders and lowlanders become clear to Pike‘s
      new inhabitants, the old rivalries may return. Unsurprisingly, Pike IV has two
      capital cities that govern the planet. The lowlander capital, Rolfshire, is
      located on the west coast of Karasia, while the highlander capital of Stratopolis
      is located on Erubis, on a plateau three hundred kilometers northwest of Paramus.
