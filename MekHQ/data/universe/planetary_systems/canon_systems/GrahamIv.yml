    desc: 3135 - A Terra-like world with vast metal deposits, mineral wealth, and
      fossil fuel resources, Graham IV attracted the attention of several Terran manufacturing
      corporations looking to expand their facilities off-world. By the time of the
      Terran Hegemony, no fewer than six major corporations and a host of smaller
      ones had transformed the untamed wilderness of Graham IV into a sprawling series
      of heavily industrialized cities and factory complexes. Two of these corporations,
      Dekirk Aerospace and Mitchell Vehicles, were primary contractors for the SLDF,
      their products included everything from conventional vehicles and aerospace
      fighters to BattleMechs and WarShips. The Star League even placed one of its
      rare orbital flight academies over Graham IV, to take advantage of prototype
      aerospace fighter designs coming out of the Dekirk Aerospace Research and Development
      facility in Dekirk City. For these reasons, unfortunately, Amaris‘ forces were
      particularly brutal in their efforts to seize the planet, resorting to widespread
      nuclear attacks to obliterate any of the factories and cities they could not
      capture. Today, the surface of Graham IV is a post-nuclear wasteland of radioactive
      craters and demolished cities. Only a few cities are left, either because they
      were too small and remote to be worth a nuclear strike, or because they were
      built after the devastation. These cities, located far from the ruins on the
      marginally habitable continents of Barvionne and Palothica, are largely maintained
      by mining interests and small manufacturing operations that continue to exploit
      the few remaining lodes of Graham IV‘s resources which can be safely harnessed.
      The city of Keystone, on the southern reaches of Palothica, features the planet‘s
      primary spaceport, a corporate trade center for the surviving planetary companies,
      and even the garrison command for the planetary militia. A pair of large space
      habitats, placed around the planet during the years of the Free Worlds League,
      support a healthy share of the planetary population now. One of these, dubbed
      New Dekirk City, serves as the planet‘s official capital in the sky.
