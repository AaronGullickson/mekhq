    desc: Orbiting a yellow giant that is prone to all manner of solar activity, from
      massive sunspots to occasional gravitational shifts intense enough to set off
      earthquakes and volcanoes, Vindemiatrix is a world facing its own eventual extinction.
      Scientists believe the final collapse of the parent star is still several thousand
      years away, but already the effects of its death throes have been felt on this
      world. In the centuries since the first settlers came here, over fifteen percent
      of the various species in the local flora and fauna have become extinct, with
      another thirty percent formally listed as endangered due to gradual changes
      in climate and the added stress of human occupation. Though numerous initiatives
      to slow the decline of the ecosystem have been attempted through the centuries,
      none have been entirely successful. Despite this gloomy forecast, Vindemiatrix
      remains a pleasant enough world to visit and live on. Several veins of common
      metals, suitable to support a modest industrial base, are backed up by enough
      arable land to support the planet‘s population. The planet is also home to the
      Vindemiatrix Observatory, a university focused almost exclusively on the study
      of planetology and stellar phenomena. Understandably, the largest focus of study
      at the Observatory campus is that of stellar life cycles, with the planet‘s
      own star serving as a point of reference. Vindemiatrix Observatory is located
      on the outskirts of Havannask, a mining town on the northern continent of Treshiria.
      The planetary capital, Brattleston Depot, and its attendant spaceport, are located
      on the southeastern continent of Scandavara. Vindemiatrix‘s third large landmass,
      the southwestern continent of Kressia, is home to most of the planet‘s ranching
      and farming communities, thanks to its abundance of arable land, and also boasts
      the largest natural wildlife preserves for the planet‘s endangered species.
