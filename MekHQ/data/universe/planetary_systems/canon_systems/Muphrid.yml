    desc: 3135 - Muphrid, like many worlds immediately coreward and anti-spinward
      of Terra, such as Skye and Caledonia, was initially settled largely by Irish
      and Scottish colonists during the first wave of human expansion into space.
      A pleasant world of mild seasons , fertile soils, expansive seas, and thick
      vegetation on its three large temperate-zone continents, Muphrid was quickly
      established as an agricultural world. Settled only a few months after Thorin,
      the Muphrid colonial government looked to their neighbor world for a guide and
      adopted similar zoning laws to contain industrial expansion and maintain the
      natural beauty of their world. Declaring the northeasternmost continent, Shamrock,
      as the industrial “zone,” and limiting its close western neighbor, Ridgeway,
      to a mix of mineral mining and agricultural concerns, the colonists defined
      the southern continent of MacArthur as a low-technology “zone” similar to Thorin‘s
      continent of Freda. These zoning laws and their immediate effects shaped the
      way Muphrid‘s population developed their world, and even today a distinct difference
      can be seen between the cities and towns on each of the three continents. Shamrock,
      the most populous and industrialized, is also home to the planetary capital
      of New Dublin, and the large primary spaceport of Calenaton. Ridgeway, by comparison,
      has smaller towns dominated by granite- and ore-mining operations or large agricultural
      communities and ranches. Meanwhile, the virtually untamed wilderness of MacArthur
      is home to a few small farming, logging, and fishing communities, but remains
      dominated by thick jungles untouched by humankind. The few Star League Castles
      Brian placed during the reign of the Terran Hegemony were destroyed during the
      Amaris crisis or soon after the fall of the League, but thankfully very little
      collateral damage was done, preserving much of Muphrid‘s native splendor and
      its people‘s way of life. However, rumors of a Star League research facility
      deep in the jungles of MacArthur still send prospectors into the unknown—many
      never to return. Under the banner of the Lyran state, Muphrid continued to prosper,
      upset only by the occasional raid by Combine or Free Worlds forces during the
      Succession Wars. During the Jihad, Blakist forces launched a heavy strike on
      Muphrid to cripple its infrastructure, partially destroying the capital and
      several major cities, as well as many surrounding townships, before allied forces
      beat them back. Though a few tactical nuclear weapons were used, the majority
      of the damage has since been repaired and memorials to those who fell defending
      the planet against the Word of Blake now stand in New Dublin, Calenaton, Port
      MacArthur, and Mechanicsburg.
