      3060: Menkib was settled by the Capellan Confederation to take advantage of several particularly large deposits of germanium that were discovered. An added bonus was discovered when settlers first arrived, while much of the land is arid deserts or badlands, the coastal areas and the areas near several of the larger rivers are more or less temperate and exceptionally fertile allowing the population to feed itself. The planet has moderate levels of manufacturing, however the majority of industry comes from the planet’s mining and refining industries. Over the years, the germanium has become harder to find, though several other rare metals have also been discovered in smaller occurrences. Menkib made it through the Succession Wars relatively undamaged, though it was ultimately captured by the Federated Suns in the 4th Succession War and remained in the Federated Commonwealth until late 3057 when the realm was split and Operation Guerrero saw the Free Worlds League and Capellan Confederation take back many of their lost planets. After the loss of contact with the ‘central’ government of the FedCom, the local militia commander, Major Peter Nestin, used his forces to overthrow the old government and installed himself as dictator of the planet. Menkib was eventually re-absorbed into the Capellan Confederation in the early 3060s after Nestin was overthrown.

      Menkib has 25 hour days and orbits its sun every 37 standard days.
