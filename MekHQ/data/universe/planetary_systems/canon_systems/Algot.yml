      3135 - One of the first planets settled by early Tikonov explorers, by the beginning of the 29th century Algot was one of the most populous planets in the region. Algot was a major industrial centre specialising in computer and electronic sciences. Both the technological industry and population have declined significantly since.

      In 2822, mysterious plague hit the planet and disappeared the following year. The mysterious plague gave the Algot a reputation for being unhealthy, leading to heavy emigration and a lack of immigration, the main factor in the decline in population. However, for the past two centuries, the health of the general population has been exceptionally good and they enjoy the third-longest life expectancy in the Federated Suns.

      Algot has one continent, Camellias, situated across both the northern and southern hemispheres. With warm and temperate climates, Camellias‘ northern reaches are the most fertile, supplying the planet with all the food needed to sustain life. The capital city, Algot Prime, was founded on the northeastern coast of the continent, near fertile fishing grounds and an island off the coast where a large spaceport has been built. The southern part of the continent is mostly desert. A desert city, Cassol, is just north of the equator and is the regional capital. It was a large storage area for the AFFS. South of Cassol is Lake Ochiba, a large freshwater lake covering some 85,000 square kilometers. The lake supplies water for industries and local cities.

      During the Jihad, Word of Blake used disabling poisons to subdue the planet. The Blakists took the world with minimal force, though they did firebomb the military compound outside of Cassol, destroying the AFFS unit stationed there.
