      Noisiel is a planet with a mix of industry and agriculture located deep in the Lyran Commonwealth. The planet also boasts large tracts of uninhabited, unspoiled wilderness, which supports a sizable tourist trade. The tourists come attracted by a unique martial tradition established in 3047 by the wealthy Alextep family, hereditary landholders of Noisiel. The Noisiel Summer Games began as a challenge between father and son, Duke Michael, CEO of Alextep Engineering services and his son and primary rival, Heinrich, CEO of Heinrich SuppoTech Interstellar. The unique duel was planned to take place in the rolling hills of Duke Michael’s estate on the continent of Teppokhan Prime. All citizens of the planet were invited to watch, for a small ticket price (which was intended to pay for any repairs necessary to the two family-owned Atlases. The duel itself ended up being a ‘Mech-sized game of rugby, using a half-ton ballistic-polymer ‘ball’ and the game covered a full square kilometer of the estate.

      The event was advertised all over planet and on several surrounding and attracted a large crowd. And thus, after the Clan Invasion, which saw Heinrich serve a tour of duty with the AFFC, the tradition of the Noisiel Summer Games began. Now the Games are a 12 day event and mercenaries and solaris jocks alike are invited to join in to show off their ‘Mechs and piloting skills. The MechWarriors take part in a variety of sports on ‘Mech scale, including baseball, football, hocket, and chess, as well as unique ‘Mech-based “talent shows”, parades and pageants.
