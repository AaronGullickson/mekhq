      Helm has played a crucial role in the history of the Inner Sphere despite being a cold and uninviting backwater. During the time of the Star League the city of Freeport was home to the Star League Defense Force’s Fleet provisioning center. The planetary facilities were upgraded to include a Castle Brian with significant stores of provisions and war material. After the fall of the League this resulted in both Marik and Kurita forces arriving on planet to secure these assets for themselves. However, the Castle Brian was well hidden and though the Combine held the planet they were unable to find the resources and rumors led them to believe that the stockpiles had been taken on Kerensky’s Exodus or the Free Worlds League had already taken them.

      In retaliation Combine forces directed nuclear orbital bombardment on many of the civilian centers of the planet. The nuclear bombardment and subsequent fallout killed more than 80% of the planet’s population. Even in the 31st Century the wreckage of Freeport was still unsafe.

      Helm once again became famous in the mid 3020s when the Grey Death League discovered the lost Castle Brian and managed to recover the Helm Memory Core, which was then distributed to the rest of the Inner Sphere and began the technological renaissance of the mid-31st Century. Unfortunately for the citizens of Helm, they have seen few improvements to their quality of living based on the many advances cultivated from the Memory Core.
