      Early colonization efforts were baffled by the lack of life on Rochester. The planet had a comfortable atmosphere and plenty of water. Unfortunately it was soon discovered, when the transplanted animals and plants began to die, that the soil contained a unique mixture of minerals that when combined resulted in a poison for most lifeforms.

      With no immediate way to filter all the soil on the planet, the colonies were abandoned for years until the Star League developed systems capable of removing the toxins from the soil and water and colonies were re-established. Another lucky side-effect of the purification process was a unique ‘green jelly’ that contained unusual elements sought after by pharmaceutical companies.

      By the time the Star League collapsed, Rochester was extensively settled and had a steady economy. Unfortunately when the 1st Succession War broke out the planet’s purification plants took significant damage when the Draconis Combine captured the planet. Without the plants life quickly began to die off on Rochester and the Combine refused to allow the citizens to relocate or send food. Over 52,000 people died in what later became known as the Rochester Starvation.

      The planet barely survived through the Succession Wars since the technology behind the purification plants was lost and many of them were destroyed. However, in the early 31st century, scientists from the NIAS rediscovered the secret to the purification plants and the planet was able to slowly begin to recover.
