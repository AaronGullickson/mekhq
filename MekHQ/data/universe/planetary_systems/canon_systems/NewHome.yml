    desc: 3135 - Another early Terran colony world, established during humanity‘s
      first tentative steps to the stars, the features that drew many to New Home
      were the planet‘s pleasant and temperate climate, mountainous, resource-rich
      highlands, and many freshwater lakes and rivers. Industries looking to exploit
      the planet‘s mineral, chemical, and metal wealth flocked to New Home and set
      up shop with scores of hopeful young settlers looking to eke out a living on
      a brave new world. The large, pole-to-pole supercontinent of Spina Planetia,
      dominated by a central mountain chain called the Great Spine Mountains, drew
      the majority of the new colonists, who established cities and mining operations
      along the coastal regions and mountain bases. Many more, however, found the
      two secondary continents of Goldwynn and Arbergeiht, both located in the southern
      hemisphere, equally suitable for habitation, and there they set up smaller towns
      and agricultural communities. Findler, the capital city, was built on the northeastern
      plains of Spina Planetia, facing the eastern Tomagasso Ocean. Mann, site of
      the planet‘s largest spaceport, was established 700 kilometers to the south.
      When the Terran Hegemony placed New Home under its aegis, the world‘s strategic
      location, so close to Terra, necessitated the placement of an elaborate space
      defense network on the planet and in orbit around it. Much to the SLDF‘s dismay,
      this network fell under the control of the Usurper‘s troops when the Amaris
      crisis began, and the entire marvel of Star League military engineering had
      to be destroyed in the campaign to liberate Terra. Ruled by the Capellans after
      the fall of the League, New Home was frequently raided by the Free Worlds League
      and the Federated Suns, and ultimately became part of the Federated Commonwealth
      after the Fourth Succession War. When the Commonwealth fractured in 3057, New
      Home was left without any direction, and fell into anarchy that only ended when
      the Word of Blake managed to seize control during their effort to establish
      a buffer zone around Terra. Unlike other worlds, New Home hardly resisted the
      change in leadership, preferring the rule of the fanatics to total chaos. This
      allowed the Blakists to stage several major operations from the planet in relative
      security. The fighting to liberate New Home and break the Jihad caused widespread
      damage, which The Republic of the Sphere has invested a great deal of time and
      resources to undo.
