      3060: Mandate is a small, icy planet that is almost entirely locked in ice and tundra. The planet was originally settled by the Sarna Supremacy prior to the founding of the Star League to take advantage of the rich deposits of heavy metals discovered below the ice flows. Unfortunately for settlers, the cold is not the only problem. The planetâ€™s ecology was quickly discovered to be incompatible with human biology and as a result (and the cold not helping) almost all of the food on planet must be imported.

      The Succession Wars were not kind to Mandate and the loss of technology and numerous raids by the Federated Suns damaged the infrastructure of the planet and significantly reduced the industrial capabilities of the planet and the residents must now rely on imports for most goods, as well as food. Mining is the primary industry on Mandate.

      Mandate was often raided but did not change hands until the 4th Succession War when it was captured by the Federated Suns. After Operation Guerrero and the sundering of the Federated Commonwealth in late 3057, Mandate was left to fend for itself. The people of Mandate continued to run things as they had for the prior 20 years with a relatively efficient democracy. The biggest concern was securing sufficient imports. However, they managed to reach a deal with the planet Remshield exchanging mineral rights for goods.

      Mandate was eventually re-absorbed into the Capellan Confederation in the early 3060s.

      Mandate has a short 15 hour day and orbits its sun every 9 standard days.
