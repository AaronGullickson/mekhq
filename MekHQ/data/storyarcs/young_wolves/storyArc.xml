    <description># Young Wolves

In June of 3057, tension between the Wolf and Jade Falcon clans led to the outbreak of the Refusal War. Khan Elias Crichell of Clan Jade Falcon fought the war to destroy his most powerful rival to power. IlKhan Ulric Kerensky fought the war to weaken the fighting capability of the Crusader movement and thus delay the resumption of the drive to Terra. Far more than just a simple Trial of Refusal, the Refusal War at some point involved virtually the entire Touman of both clans and would lead directly or indirectly to the death of four Khans and the death, rebirth and sundering of one clan. The war's implications would ripple out far from the original belligerents to effect the balance of power in the Inner Sphere for a generation.

This is the story of a Trinary of young Wolf warriors eager to write their own line in the Remembrance through glory and sacrifice . The Refusal War will test their resolve, skill, and, most importantly, their loyalty.

              Hello, @commander. I am the chief tech on board here. I see you have been out busting up my machines. Do not worry, my team can fix almost anything, so we will get right on it. You can head over to the repair bay to check on our progress.

              We have quite a few parts and equipment in storage aboard the ship, but keep in mind that once those supplies are used up, we do not have access to anything more, given wartime shortages. So if you want to make sure you stay in supply, you will want to be sure to salvage whatever isorla you can from your battles. You can always check on our supplies by heading over to the warehouse.

              We also have some second-line mechs mothballed in the cargo bay. These mechs can be used to replace units that have been completely destroyed. Just keep in mind it will take some time to pull those units out of mothball so be sure to give me some advance warning.
