Welcome all to 0.49.7, the 20th anniversary of MegaMek's initial release! :beer:

This dev release is a recommended dev release. It's the most stable dev release of the current cycle, and will be the last dev release before we make a series of breaking internal changes.

Specifically, this release combines the suite-wide internal changes, tons of bugfixes, errata, and new MegaMek, MegaMekLab, and MekHQ features with the longest bug testing duration we've done (nearly a month of custom testing branches and a fifteen day code freeze). This is especially notable given that this is likely the final release to not include the very unstable but required changes planned for the next few dev releases relating to MegaMek save games, MegaMek connections, and supporting Java 17 for players.

. Further, MegaMekLab seen a bunch of bugfixes.

Personnel Randomization, Retirement, and Dependent options have seen major changes for 0.49.7.

The Personnel Randomization setup takes the previous setup and expands upon it. The main enhancement is the addition of the central system options for company generation and clan setups, but there are also other internal improvements. Further, this adds the new Retirement and Dependent setups, which are temporarily stopgap setups 

[b]MekHQ StratCon Alpha[/b]
StratCon has seen a few bugfixes since 0.49.6.

[b]Major Internal Changes[/b]
First, we've added uncaught exception handling, which means we can fix otherwise hidden and thus missed issues. This has already led to multiple important fixes originating back six plus years thanks to QA and nightly build finds. We believe the current fixes handle any known causes, but new reports because of this dialog will be critical for fixing longterm pre-existing issues including currently unknown issues.

Second, and technically expanding on the above, we've continued reworking our logging setup. Namely, we've created a legacy logging setup to temporarily handle MegaMek's remainining ancient logging (dating back to the early 2000's) formats and to handle anything current and the above logging has missed (zero known issues).

Third, we've updated the vast majority of our remaining dependencies to their latest releases. There are five remaining dependency updates, two of which are new updates. This leaves the three pre-existing, nasty, and extremely difficult issues. Specifically, the latter means that XStream (MegaMek's save game setup, and extremely outdated) needs a complete replacement before our next stable, JAXB (some internal XML setups) needs difficult internal updates, and JUnit (Unit Testing) needs to be migrated from release 4.* to latest 5.*. The XStream and two recent updates will be handled before 0.50.0, while JAXB and JUnit are unlikely to be handled in the near future.

Fourth, and finally, we've rewritten the MekHQ readme file to explain suite status and dependencies. This is primarily for developer use, but also provides an external view into our internals. MekHQ has implemented everything outside of Javadocs (currently these are broken builds suite wide, albeit with fixes open). MegaMek has implemented everything outside of Javadocs and the Code Coverage setup (both being immediate goals). MegaMekLab is in the worst state, and we are currently unsure as to whether it's a bug, the internal code, or the current design setup causing the current issues.

[b]Stable 0.50.0 Status Update[/b]
We are still working on the development portion of the current dev cycle. Primarily, we need to handle player Java 17 support, player save game issues (for the same reason as the previous), and connection stability issues (there's been regular connection stability reports since our last stable, without traceable causes [I've experienced this myself, with nothing logged, in multiplayer games]).

[b]Java 11[/b]
We've updated to Java 11, which means you'll need to update to use the [b]0.49.x development branches[/b]. As Java is now open source, we recommend [url=https://adoptium.net/index.html?variant=openjdk11]Adoptium Temurin 11[/url]. We have a help page [url=https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/wiki/Updating-to-Adoptium]for Windows[/url] and [url=https://megamek.org/wiki/mac_issues.html]Mac[/url]. Further, for Linux, you should be able to use your package manager to install Adoptium Temurin from their repository. Finally, all our automated tests (with the exception of MegaMekLab) are done with Temurin 11.

[b]Social Media[/b]
We are also happy to announce we have an [url=https://discord.gg/u2vJ5U2QpD]official MegaMek Discord[/url]. This is now our primary community location for the suite, providing superior voice support, individual channels, and assistance for the [url=https://megamek.games]official public servers[/url]. We do still have the legacy [url=https://bit.ly/2KSu5yQ]Slack channel[/url], which is rarely used outside of the developers. There are also the following community Discords with regular MegaMek channels, namely [url=https://discord.gg/gyXMWjT]Everything BattleTech[/url] and [url=https://discord.gg/D9jFn52]Classic BattleTech[/url]. We are also on Facebook, at [url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/5124394675]MegaMek BattleTech[/url] and [url=https://www.facebook.com/MegaMek]MegaMek[/url] for our group and page respectively.

UlyssesSockdrawer has been running a popular Solaris VII campaign on our Discord that is always looking for new players. You can join in the next week, and otherwise join between cycles. Join the Discord for more information.

[b]Updating Your Campaign:[/b]
1. Make backups of your campaigns and customs.
2. Always treat each release as a stand alone release and only copy your data forward from older versions, never backwards.
3. Do not copy MegaMek saves nor any preference file from a different version.
