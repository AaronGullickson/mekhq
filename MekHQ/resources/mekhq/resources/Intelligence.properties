  \ situations without a plan, struggles with complex ideas, and often needs things spelled out\

FOOLISH.description.1.regexp={0}''s reckless stupidity isn''t just a quirk - it''s a liability. {1}\

  \ {4}. One day, {6} bad decisions will catch up to {4}, and it won''t be pretty.
FOOLISH.description.2.regexp={0} means well, but {6} plans rarely make sense. {1}''s the guy who\
