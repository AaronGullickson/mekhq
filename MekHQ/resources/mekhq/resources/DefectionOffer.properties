bondsman.message=<p>{0}, I wanted to bring to your immediate attention a highly unusual development.\
  \ During the debrief following our most recent engagement; one of the captured Clan warriors has\
  \ formally declared themselves a Bondsman of our unit.</p>\
  <br>\
  <p>The warrior in question is identified as <b>{1}</b> of <b>{2}</b>. As you know, this is an\
  \ extraordinary gesture within Clan culture. For %s to bond themselves to our company, of all\
  \ things, is practically unheard of.</p>
defector.message={0}, we've received an offer of defection from an enemy combatant. Following our\
  \ most recent skirmish, <b>{1}</b>, formerly of the <b>{2}</b> military, has approached the guards\
  \ requesting to join us.
bondsman.ooc=This is a very rare event. Normal defectors suffer a Loyalty penalty when recruited\
  \ into a unit. Clan Bondsmen suffer no Loyalty penalty, require no pay, and are unlikely to\
  \ retire. Bondsmen are automatically recruited.
defector.ooc=Defectors suffer a Loyalty penalty when recruited into a unit, making them more\
  \ likely to resign or retire. Defectors can be recruited from the personnel tab. You may need to\
  \ change the filter to Prisoners. Defectors are marked with an asterisk.
defection.report=You have convinced {0} to defect.
bondsman.report=<b>{0}</b> is becoming a Bondsman. It will take up to 6 weeks for them to pass\
  \ security vetting and prove their loyalty.
