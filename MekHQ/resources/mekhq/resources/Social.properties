ALTRUISTIC.label=Altruistic
ALTRUISTIC.description.0.regexp=Others come first - always. Barry willingly steps into danger to\
  \ protect his team, gives up resources without hesitation, and never asks for anything in return.\
  \ Strength, in his eyes, is meant to shield, not to exploit.
ALTRUISTIC.description.1.regexp=No sacrifice is too great if it means saving others. Barry pushes\
  \ himself past exhaustion, taking the hardest missions and making the toughest calls, even when\
  \ no one asks him to. Eventually, he may give too much - leaving nothing of himself behind.
ALTRUISTIC.description.2.regexp=A firm believer in the greater good, Barry acts with a generosity\
  \ that others mistake for naivety. His willingness to help, even when it puts him at a\
  \ disadvantage, earns him both deep respect and ruthless exploitation from those less honorable.

APATHETIC.label=Apathetic
APATHETIC.description.0.regexp=Nothing really excites Barry, and nothing really bothers him either.\
  \ He does his job, follows orders, and goes through the motions, but there's no passion behind it\
  \ - just routine.
APATHETIC.description.1.regexp=After seeing too much death and betrayal, Barry has stopped caring.\
  \ He doesn't form attachments, doesn't believe in causes, and doesn't waste energy on emotions.\
  \ In his mind, caring only leads to pain.
APATHETIC.description.2.regexp=The universe is broken, and Barry knows it. He doesn't get involved\
  \ in arguments, doesn't waste time on idealism, and certainly doesn't stick his neck out for\
  \ anyone. As far as he's concerned, nothing really matters in the long run.

AUTHENTIC.label=Authentic
AUTHENTIC.description.0.regexp=Barry doesn't pretend to be something he's not. He speaks his mind,\
  \ stays true to his beliefs, and refuses to put on a mask just to impress others. What you see is\
  \ exactly what you get.
AUTHENTIC.description.1.regexp=No sugarcoating, no empty promises - Barry tells it like it is,\
  \ whether people want to hear it or not. He refuses to play politics or pretend to be something\
  \ he isn't, even if it makes him enemies.
AUTHENTIC.description.2.regexp=People trust Barry because he's real. He doesn't fake emotions,\
  \ doesn't manipulate, and doesn't care about putting on an act. His honesty may be blunt at\
  \ times, but it makes him both respected and reliable.

BLUNT.label=Blunt
BLUNT.description.0.regexp=Barry says exactly what's on his mind, with no concern for sugarcoating\
  \ or social niceties. If the truth is harsh, so be it - he sees no point in dressing it up.
BLUNT.description.1.regexp=There's no room for pleasantries in Barry's world. He delivers the hard\
  \ truths, whether people can handle them or not, cutting through delusion with words as sharp as\
  \ a blade. If someone's weak, incompetent, or making a mistake, he makes sure they know it.
BLUNT.description.2.regexp=While others waste time with diplomacy, Barry gets straight to the\
  \ point. He values efficiency over politeness and doesn't believe in dancing around the truth.\
  \ Some find his approach refreshing - others just find it frustrating.

CALLOUS.label=Callous
CALLOUS.description.0.regexp=Barry doesn't get attached. He sees suffering, loss, and hardship, but\
  \ none of it seems to affect him. Whether it's a defense mechanism or just who he is, he keeps\
  \ his emotions locked away and moves forward without hesitation.
CALLOUS.description.1.regexp=Compassion is a weakness Barry can't afford. He doesn't hesitate to\
  \ make hard decisions, sacrifice allies, or eliminate threats with cold efficiency. In his mind,\
  \ survival means shutting out anything that might make him hesitate.
CALLOUS.description.2.regexp=Barry believes in results, not feelings. He dismisses emotions as\
  \ distractions and refuses to waste time comforting others. To him, facts, logic, and action\
  \ matter - sympathy does not.

COMPASSIONATE.label=Compassionate
COMPASSIONATE.description.0.regexp=Barry genuinely cares about the people around him. He looks out\
  \ for his team, helps those in need, and does what he can to make life a little less cruel - even\
  \ in a universe that doesn't reward kindness.
COMPASSIONATE.description.1.regexp=Caring is a curse Barry can't shake. He feels the weight of\
  \ every loss, every sacrifice, and every person he couldn't save. No matter how much it hurts, he\
  \ refuses to stop trying - because if he does, he's no better than the monsters he fights.
COMPASSIONATE.description.2.regexp=Barry's compassion isn't just a trait - it's his strength. His\
  \ ability to see the good in people, to uplift those around him, and to fight not just for\
  \ himself, but for others, makes him a leader that people want to follow.

CONDESCENDING.label=Condescending
CONDESCENDING.description.0.regexp=Barry talks to people like they're always a step behind him -\
  \ because in his mind, they usually are. He assumes he knows best, rarely listens to advice, and\
  \ has little patience for those who can't keep up.
CONDESCENDING.description.1.regexp=Barry doesn't just look down on others - he barely acknowledges\
  \ them. He sees most people as incompetent, useless, or beneath him, and he makes no effort to\
  \ hide his disdain. If someone disagrees with him, he assumes they're simply too stupid to\
  \ understand.
CONDESCENDING.description.2.regexp=Barry always has a smug remark loaded, making it painfully clear\
  \ he thinks he's the smartest person in the room. Whether through subtle jabs or outright\
  \ mockery, he has a way of making others feel small without ever raising his voice.

CONSIDERATE.label=Considerate
CONSIDERATE.description.0.regexp=Barry always takes the time to think about how his actions affect\
  \ others. Whether it's checking in on his teammates, giving credit where it's due, or offering\
  \ help without being asked, he makes sure people feel valued and respected.
CONSIDERATE.description.1.regexp=In a ruthless world, Barry refuses to become another heartless\
  \ soldier. He watches out for those who can't protect themselves, even when it costs him. The\
  \ weight of every choice lingers in his mind, but he'd rather carry it than let others suffer.
CONSIDERATE.description.2.regexp=Barry isn't loud about his kindness, but it's there. A quiet word\
  \ of encouragement, a favor done without asking for thanks, or a small sacrifice to make\
  \ someone's life easier - he pays attention to what people need and acts on it, whether they notice\
  \ or not.

DISINGENUOUS.label=Disingenuous
DISINGENUOUS.description.0.regexp=Barry knows exactly what to say to get people on his side, but\
  \ his words rarely match his true intentions. He smiles, flatters, and makes promises, but\
  \ beneath it all, he's only looking out for himself.
DISINGENUOUS.description.1.regexp=Every word Barry speaks is calculated. He twists the truth, plays\
  \ people against each other, and pretends to care just enough to gain trust before using it to\
  \ his advantage. If someone thinks he's being sincere, they're already his next victim.
DISINGENUOUS.description.2.regexp=Barry never gives a straight answer. He dodges questions, avoids\
  \ commitments, and keeps people guessing about where he really stands. It's not outright lying -\
  \ it's just never letting anyone get close enough to see the truth.

DISMISSIVE.label=Dismissive
DISMISSIVE.description.0.regexp=Barry doesn't waste time on people or ideas he deems unimportant.\
  \ If he thinks someone's opinion is useless, he brushes them off without a second thought and\
  \ moves forward on his own terms.
DISMISSIVE.description.1.regexp=Barry has seen too much to care about petty concerns. He ignores\
  \ emotions, disregards complaints, and barely acknowledges those he considers beneath him. If\
  \ someone isn't immediately useful, they might as well not exist.
DISMISSIVE.description.2.regexp=Barry rarely takes others seriously, rolling his eyes at concerns\
  \ he doesn't find valid. Whether it's a risky plan, a personal grievance, or a suggestion he\
  \ thinks is dumb, he shuts it down with a snide remark and moves on.

ENCOURAGING.label=Encouraging
ENCOURAGING.description.0.regexp=Barry believes in his team and makes sure they know it. Whether\
  \ it's a few words of confidence before a mission or lifting someone up after a failure, he\
  \ always pushes others to be their best.
ENCOURAGING.description.1.regexp=Barry doesn't coddle - he drives people forward. His words are\
  \ sharp, his expectations high, but it's all to make sure those around him survive. If he's hard\
  \ on someone, it's because he refuses to let them fail.
ENCOURAGING.description.2.regexp=Barry's energy is contagious. He has a way of making even the\
  \ worst situations seem manageable, keeping morale high with a well-timed joke, an inspiring\
  \ speech, or a simple "You've got this."

ERRATIC.label=Erratic
ERRATIC.description.0.regexp=Barry's actions rarely follow a clear pattern. One moment, he's\
  \ cautious and methodical; the next, he's diving headfirst into chaos. His unpredictability keeps\
  \ enemies - and sometimes allies - on edge.
ERRATIC.description.1.regexp=There's no telling what Barry will do next, and that's what makes him\
  \ dangerous. His moods swing wildly, his plans shift without warning, and his reactions can be as\
  \ destructive to his allies as they are to his enemies.
ERRATIC.description.2.regexp=Barry thrives on spontaneity, making split-second decisions that seem\
  \ reckless - until they somehow work. He's impossible to predict, always thinking three steps ahead\
  \ in ways that make no sense to anyone but him.

EMPATHETIC.label=Empathetic
EMPATHETIC.description.0.regexp=Barry has a natural ability to sense what others are feeling. He\
  \ listens without judgment, offers genuine support, and always seems to know exactly what someone\
  \ needs to hear - whether they realize it or not.
EMPATHETIC.description.1.regexp=Barry feels everything - the pain, the fear, the suffering of those\
  \ around him. It weighs on him, but he refuses to turn away, even when caring too much becomes a\
  \ liability in a universe that rewards cruelty.
EMPATHETIC.description.2.regexp=Barry's strength isn't just in battle - it's in people. He connects\
  \ with others effortlessly, making them feel heard, valued, and understood. Whether leading a\
  \ team or comforting a friend, his empathy draws others to him.

FRIENDLY.label=Friendly
FRIENDLY.description.0.regexp=Barry is easy to like. He greets everyone with a smile, makes\
  \ conversation effortlessly, and genuinely enjoys getting to know people. Whether ally or\
  \ stranger, he treats everyone with kindness and respect.
FRIENDLY.description.1.regexp=Barry puts on a friendly face, but it's a survival tactic as much as\
  \ anything. He knows being likable keeps people from turning on him, but deep down, he's always\
  \ waiting for the moment when trust becomes a liability.
FRIENDLY.description.2.regexp=Barry can talk to anyone and make them feel like an old friend. His\
  \ charm, humor, and ability to find common ground make him the kind of person others naturally\
  \ gravitate toward, whether he's leading a team or sharing a drink.

GREGARIOUS.label=Gregarious
GREGARIOUS.description.0.regexp=No room stays quiet for long when Barry is around. He thrives on\
  \ conversation, easily making connections and ensuring that no one feels left out. Whether in a\
  \ warzone or a bar, he makes himself at home among people.
GREGARIOUS.description.1.regexp=Laughter and stories are his armor. Barry keeps the energy high and\
  \ the conversation flowing, but beneath the charm, there's a deep need to drown out the silence -\
  \ the kind that brings back ghosts best left forgotten.
GREGARIOUS.description.2.regexp=Crowds fuel him. Barry enjoys the spotlight, telling the best\
  \ stories, leading the wildest celebrations, and making sure everyone is having a good time. If\
  \ there's action, he's in the middle of it, keeping the momentum alive.

INSPIRING.label=Inspiring
INSPIRING.description.0.regexp=People rally behind Barry because he makes them believe. His\
  \ confidence, determination, and unwavering presence push others to go beyond their limits,\
  \ knowing that if he's leading, victory feels possible.
INSPIRING.description.1.regexp=In a brutal world where hope is a rare commodity, Barry refuses to\
  \ let it die. Even when everything is crumbling, his words, actions, and sheer force of will\
  \ remind others that there's still something worth fighting for.
INSPIRING.description.2.regexp=Barry doesn't just lead - he elevates those around him. Whether it's a\
  \ rousing speech before battle, a quiet word of encouragement, or leading by example, he makes\
  \ people feel like they can accomplish the impossible.

INDIFFERENT.label=Indifferent
INDIFFERENT.description.0.regexp=Barry doesn't get involved unless he has to. Other people's\
  \ problems, moral dilemmas, or even the bigger picture don't concern him - he focuses on what\
  \ directly affects him and ignores the rest.
INDIFFERENT.description.1.regexp=Nothing moves him anymore. Loss, suffering, and chaos are just\
  \ background noise, and he doesn't waste energy pretending to care. Whether someone lives or\
  \ dies, wins or loses - it's all the same in the end.
INDIFFERENT.description.2.regexp=Barry isn't cruel, but he doesn't see the point in getting\
  \ emotionally invested. He makes decisions based on logic, not feelings, and while others may\
  \ take things personally, he simply shrugs and moves on.

INTROVERTED.label=Introverted
INTROVERTED.description.0.regexp=Barry prefers to observe rather than dominate a conversation. He\
  \ speaks when necessary, keeps his thoughts to himself, and tends to recharge best when he's\
  \ alone rather than in a crowd.
INTROVERTED.description.1.regexp=People exhaust him, and trust is a luxury he can't afford. Barry\
  \ keeps his distance, avoids unnecessary interactions, and only engages when absolutely\
  \ necessary. Solitude isn't just a preference - it's survival.
INTROVERTED.description.2.regexp=While he doesn't seek attention, Barry notices everything. He\
  \ listens more than he speaks, analyzes before he acts, and values deep conversations over\
  \ shallow chatter. His quiet nature makes his words all the more impactful when he chooses to\
  \ share them.

IRRITABLE.label=Irritable
IRRITABLE.description.0.regexp=Barry has little patience for incompetence, delays, or pointless\
  \ chatter. He gets frustrated easily, especially when things aren't going according to plan, and\
  \ doesn't bother hiding his annoyance.
IRRITABLE.description.1.regexp=Everything grates on him - people, orders, even the sound of his own\
  \ comms. Barry is always on edge, snapping at allies and enemies alike. Whether it's stress,\
  \ trauma, or just who he is, his temper is a fuse ready to blow.
IRRITABLE.description.2.regexp=Barry is the guy who sighs loudly when someone asks a dumb\
  \ question. He rolls his eyes, mutters under his breath, and gets annoyed over small things - but\
  \ beneath the grumbling, he still gets the job done.

NARCISSISTIC.label=Narcissistic
NARCISSISTIC.description.0.regexp=Barry believes he's the smartest, strongest, and most important\
  \ person in the room. He craves attention, thrives on admiration, and makes sure everyone knows\
  \ just how exceptional he is.
NARCISSISTIC.description.1.regexp=Everything revolves around him - at least, that's how he sees it.\
  \ Barry uses people for his own gain, dismisses anyone who doesn't serve his interests, and\
  \ considers loyalty a one-way street where he's always at the top.
NARCISSISTIC.description.2.regexp=Barry loves the spotlight and works hard to stay in it. He\
  \ boasts, exaggerates, and makes sure his victories are as public as possible. While his ego can\
  \ be exhausting, his charm and sheer confidence make it hard to completely dislike him.

NEGLECTFUL.label=Neglectful
NEGLECTFUL.description.0.regexp=Barry doesn't intentionally ignore responsibilities - he just gets\
  \ caught up in his own world. Whether it's distractions, forgetfulness, or a lack of\
  \ organization, things tend to slip through the cracks more often than they should.
NEGLECTFUL.description.1.regexp=Barry simply doesn't care. Duties, relationships, and even his own\
  \ well-being are secondary to whatever he deems important at the moment. If something - or someone\
  \ - falls apart because of his inattention, that's their problem, not his.
NEGLECTFUL.description.2.regexp=Keeping up with details isn't a priority for Barry. He does the\
  \ bare minimum to get by, leaving others to pick up the slack. Whether it's out of laziness or\
  \ indifference, he rarely follows through unless it directly benefits him.

POMPOUS.label=Pompous
POMPOUS.description.0.regexp=Barry carries himself with exaggerated confidence, talking up his\
  \ achievements and acting as if he's the best pilot, strategist, and leader in the Inner Sphere.\
  \ While his boasting can be exhausting, there's just enough charm behind it to make it\
  \ entertaining.
POMPOUS.description.1.regexp=Barry sees himself as superior to everyone around him. He looks down\
  \ on others, dismisses their opinions, and expects recognition for his so-called brilliance. If\
  \ someone questions him, they're met with condescension at best - or outright hostility at worst.
POMPOUS.description.2.regexp=Barry loves the sound of his own voice, spending more time talking\
  \ about his greatness than actually proving it. He overcomplicates simple ideas, inserts himself\
  \ into situations just to show off, and acts as if every decision he makes is revolutionary - even\
  \ when it's not.

PETTY.label=Petty
PETTY.description.0.regexp=Barry never forgets a slight, no matter how small. Whether it's a lost\
  \ bet, a sarcastic remark, or someone taking his favorite seat, he finds ways to get back at\
  \ people - usually with just enough humor to keep it from being outright malicious.
PETTY.description.1.regexp=Every insult, every disagreement, every minor inconvenience is a\
  \ personal attack in Barry's mind. He holds grudges for years, going out of his way to make sure\
  \ anyone who crosses him regrets it, even if it costs him more than it's worth.
PETTY.description.2.regexp=Barry never lets things go, but he doesn't always act on it directly.\
  \ Instead, he makes snide comments, "forgets" to relay important information, and subtly\
  \ undermines people in ways that are just deniable enough to avoid confrontation.
