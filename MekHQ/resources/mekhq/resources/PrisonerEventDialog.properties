free.report=%s has been freed.
freeEvent0.message=%s, as ordered, we've released prisoners from the overcrowded sections. They\
  \ were processed swiftly, provided minimal supplies for their journey, and escorted beyond the\
  \ perimeter. The remaining prisoners seem calmer, though some voiced frustration about not being\
  \ included in the release.
freeEvent1.message=%s, we've freed a group of prisoners deemed least likely to pose a threat. They\

  \ population.
freeEvent2.message=%s, the release operation is complete. Twenty-five prisoners were carefully\

  \ transition went smoothly. Morale among the guards has improved, though the population remains\
  \ wary.
freeEvent3.message=%s, a number of prisoners were freed from the holding wing. They were escorted\
  \ to the outer perimeter, and the gates were sealed behind them. The atmosphere in the facility\
  \ has stabilized somewhat, with guards reporting a noticeable reduction in tension.

  \ violence. They were released at a secure checkpoint and directed away from the facility. The\
  \ remaining prisoners are subdued, and overcrowding has been significantly reduced.

  \ with no incidents during the transfer. The guards are reporting improved conditions in the\

freeEvent6.message=%s, as directed, we've released a group of low-risk prisoners. They were\
  \ processed and sent out under supervision. The mood among the guards is improving now that we've\
  \ eased the burden, though some prisoners still seem restless.

  \ orderly, and the guards ensured that none of the remaining population attempted to interfere.\
  \ Overcrowding is no longer an issue, and operations have stabilized.

  \ was completed without incident, and the holding cells are now operating within capacity. The\
  \ guards are resuming normal duties, and the remaining prisoners appear less agitated.

  \ processed and released with basic rations. The remaining prisoners are calmer now that the\
  \ overcrowding has been addressed. The guards have returned to their posts, and the situation is\
  \ stable.
freeEvent10.message=%s, per your directive, we've released some prisoners. Each individual was\
  \ processed thoroughly, ensuring no contraband or intelligence was removed from the facility.\
  \ They were escorted beyond the perimeter under close supervision. The operation proceeded\
  \ without incident, and the remaining prisoners are subdued for now.
freeEvent11.message=%s, the release of prisoners has been completed. The process went smoother than\
  \ expected, with no resistance from the remaining population. Overcrowding in the cells is no\
  \ longer an issue, and the guards are reporting a much-needed reprieve.
freeEvent12.message=%s, the prisoner release has been carried out. While the operation was\
  \ successful, some of our men expressed frustration at seeing hardened combatants set free.\
  \ Nonetheless, the cells are now at manageable levels, and we remain vigilant for any\
  \ repercussions.
freeEvent13.message=%s, as ordered, some prisoners were released earlier today. The process was\
  \ conducted methodically, ensuring no disruptions. While this decision has relieved pressure on\
  \ the facility, it's a calculated risk that we'll monitor closely.
freeEvent14.message=%s, prisoners have been processed and released from custody. The operation was\
  \ completed without complications, and the overcrowding in the holding area has been alleviated.\
  \ Guards are resuming standard operations.
freeEvent15.message=%s, the release of prisoners is complete. Each was escorted out under heavy\
  \ guard, and no incidents occurred during the operation. While this eases the strain on the\
  \ facility, we remain acutely aware of the potential consequences of their return to enemy\
  \ forces.
freeEvent16.message=%s, the transfer of prisoners has been completed successfully. The process went\
  \ according to plan, and the remaining detainees have been compliant since the release. The\
  \ facility is back within capacity, and the guards are reporting improved morale.
freeEvent17.message=%s, we've completed the prisoner release. While the immediate overcrowding\
  \ issue has been resolved, some of my men have expressed concern that we may have released\
  \ valuable assets back to the enemy. Nevertheless, the facility is stable for now.
freeEvent18.message=%s, prisoners have been released into enemy custody. While this decision has\
  \ brought relief to the holding areas, it's clear the remaining population is still watching\
  \ closely. The operation proceeded without incident, but the tension in the air remains palpable.
freeEvent19.message=%s, we've released some prisoners as instructed. The process was conducted\
  \ under strict oversight, ensuring compliance from the remaining detainees. We're maintaining\
  \ heightened vigilance to ensure this release doesn't embolden the remaining population.
freeEvent20.message=%s, we've released some prisoners. Many were barely able to walk, their bodies\
  \ frail from confinement. The look in their eyes spoke volumes - fear, anger, and the haunting\
  \ emptiness of souls broken by captivity. The operation is complete, but the weight of what we've\
  \ witnessed remains heavy.
freeEvent21.message=%s, prisoners have been freed. Their gaunt faces and trembling hands were a\
  \ stark reminder of the suffering they've endured. Some whispered words of home as they stepped\
  \ out, others said nothing at all. The guards are shaken; this wasn't an easy task.
freeEvent22.message=%s, we've carried out the prisoner release. Their condition is\
  \ harrowing - emaciated, covered in bruises, and barely clinging to what humanity remains. Some\
  \ clutched photographs or trinkets as they shuffled out, shadows of the warriors they once were.
freeEvent23.message=%s, the release of prisoners has been completed. Their state was worse than\
  \ expected - sunken eyes, skeletal frames, and the unmistakable marks of prolonged suffering. Some\
  \ cried as they left, others stared blankly ahead. This is a grim chapter for us all.
freeEvent24.message=%s, prisoners were freed today, though it feels like releasing ghosts. Their\
  \ bodies are wasted, their minds distant. Some guards avoided looking at them directly, ashamed\
  \ of the conditions we allowed to persist. The task is done, but the memory will linger.
freeEvent25.message=%s, we've released the prisoners. Their silent, hollow stares told us\
  \ everything we needed to know about their time here. A few clung to each other as they walked\
  \ out, their camaraderie the only thing keeping them from falling apart entirely.
freeEvent26.message=%s, the release of prisoners is complete. The sight of them leaving - many\
  \ limping, others being carried - was gut-wrenching. Their frailty and the haunted looks on their\
  \ faces left no doubt about the toll of captivity. It's a scene none of us will forget.
freeEvent27.message=%s, as ordered, prisoners were released today. Their gaunt frames and unsteady\
  \ steps were a chilling reminder of what captivity has done to them. Some guards muttered prayers\
  \ as they watched them go, grappling with the horrors we've witnessed firsthand.
freeEvent28.message=%s, the release of prisoners has been completed. The holding cells are quieter\
  \ now, but the memory of their suffering hangs heavy. Their skeletal forms and the marks of\
  \ restraint are a testament to the grim reality of war. We'll carry this burden long after\
  \ they've gone.
freeEvent29.message=%s, prisoners were freed today. Their condition was devastating - sunken cheeks,\
  \ scars both old and new, and a silence that seemed louder than any scream. The sight visibly\
  \ shook even my guards. The task is done, but the cost is something we'll all carry.
freeEvent30.message=%s, the prisoner release was completed, but it wasn't without incident. Some\
  \ prisoners refused to leave, claiming they had no homes to return to, while others argued\
  \ violently about who deserved freedom. Guards had to intervene multiple times to prevent\
  \ serious altercations.
freeEvent31.message=%s, prisoners were released, but the process descended into chaos. Fights broke\
  \ out among the prisoners as they vied for supplies, and several guards sustained minor injuries\
  \ trying to separate them. Order has been restored, but tensions remain high.
freeEvent32.message=%s, the prisoner release has been carried out, but some prisoners sabotaged\
  \ their cells before leaving, damaging locks and equipment. The release caused an uproar among\
  \ the remaining population, who're now demanding to know when they will be freed.
freeEvent33.message=%s, as we prepared to release the prisoners, a group of them resisted, accusing\
  \ us of sending them to their deaths. Some of the remaining prisoners joined in the shouting,\
  \ forcing my guards to act swiftly to regain control. The operation continued, but tensions are\
  \ simmering.
freeEvent34.message=%s, prisoners were released today, but the operation nearly collapsed when one\
  \ prisoner attempted to take a guard hostage, claiming they deserved "revenge" for their\
  \ treatment. The guard was unharmed, and the prisoner was restrained, but the mood remains\
  \ hostile.
freeEvent35.message=%s, the prisoner release was delayed when we discovered one of them had\
  \ sabotaged the gate mechanism to prevent the process from moving forward. Repairs took several\
  \ hours, and while the release was eventually completed, the incident has put everyone on edge.
freeEvent36.message=%s, prisoners were released today, but the process was marred by hostility.\
  \ Many hurled insults at the guards, blaming them for the conditions they endured. A few had to\
  \ be forcibly removed from the premises, escalating tensions among those left behind.
freeEvent37.message=%s, prisoners were freed today, but the operation caused a stir among the\
  \ remaining population. Prisoners not chosen for release have begun muttering about favoritism\
  \ and threatening to disrupt future operations. The guards are keeping a close eye on the\
  \ situation.
freeEvent38.message=%s, as we released the prisoners, one collapsed during the final checks,\
  \ claiming severe illness. The guards had to call for medical assistance, delaying the operation\
  \ and causing frustration among the other prisoners. The release was eventually completed, but\
  \ the situation left many guards on edge.
freeEvent39.message=%s, prisoners were released, but the operation turned tense when several of\
  \ them openly declared their intention to rejoin the fight against us. Their defiance unsettled\
  \ my men, and their words riled up the remaining population. While the release was completed, the\
  \ atmosphere in the facility is now significantly more volatile.
freeEvent40.message=%s, during the prisoner release, two rival prisoners shocked everyone by\
  \ shaking hands as they walked out. Their followers cheered, and the remaining prisoners are\
  \ abuzz with rumors of an alliance forming outside the facility. The guards are uneasy, as this\
  \ could spell trouble for the future.
freeEvent41.message=%s, as we prepared to release the prisoners, the commotion allowed three others\
  \ to slip past the guards unnoticed. We've secured the facility, and the missing prisoners are\
  \ accounted for. This incident has raised questions about security protocols during operations\
  \ like this.
freeEvent42.message=%s, the release of prisoners nearly failed when one of them detonated a hidden\
  \ explosive device just outside the perimeter, damaging the gates and a holding cell. The\
  \ prisoner claimed it was a "farewell gift." While the others left without incident, tensions in\
  \ the facility are high.
freeEvent43.message=%s, during the prisoner release, one of them suddenly collapsed and died before\
  \ they could leave. The cause is unclear, though initial signs point to malnutrition or\
  \ exhaustion. The incident delayed the operation, and the remaining prisoners are spreading\
  \ rumors of foul play.
freeEvent44.message=%s, as they were released, a group of prisoners held up scraps of fabric\
  \ stitched together into their faction's banner, chanting slogans of defiance. The display\
  \ enraged some of the remaining prisoners, leading to scuffles in the holding area. Guards\
  \ intervened to prevent further escalation.
freeEvent45.message=%s, prisoners were released, but not before conducting an eerie ritual in the\
  \ holding area. They marked their faces with soot, spoke in hushed chants, and vowed revenge\
  \ before leaving. My guards are deeply unsettled, and the remaining prisoners are whispering\
  \ about what the ritual meant.
freeEvent46.message=%s, during the prisoner release, guards discovered that two individuals\
  \ attempting to leave weren't on the release list. They had swapped identification with others\
  \ in the cells. The imposters were detained, but the real prisoners meant for release remain\
  \ unaccounted for, and we're conducting a headcount to determine their whereabouts
freeEvent47.message=%s, prisoners were released, but one left behind a chilling message scrawled on\
  \ the wall of their cell: "We'll meet again in the ashes." The guards are rattled, and the\
  \ remaining prisoners seem energized by the act. The situation in the holding area is growing\
  \ tense.
freeEvent48.message=%s, during the release, one guard was found attempting to leave disguised as a\
  \ detainee. When questioned, they confessed to trying to desert under the guise of the operation.\
  \ The situation was handled discreetly, but the remaining guards are questioning their loyalty to\
  \ the mission.
freeEvent49.message=%s, prisoners were freed today, but the operation took an emotional turn when\
  \ one of them spotted a guard they recognized from a past battle. Tensions flared, and the two\
  \ nearly came to blows before the situation was de-escalated. The release was completed, but the\
  \ incident has left both parties visibly shaken.

executeEvent0.message=%s, the prisoners have been executed as per your orders. We isolated them in\
  \ the eastern storage hangar to ensure no civilians or non-essential personnel were present. Each\
  \ was dealt with quickly and efficiently, minimizing unnecessary commotion.
executeEvent1.message=<p>%s, the task is done, but I'll be honest - I didn't sign up for this. These\
  \ were just warriors who surrendered when the odds turned. Some of them begged. I kept it\
  \ clean, no unnecessary pain, but this sits heavy.</p>\
  <p>The team's quiet now. Nobody's saying much, but I can see it on their faces. If this is the\
  \ new norm for our outfit, we might need to start asking ourselves who we're becoming.</p>
executeEvent2.message=%s, the prisoners have been eliminated as instructed. Execution took place in\
  \ the quarry, far from camp, ensuring no witnesses or disruptions. Disposal is handled; no\
  \ evidence remains.
executeEvent3.message=<p>%s, prisoners are no longer an issue. Execution was carried out in a\
  \ controlled manner behind the east perimeter. No complications arose, and the cleanup team has\
  \ finished their part.</p>\
  <p>Recommend avoiding this site for at least 48 hours while residual traces are dealt with.\
  \ Moving forward, it might be worth considering alternative methods to minimize resource use.</p>
executeEvent4.message=<p>%s, it's done. I don't like it, but it's done. You should know some of\
  \ these folks weren't even combatants anymore - they barely put up a fight. But hey, I'm\
  \ sure your spreadsheets say it makes sense to treat prisoners like liabilities.</p>\
  <p>If this is where we're headed as a company, I need to think about whether I belong here.</p>
executeEvent5.message=%s, the prisoners have been executed as per your directive. I ensured it was\
  \ handled as cleanly and professionally as possible. That said, I feel it's my duty to express\
  \ concern over the potential fallout of such actions. News travels fast, and this could harm our\
  \ reputation with future employers.
executeEvent6.message=%s, prisoners are taken care of. No mess, no fuss. One of them tried to talk\
  \ their way out, but we shut that down fast. No loose ends to worry about.
executeEvent7.message=<p>%s, the prisoners were dealt with, as you ordered. I carried out the task\
  \ personally, ensuring there was no unnecessary suffering. I'll be blunt - I don't know how the\
  \ team will respond to this long-term. Morale's already shaky, and this sort of thing has a way\
  \ of sticking with people.</p>\
  <p>I suggest we give the squad some downtime to process. I'll do what I can to keep things\
  \ steady.</p>
executeEvent8.message=%s, the prisoners are no longer a factor. I understand there may be\
  \ criticism, but let's be clear: they were a security risk. Even under guard, we couldn't\
  \ guarantee they wouldn't escape or sabotage our operations.
executeEvent9.message=%s, prisoners are handled. Nothing fancy, nothing drawn out - they're gone. Let\
  \ me know if there's anything else you need cleaned up.
executeEvent10.message=<p>%s, it's done. I can't say I feel good about it, but I don't suppose that\
  \ matters. They were defeated, powerless - part of me wonders what we achieve by killing men who've\
  \ already lost.</p>\
  <p>Still, I followed through because that's what you expect. Orders are orders, and I'm here to\
  \ do the job. I just hope this isn't the kind of thing that defines us moving forward.</p>
executeEvent11.message=<p>%s, the prisoners have been dealt with, but we encountered complications.\
  \ Two of them overpowered a guard and tried to escape before the execution. We neutralized them,\
  \ but one of our people took a knife to the leg. The rest were executed without further\
  \ incident.</p>\
  <p>Recommend reviewing security procedures to avoid future disruptions. Let me know if you need a\
  \ full report.</p>
executeEvent12.message=%s, we carried out the execution as ordered, but I've just received\
  \ confirmation that one of the prisoners was an allied operative. Their credentials didn't check\
  \ out during processing. I take full responsibility for the oversight and await your instructions\
  \ on handling the fallout.
executeEvent13.message=%s, the task is complete, but there's a problem. Civilians from a nearby\
  \ settlement stumbled onto the site just after we began. They saw too much before we could\
  \ disperse them. If they decide to talk, this could blow back on us hard.
executeEvent14.message=%s, execution of the prisoners is done, but there were complications with\
  \ the team. One guard refused to participate outright and has since isolated himself from the\
  \ unit. Another is showing signs of severe distress. The task weighed heavily on all of us.
executeEvent15.message=<p>%s, the prisoners sabotaged their holding area before we moved them for\
  \ execution. They jammed the gate mechanism and damaged some of the restraints. It delayed the\
  \ operation by several hours, and we had to subdue them with stun rounds before proceeding.</p>\
  <p>The task is now complete, but it wasn't clean. I'll include a report on the equipment damage\
  \ for review.</p>
executeEvent16.message=%s, we began the execution as ordered, but conflicting instructions from\
  \ central command reached us mid-task, demanding the prisoners be kept alive for questioning. Two\
  \ were already dealt with before the halt. The remaining three have been restrained and returned\
  \ to holding.
executeEvent17.message=%s, the execution turned chaotic. While en route to the site, one of the\
  \ prisoners triggered a concealed explosive device during a struggle. Two guards were lightly\
  \ injured, and three prisoners were killed in the blast. The remaining two were executed\
  \ afterward, but the incident could draw unwanted attention.
executeEvent18.message=<p>%s, we encountered complications at the execution site. Sudden\
  \ bad weather forced us to abandon the operation mid-task. The high winds made\
  \ it unsafe to proceed, and transporting the prisoners back to base was risky, but they're\
  \ secured in the auxiliary bunker for now.</p>\
  <p>Once the storm clears, we'll carry out your orders.</p>
executeEvent19.message=<p>%s, the execution order was carried out, but it didn't go smoothly. One\
  \ of the prisoners incited the others to attack while being moved to the site. They managed to\
  \ lightly injure a guard and nearly succeeded in overpowering another. The mutiny was suppressed,\
  \ but it forced us to execute them on the spot instead of the planned location.</p>\
  <p>The situation is contained, and cleanup is underway. We'll double-check procedures to prevent\
  \ another incident.</p>
executeEvent20.message=<p>%s, it's done. I can't shake the sound they made, though - the pleading,\
  \ the sobbing. They knew what was coming, and that's what makes this so much worse. These weren't\
  \ combatants anymore. They were just... people.</p>\
  <p>We did what you asked, but I'll tell you this: some things don't wash off, no matter how many\
  \ orders you follow.</p>
executeEvent21.message=<p>%s, the prisoners are gone, but I can't stop thinking about the way they\
  \ looked at me. Not angry or defiant - just scared. One of them even said thank you when I offered\
  \ them water before the end. I keep asking myself if that was mercy or cruelty.</p>\
  <p>I don't know how to forget their faces.</p>
executeEvent22.message=<p>%s, the order has been carried out, but there was a problem. One of my\
  \ men refused to follow through. He broke down during the task, crying and shaking. I had to\
  \ finish their part myself. I'll handle discipline on my end, but... I think they're shattered.\
  \ This kind of thing breaks people.</p>\
  <p>Recommend pulling him from active duty for now.</p>
executeEvent23.message=<p>%s, the prisoners begged. They begged right up until the end. I didn't\
  \ want to listen, but it's impossible to block out. One of them swore they'd do anything if we\
  \ let them go - offered us intel, even credits. I carried out the task because I know the price of\
  \ disobedience.</p>\
  <p>But their voices keep echoing in my head. I did the job, but what kind of people does this\
  \ make us?</p>
executeEvent24.message=<p>%s, the job is done. It's quiet here now - too quiet. No one on the team is\
  \ speaking, not even the usual chatter on comms. You can feel it hanging in the air, the weight\
  \ of what we just did.</p>\
  <p>I know this is part of the business, but today, it feels like we crossed a line that we can't\
  \ uncross.</p>
executeEvent25.message=<p>%s, the last prisoner was unarmed, kneeling, and crying. They didn't even\
  \ resist, just asked to see their family one last time. I... I made sure it was quick, but it\
  \ didn't feel like mercy. It felt like murder.</p>\
  <p>I know we have reasons for this, but it's starting to feel like we're no better than the\
  \ people we're fighting.</p>
executeEvent26.message=<p>%s, it's done. The bodies have been disposed of, but the team is falling\
  \ apart. Two guards are talking about leaving the company, saying they can't handle this kind of\
  \ work. Another hasn't said a word since it happened.</p>\
  <p>If we keep giving orders like this, we'll lose more than just soldiers - we'll lose our\
  \ humanity.</p>
executeEvent27.message=<p>%s, one of the prisoners asked if they could pray before we executed\
  \ them. I allowed it, thinking it might bring them peace. Instead, it tore the team apart\
  \ emotionally. Some of us couldn't look away. One guard even started crying.</p>\
  <p>The task was completed, but it left us all shaken. This isn't just killing enemies - it's\
  \ killing hope.</p>
executeEvent28.message=<p>%s, the prisoners are gone. Their last words won't leave me. One cursed\
  \ us, one begged, and another just kept saying, "It's not fair." I thought I was hardened to this\
  \ kind of thing, but something about this order feels... wrong.</p>\
  <p>We carried it out because that's what we do, but I don't know how much more of this the\
  \ team - or I - can take.</p>
executeEvent29.message=<p>%s, it's done. I followed through personally, just like you asked. I\
  \ washed my hands afterward, but I can still feel the blood. It doesn't matter how many times I\
  \ tell myself they were enemies - there's something deeply wrong about killing people who can't\
  \ fight back.</p>\
  <p>I don't know if I'm the person you think I am, but I'll keep trying to be.</p>
executeEvent30.message=<p>%s, it's over, but the walk back felt endless. None of us said a word.\
  \ The prisoners were crying, shouting, some just staring, resigned. When it was done, all I could\
  \ hear was the wind.</p>\
  <p>I know we've done worse things in combat, but this feels different. It wasn't war - it was\
  \ slaughter. The guards under my command will follow orders, but today I think we lost a piece of\
  \ ourselves.</p>\
  <p>I'll follow your lead, as always, but I had to tell you what this cost us.</p>
executeEvent31.message=%s, it's done, but the screams won't stop. They didn't go quietly. Some\
  \ of them cried for their families, others screamed until their voices broke. Even when it was\
  \ over, the echoes felt louder than the gunshots.
executeEvent32.message=<p>%s, it's done. One of them asked if their mother would find out what\
  \ happened to them. I told them no. I lied. Then I pulled the trigger.</p>\
  <p>Whatever these orders accomplish, I hope you're ready to live with them. Because I'm not sure\
  \ if I can.</p>
executeEvent33.message=<p>%s, it's done, but not without incident. Half the team refused to go\
  \ through with it, and the others forced them aside to finish the job. There was shouting,\
  \ cursing, even a fistfight before it was over. These weren't soldiers - it was like watching\
  \ animals tear each other apart.</p>\
  <p>I'm not sure if the team will ever recover from this. Maybe none of us will.</p>
executeEvent34.message=<p>%s, they knew what was coming before we even lined them up. Some tried to\
  \ joke, saying, "Make it quick." Others just knelt, trembling, as if they were already dead. The\
  \ worst part was the silence afterward, the sound of boots on blood-soaked ground.</p>\
  <p>We followed orders, but it felt like a massacre.</p>
executeEvent35.message=<p>%s, one of my men broke down halfway through, sobbing as they pulled the\
  \ trigger. I had to step in and finish their part. Now they're curled up in a corner of the\
  \ barracks, shaking like a child.</p>\
  <p>You can give us orders, but you can't make us forget what we've done.</p>
executeEvent36.message=<p>%s, one of the prisoners offered me everything - credits, intel, even their\
  \ own house - if I spared them. They were shaking so hard they could barely speak. I carried out\
  \ your orders anyway, but I'll never forget the way their voice cracked as they begged.</p>\
  <p>Whatever we gained today, it wasn't worth this.</p>
executeEvent37.message=<p>%s, it's done, but I'll never forget the way they looked at me in those\
  \ final moments. Not hatred, not defiance - just confusion. Like they couldn't believe we were the\
  \ ones doing this to them.</p>\
  <p>I keep asking myself: when we became monsters?</p>
executeEvent38.message=<p>%s, the execution site was a horror show. We dug a trench and lined them\
  \ up. When it was over, we had to push the bodies into the pit with a loader. The stench, the\
  \ blood - it's burned into my senses.</p>
executeEvent39.message=<p>%s, one of the prisoners started singing. It was a slow, mournful\
  \ song - something about home. The others joined in, even as we raised our weapons. The sound\
  \ didn't stop until the last one fell.</p>\
  <p>I've never heard anything so beautiful, and I hope I never do again.</p>
executeEvent40.message=<p>%s, it's done, but I have to ask: what do we tell ourselves to justify\
  \ this? That they were enemies? That they would've done the same to us? I've killed men on the\
  \ battlefield, but this wasn't war. This was slaughter, plain and simple.</p>\
  <p>The blood's on my hands now, but I hope it haunts you too.</p>
executeEvent41.message=<p>%s, we moved the prisoners to the site as ordered, but the conditions\
  \ were brutal. The march was longer than expected, and we had no water to spare. When some\
  \ collapsed, the guards shot them on the spot to keep the others moving.</p>\
  <p>By the time we reached the site, half were dead already. The ones who made it didn't even\
  \ resist - they were too weak. This wasn't an execution. It was slow, grinding death.</p>
executeEvent42.message=<p>%s, the task is complete. We took the prisoners into the forest, one by\
  \ one, and finished it there. I thought this would feel efficient, but instead, it was drawn out\
  \ and sickening. Each one realized what was happening when the sound of gunfire reached them.</p>\
  <p>The bodies are buried, but the stench lingers. We've buried more than people today. We've\
  \ buried our humanity.
executeEvent43.message=<p>%s, the prisoners were executed, but the guards got carried away.\
  \ Civilians who were suspected of aiding them - women, children, the elderly - were rounded up as\
  \ well. By the time I realized what was happening, our firing squads were already at work.</p>\
  <p>This was chaos. There was no justice here, just blood. I'll submit a report, but I don't\
  \ know if we can clean this one up.</p>
executeEvent44.message=<p>%s, the prisoners are dead, but this wasn't an execution - it was a\
  \ massacre. Some of the guards recognized them as the ones who ambushed our supply convoy last\
  \ month. They didn't wait for an order - they started shooting, laughing, and kicking the bodies\
  \ when it was over.</p>\
  <p>I tried to restore discipline, but it was too late. This was about vengeance, not orders.</p>
executeEvent45.message=<p>%s, the prisoners were executed, but some of the guards took it too far.\
  \ Before the task was complete, they... I won't put the details in writing, but what happened\
  \ before their deaths was nothing short of barbaric.</p>\
  <p>If this comes to light, it won't just destroy the company's reputation - it'll destroy us.</p>
executeEvent46.message=<p>%s, by the time we reached the prisoners, they were too weak to stand.\
  \ Whoever was supposed to feed them failed, and they hadn't eaten in days. Most of them were\
  \ delirious, begging for water, food, anything.</p>\
  <p>We carried out the execution anyway, but this wasn't punishment - it was a mercy killing. What's\
  \ the point of this?</p>
executeEvent47.message=<p>%s, the executions took hours. We lined them up in groups, forced them to\
  \ kneel, and shot them one at a time. By the end, one of the guards dropped their weapon and\
  \ started screaming. Another tried to run into the forest to escape the sight of it all.</p>\
  <p>The rest of us finished the job, but I'm not sure any of us will ever come back from this.</p>
executeEvent48.message=<p>%s, it's done. We didn't just execute them; we erased them. No records,\
  \ no graves, no witnesses. It's as if they never existed.</p>\
  <p>My men are shaken. Some of them whispered about what happens when our turn comes - when we're\
  \ deemed expendable, too.</p>
executeEvent49.message=<p>%s, your instructions to delay the execution for "psychological impact"\
  \ worked too well. The prisoners were made to dig their own graves, standing by as we pretended\
  \ to debate their fate. Some collapsed, crying, begging. One tried to throw themselves on our\
  \ rifles to end it early.</p>\
  <p>When we finally carried it out, it wasn't just them who broke. Two guards started shaking so\
  \ badly they couldn't hold their weapons, and another swore they'd never take another order like\
  \ this again. We followed through, but at a cost, I'm not sure if this team will survive.</p>

# MINOR
eventMinor0.message=%s, we've just had an incident in the holding area. Two groups of prisoners got into\
  \ a heated argument - seems to be over some kind of personal grudge or perceived slight. We managed\
  \ to break it up before it got physical, but tensions are still high. Recommend increased patrols\
  \ in that sector and monitoring for any signs of further conflict. Awaiting further instructions.
responseMinorA0.button=Remind them who's in charge.
responseMinorA0.tooltip=Issue a stern warning that insubordination won't be tolerated.
responseMinorA0.success=%s, the stern warning had the desired effect. The prisoners backed down,\
  \ and tensions in the holding area have eased. While there are still some mutterings of\
  \ discontent, the groups appear unwilling to escalate further. Order has been maintained for now.
responseMinorA0.failure=%s, the warning backfired. Rather than quelling the conflict, it only\
  \ seemed to provoke both groups further. They've grown defiant, blaming the guards for taking\
  \ sides. The situation in the holding area is more volatile than ever, and the guards are\
  \ struggling to maintain control.
responseMinorB0.button=Keep them separated
responseMinorB0.tooltip=Assign different holding areas to prevent further conflict.
responseMinorB0.success=%s, the groups have been assigned to separate holding areas, and the move\
  \ has successfully defused the immediate tension. Guards report that both groups are settling\
  \ down now that they're no longer in close proximity. The situation appears stable.
responseMinorB0.failure=%s, separating the groups hasn't resolved the issue. Instead, both are\
  \ using the distance to spread rumors and rally their allies. Guards report an increase in\
  \ hostilities, with tensions spilling into other areas of the facility. Containment is becoming\
  \ a challenge.
responseMinorC0.button=Let them work it out
responseMinorC0.tooltip=Avoid intervening. Sometimes enemies need to settle things themselves.
responseMinorC0.success=%s, the decision to let them handle their dispute on their own seems to\
  \ have worked. The groups appear to have reached an uneasy truce without further intervention.\
  \ Guards report that the situation has calmed down, and the holding area is returning to normal.
responseMinorC0.failure=%s, letting the groups work it out was a mistake. The argument reignited\
  \ and quickly escalated into a physical brawl, forcing guards to intervene. Several prisoners and\
  \ one guard sustained injuries in the chaos. The situation has been brought under control, but\
  \ the damage is done.

eventMinor1.message=%s, we've got an unusual situation in the holding area. One of the prisoners has\
  \ been keeping the others entertained with wild stories about daring escapes and beating\
  \ impossible odds. The guards overheard a few prisoners joking about trying their "techniques." It\
  \ might just be harmless talk, but it's worth keeping an eye on them and their audience. Suggest we\
  \ step up vigilance and maybe isolate them if things escalate. Your call.
responseMinorA1.button=Let them enjoy their stories
responseMinorA1.tooltip=A little morale boost for the prisoners might keep them calmer.
responseMinorA1.success=%s, allowing the prisoners to enjoy the stories seems to have had a\
  \ positive effect. The mood in the holding area has improved, and the prisoners appear more\
  \ relaxed. Guards report no signs of the stories being taken seriously as escape plans, and\
  \ tensions are low.
responseMinorA1.failure=%s, letting the stories continue backfired. The prisoners became\
  \ emboldened, treating the tales as inspiration rather than entertainment. Guards have overheard\
  \ more serious conversations about escape attempts, and tensions are rising in the holding area.
responseMinorB1.button=Shut this down
responseMinorB1.tooltip=Order the guards to interrupt the story sessions. No need to encourage bad ideas.
responseMinorB1.success=%s, the guards put a stop to the story sessions, and the ringleader has\
  \ been warned to keep quiet. While some prisoners grumbled, the disruption has prevented the\
  \ stories from gaining any further traction. The situation in the holding area has stabilized.
responseMinorB1.failure=%s, shutting down the stories sparked backlash among the prisoners. They're\
  \ accusing the guards of trying to crush any small semblance of morale. The ringleader is now\
  \ stirring up resentment against the staff, and the mood in the holding area is more volatile.
responseMinorC1.button=Listen in carefully
responseMinorC1.tooltip=Have your guards take note of the tales - there might be useful intel hidden in his words.
responseMinorC1.success=%s, the guards carefully monitored the story sessions and noted several key\
  \ details. While most of it was harmless fiction, one tale revealed a potential weak point in the\
  \ facility's security that could have been exploited. The issue has been addressed, and the\
  \ holding area remains secure.
responseMinorC1.failure=%s, listening in didn't yield useful intel, but it did let the stories\
  \ continue unchecked. The prisoners are starting to view the storyteller as a leader, and his\
  \ audience has grown. Guards are reporting a subtle shift in the holding area's dynamics, and\
  \ there's concern it could lead to trouble.

eventMinor2.message=%s, we caught a prisoner tampering with a vent in the holding cells. The breach has\
  \ been patched, but the prisoner insists it was "just for better air circulation." It doesn't add\
  \ up, and we suspect they might've been testing security or planning something more. Recommend\
  \ reviewing footage and increasing patrols in the area. Let me know if we should isolate or\
  \ interrogate the prisoner further.
responseMinorA2.button=Send a message
responseMinorA2.tooltip=Punish the prisoner harshly to deter further attempts.
responseMinorA2.success=%s, the prisoner was punished harshly, and the display of authority has\
  \ deterred further tampering. Guards report that the other prisoners seem intimidated, and there\
  \ have been no signs of additional security breaches. The situation appears to be under control.
responseMinorA2.failure=%s, punishing the prisoner harshly backfired. The rest of the population\
  \ viewed it as excessive, sparking outrage and minor disturbances in the holding area. While the\
  \ tampering has stopped, tensions are running high, and the guards are on edge.
responseMinorB2.button=Move him to solitary
responseMinorB2.tooltip=Quarantine the prisoner as a precaution.
responseMinorB2.success=%s, the prisoner was moved to solitary confinement, and the holding area\
  \ has settled down. Guards report that removing him has lowered the risk of coordinated\
  \ tampering, and no further incidents have been observed. The facility is stable for now.
responseMinorB2.failure=%s, moving the prisoner to solitary has only fueled rumors among the\
  \ population. Many believe he was punished unfairly, and whispers of unrest are spreading. Guards\
  \ are reporting increased hostility from the other prisoners, and tensions are rising.
responseMinorC2.button=Let it slide, for now
responseMinorC2.tooltip=There's no harm done - this time.
responseMinorC2.success=%s, the decision to let the incident slide has de-escalated the situation.\
  \ The prisoner has returned to their cell without further issue, and the holding area is calm.\
  \ Guards are keeping a close watch, but so far, there's no indication of additional tampering.
responseMinorC2.failure=%s, letting the prisoner off the hook has emboldened the population. Guards\
  \ are reporting more frequent tampering attempts, and the holding area has grown more chaotic.\
  \ It's clear the prisoners view the lack of consequences as a sign of weakness.

eventMinor3.message=%s, my men have reported overhearing strange conversations among the prisoners. One\
  \ of them seems to be passing coded messages to others - nothing explicit, but it's clear they're\
  \ trying to keep it under the radar. We haven't cracked what they're saying yet, but it might be\
  \ worth isolating the suspected messenger and monitoring closely. Advise on next steps.
responseMinorA3.button=Eavesdrop
responseMinorA3.tooltip=Assign a guard to decipher the code and gather intelligence.
responseMinorA3.success=%s, the guard assigned to monitor the conversations successfully cracked\
  \ the code. It appears the prisoners were attempting to coordinate a minor disruption, but the\
  \ plot was uncovered before it could be executed. The suspected prisoners have been isolated, and\
  \ the facility remains secure.
responseMinorA3.failure=%s, the attempt to monitor the prisoners failed. The coded messages were\
  \ too cryptic to decipher in time, and it's clear the prisoners have become more cautious. Guards\
  \ are now reporting increased coordination among the population, indicating a potential larger\
  \ scheme.
responseMinorB3.button=Interrogate the ringleader
responseMinorB3.tooltip=Confront the suspected prisoner directly.
responseMinorB3.success=%s, the interrogation revealed the ringleader's plans. They admitted to\
  \ attempting to organize a coordinated effort to disrupt the guards but folded under pressure.\
  \ The operation was dismantled, and the ringleader has been isolated. Order has been restored in\
  \ the holding area.
responseMinorB3.failure=%s, the interrogation yielded no useful information. The ringleader refused\
  \ to cooperate, and their defiance has only emboldened the other prisoners. Guards report an\
  \ uptick in suspicious behavior, and tensions in the holding area are rising.
responseMinorC3.button=Ignore it
responseMinorC3.tooltip=The guards are stretched thin - focus on bigger problems.
responseMinorC3.success=%s, ignoring the coded conversations seems to have been the right call.\
  \ Guards report no unusual behavior since, and the suspected ringleader has not attempted further\
  \ communication. The situation appears stable, and the holding area is calm for now.
responseMinorC3.failure=%s, ignoring the situation was a mistake. The prisoners used the\
  \ opportunity to coordinate more effectively, and guards are now reporting suspicious activity\
  \ across multiple sections of the facility. Whatever they were planning has likely escalated.

eventMinor4.message=%s, we've got a situation with the prisoners complaining about the rations, saying\
  \ they're insufficient. A handful of them have refused to eat and are demanding changes before\
  \ they cooperate. So far, it's contained, but this could escalate if more prisoners join in.\
  \ Requesting guidance on how to proceed - do we negotiate, enforce compliance, or handle this\
  \ another way?
responseMinorA4.button=Give them extra rations
responseMinorA4.tooltip=Better-fed prisoners are less likely to cause problems.
responseMinorA4.success=%s, providing extra rations successfully defused the situation. The\
  \ prisoners are visibly calmer, and guards report that even the most vocal protestors have\
  \ resumed eating. While this approach taxed the supply line slightly, it has restored order in\
  \ the holding area.
responseMinorA4.failure=%s, the decision to provide extra rations backfired. The prisoners took it\
  \ as a sign of weakness, and now even more are making demands. Guards are struggling to maintain\
  \ control as the holding area grows increasingly restless.
responseMinorB4.button=Stick to the rules
responseMinorB4.tooltip=Rations are fine as they are. They'll eat when they're hungry enough.
responseMinorB4.success=%s, sticking to the established rations worked as intended. After several\
  \ days, the protesting prisoners began eating again, realizing their demands wouldn't be met.\
  \ Guards report that tensions have eased, and the situation is back under control.
responseMinorB4.failure=%s, refusing to adjust the rations has escalated the conflict. More\
  \ prisoners are joining the protest, and several have started inciting unrest among the\
  \ population. Guards are reporting increased hostility, and the holding area is becoming\
  \ volatile.
responseMinorC4.button=Investigate the supply line
responseMinorC4.tooltip=Check with your quartermaster - are the prisoners being shorted?
responseMinorC4.success=%s, the investigation revealed that an issue in the supply chain was indeed\
  \ shorting the prisoners' rations. Once corrected, the prisoners calmed down, and the protest\
  \ ended peacefully. The guards are now monitoring distribution to ensure this doesn't happen\
  \ again.
responseMinorC4.failure=%s, the investigation revealed no discrepancies in the supply line, but the\
  \ delay in addressing the situation emboldened the prisoners. Guards report that tensions have\
  \ escalated, and the protest has spread to a larger portion of the population.

eventMinor5.message=%s, we've uncovered a growing contraband trade among the prisoners. They're\
  \ exchanging scraps of mech parts, trinkets, and even messages. So far, it looks harmless, but\
  \ the scale is increasing, and we're concerned it might lead to something bigger. Recommend\
  \ stepping up inspections and confiscating the items before it becomes a larger security risk.\
  \ Awaiting your instructions.
responseMinorA5.button=Confiscate everything
responseMinorA5.tooltip=Shut the operation down and punish the traders.
responseMinorA5.success=%s, the guards conducted a sweep of the holding area, confiscating all\
  \ contraband and punishing those involved in the trade. The operation sent a clear message, and\
  \ the prisoners seem deterred from further attempts. The holding area is secure, and order has\
  \ been restored.
responseMinorA5.failure=%s, confiscating the contraband caused an uproar among the prisoners. They\
  \ viewed the operation as excessive and retaliated by organizing protests and refusing to \
  cooperate. Guards are reporting increased hostility, and tensions in the holding area are at a\
  \ breaking point.
responseMinorB5.button=Turn a blind eye
responseMinorB5.tooltip=Small trades keep them occupied and less likely to start trouble.
responseMinorB5.success=%s, allowing the small trades to continue has kept the prisoners occupied\
  \ and relatively peaceful. Guards report no signs of escalation, and the contraband trade appears\
  \ to be more of a distraction than a threat. The holding area remains stable for now.
responseMinorB5.failure=%s, ignoring the contraband trade backfired. The operation grew larger and\
  \ more organized, eventually leading to the discovery of weapons and tools that could pose a\
  \ serious security threat. The guards are now scrambling to contain the fallout from this\
  \ oversight.
responseMinorC5.button=Control the market
responseMinorC5.tooltip=Assign guards to oversee and profit from the contraband trade.
responseMinorC5.success=%s, assigning guards to oversee the contraband trade allowed us to keep the\
  \ operation contained and under control. The prisoners are satisfied with their ability to trade,\
  \ and the guards are using the oversight to gather intelligence. The holding area is calm, and no\
  \ security risks have emerged.
responseMinorC5.failure=%s, attempting to control the contraband market backfired. The guards'\
  \ involvement was discovered, leading to accusations of corruption from both prisoners and staff.\
  \ The resulting unrest has destabilized the holding area, and trust in our authority is eroding.

eventMinor6.message=%s, one of my guards has reported feeling drained after extended shifts managing\
  \ the prisoners, particularly with the recent uptick in unruly behavior. Morale across the\
  \ security team seems to be slipping - some of the others are showing signs of frustration as well.\
  \ We may need to adjust the rotation schedule or provide some kind of support to prevent burnout.\
  \ Requesting guidance on how to proceed.
responseMinorA6.button=Give them a break
responseMinorA6.tooltip=Reassign guards temporarily to less stressful duties.
responseMinorA6.success=%s, reassigning guards to less stressful duties has worked wonders for\
  \ morale. The team appears more rested and capable of handling the challenges in the holding\
  \ area. The improved rotation schedule has restored order among the staff without compromising\
  \ security.
responseMinorA6.failure=%s, reassigning guards caused a staffing shortage in critical areas. The\
  \ reduced presence in the holding area emboldened the prisoners, and guards report an increase in\
  \ unruly behavior. Morale among the remaining staff has only worsened under the added pressure.
responseMinorB6.button=Hire more help
responseMinorB6.tooltip=Reach out to a nearby planet or mercenary unit for additional guards.
responseMinorB6.success=%s, the reinforcements arrived quickly, providing much-needed support for\
  \ the existing security team. The extra manpower has eased the workload, and morale has\
  \ noticeably improved. The facility is stable, and the guards are operating effectively once\
  \ again.
responseMinorB6.failure=%s, the attempt to hire additional help failed. The reinforcements were\
  \ delayed or unavailable, leaving the existing team stretched to the breaking point. Morale\
  \ continues to plummet, and the guards are now struggling to maintain control in the holding area.
responseMinorC6.button=Toughen them up
responseMinorC6.tooltip=Remind your team that discipline is part of the job.
responseMinorC6.success=%s, a firm reminder about discipline and duty has strengthened the guards'\
  \ resolve. While the workload remains heavy, the team has stepped up to the challenge and\
  \ regained control of the holding area. Morale is holding steady, and order has been maintained.
responseMinorC6.failure=%s, pushing the guards harder backfired. The team is now visibly exhausted,\
  \ and several guards have voiced resentment about the lack of support. Morale has deteriorated\
  \ further, and the risk of errors in the holding area is increasing rapidly.

eventMinor7.message=%s, a prisoner is stirring up trouble in the holding area. They've been loudly\
  \ proclaiming that their "rescue is imminent," and it's starting to catch the attention of other\
  \ prisoners. I'm concerned his defiance might inspire further unrest if we don't\
  \ address it quickly. Recommend isolating him or taking measures to shut this down before it\
  \ escalates. Awaiting your orders.
responseMinorA7.button=Silence him
responseMinorA7.tooltip=Put the officer in solitary confinement to quiet his voice.
responseMinorA7.success=%s, the prisoner was moved to solitary confinement, cutting off his ability\
  \ to spread rumors. Without his influence, the holding area has calmed down. Guards report that\
  \ the remaining prisoners seem less agitated, and the risk of unrest has been minimized.
responseMinorA7.failure=%s, moving the prisoner to solitary confinement only fueled the rumors. The\
  \ other prisoners now believe his claims even more strongly, assuming we're trying to silence the\
  \ truth. Guards report increased hostility, and tensions in the holding area are on the rise.
responseMinorB7.button=Debate him publicly
responseMinorB7.tooltip=Allow your officers to refute his claims in front of the prisoners.
responseMinorB7.success=%s, officers publicly refuted the prisoner's claims, pointing out\
  \ inconsistencies in his story and challenging him to provide proof. The performance discredited\
  \ him in the eyes of the other prisoners, who have started ignoring his outbursts. The holding\
  \ area is stable once again.
responseMinorB7.failure=%s, the public debate backfired. The prisoner used the opportunity to rally\
  \ support, twisting the officers' words to strengthen his narrative. The other prisoners seem\
  \ emboldened, and guards are struggling to contain the unrest spreading through the holding area.
responseMinorC7.button=Let him rant
responseMinorC7.tooltip=His words will ring hollow when no rescue arrives.
responseMinorC7.success=%s, allowing the prisoner to continue ranting proved effective. With no\
  \ rescue arriving, his claims began to sound hollow, and the other prisoners lost interest.\
  \ Guards report that the holding area has returned to normal, and the prisoner's influence has\
  \ faded.
responseMinorC7.failure=%s, ignoring the prisoner's outbursts was a mistake. His confidence and\
  \ persistence convinced the other prisoners that a rescue was indeed imminent. The population is\
  \ now agitated, and guards are reporting signs of coordinated unrest. The situation is\
  \ deteriorating.

eventMinor8.message=%s, one of the prisoners is claiming to have experience repairing mechs. They've\
  \ offered to assist in exchange for improved rations and better living conditions. Could be an\
  \ opportunity to make use of their skills, but there's always the risk they're overstating their\
  \ abilities - or worse, planning something. Recommend evaluating their background and skills before\
  \ making a decision. Let me know how you want to proceed.
responseMinorA8.button=Use his skills
responseMinorA8.tooltip=Allow him limited access to a workshop under heavy supervision.
responseMinorA8.success=%s, the prisoner was granted limited access to the workshop under strict\
  \ supervision. It turns out his claims were genuine. He repaired several critical parts on\
  \ our mechs, saving valuable time and resources. The guards reported no incidents, and the\
  \ operation was a success.
responseMinorA8.failure=%s, allowing the prisoner into the workshop was a mistake. He sabotaged\
  \ several components before being caught, leaving the equipment in worse condition than before.\
  \ The guards restrained him before he could do further damage, but the incident has raised\
  \ questions about our screening process.
responseMinorB8.button=Keep him locked up
responseMinorB8.tooltip=It's too risky to trust a prisoner with that kind of access.
responseMinorB8.success=%s, the decision to keep the prisoner locked up was prudent. Guards later\
  \ found contraband schematics in his cell, indicating he was likely planning to sabotage our\
  \ mechs rather than repair them. The holding area remains secure, and the situation is under\
  \ control.
responseMinorB8.failure=%s, denying the prisoner access backfired. News of his offer spread among\
  \ the population, and now many prisoners are accusing us of wasting their talents. Tensions in\
  \ the holding area are rising, and guards are reporting an uptick in defiance and minor\
  \ disruptions.
responseMinorC8.button=Test his knowledge
responseMinorC8.tooltip=Ask him a series of questions to gauge his expertise.
responseMinorC8.success=%s, the prisoner's answers to the technical questions confirmed his\
  \ expertise. His knowledge appears to be legitimate, and granting him supervised access to the\
  \ workshop could be a safe way to capitalize on his skills. The guards report no unusual behavior\
  \ from him so far.
responseMinorC8.failure=%s, the prisoner's answers to the test were convincing at first, but upon\
  \ closer inspection, they were riddled with inaccuracies. It's clear he was bluffing. Guards\
  \ report that the other prisoners are mocking him, and the holding area is calmer now that his\
  \ credibility has been shattered.

eventMinor9.message=%s, several prisoners have come down with unexplained symptoms - weakness, coughing,\
  \ and fatigue. I'm concerned it could spread, but the prisoners are blaming the\
  \ conditions in the holding cells. We've isolated the affected individuals for now, but we may\
  \ need to investigate further to rule out a larger issue. Requesting advice on next steps to\
  \ contain this and maintain order.
responseMinorA9.button=Quarantine the sick
responseMinorA9.tooltip=Prevent further spread by isolating the afflicted prisoners.
responseMinorA9.success=%s, the quarantine was effective. The symptoms were contained to the\
  \ isolated group, and no new cases have emerged. Guards ensured the process was orderly, and the\
  \ holding area is stable. The prisoners seem to understand the necessity of the measure, and\
  \ tensions remain low.
responseMinorA9.failure=%s, the quarantine caused a panic among the remaining prisoners, who now\
  \ fear they might be next. Guards report unrest in the holding area, with several prisoners\
  \ accusing us of neglect and inhumane treatment. The symptoms have begun appearing outside the\
  \ quarantine as well, suggesting it may have already spread.
responseMinorB9.button=Improve their conditions
responseMinorB9.tooltip=Allow better ventilation and clean water to improve health.
responseMinorB9.success=%s, allowing better ventilation and providing clean water has alleviated\
  \ the symptoms. The affected prisoners are recovering, and the others seem more at ease now that\
  \ the conditions have been addressed. Guards report a noticeable improvement in morale across the\
  \ holding area.
responseMinorB9.failure=%s, the effort to improve conditions was too little, too late. The symptoms\
  \ have continued to spread, and the remaining prisoners now view this as a sign of weakness.\
  \ Tensions are climbing in the holding area, and the guards are struggling to maintain control.
responseMinorC9.button=Wait it out
responseMinorC9.tooltip=Let nature take its course - this could reduce the number of prisoners causing trouble.
responseMinorC9.success=%s, waiting it out proved to be the right decision. The symptoms subsided\
  \ on their own, and the affected prisoners have returned to their cells without further incident.\
  \ The guards have resumed normal operations, and the holding area remains stable.
responseMinorC9.failure=%s, waiting it out was a disastrous decision. The illness spread rapidly,\
  \ overwhelming both the prisoners and the guards. The holding area is in chaos, and guards are\
  \ struggling to contain the unrest. Several prisoners have accused us of intentionally letting\
  \ this happen, further destabilizing the situation.

eventMinor10.message=%s, we've got a situation involving one of the prisoners and a crew member. The\
  \ prisoner recognized them from a previous campaign, and the two exchanged some tense words.\
  \ Sounds like there's some unresolved history that could cause friction if it escalates.\
  \ Recommend keeping them separated for now and determining if this history poses a security risk.\
  \ Let me know how you want to handle it.
responseMinorA10.button=Let them sort it out
responseMinorA10.tooltip=Personal matters aren't your concern.
responseMinorA10.success=%s, allowing the prisoner and the crew member to handle it themselves\
  \ appears to have resolved the tension. The two exchanged a few more sharp words but ultimately\
  \ backed down without further incident. The holding area remains calm, and guards report no\
  \ additional issues.
responseMinorA10.failure=%s, letting them handle it themselves led to a serious confrontation. The\
  \ prisoner and the crew member came to blows, forcing guards to intervene. Both parties are\
  \ injured, and the incident has stirred up unrest among the other prisoners, who now see the crew\
  \ as vulnerable.
responseMinorB10.button=Intervene and mediate
responseMinorB10.tooltip=Talk to both parties to resolve the issue.
responseMinorB10.success=%s, the mediation worked. Speaking with both parties defused the tension,\
  \ and they agreed to avoid further conflict. The guards are keeping a close watch, but the\
  \ situation appears resolved for now, and the holding area is stable.
responseMinorB10.failure=%s, the mediation attempt failed. The crew member refused to let the\
  \ matter go, and the prisoner retaliated with accusations that stirred up anger among the\
  \ population. Tensions are rising in the holding area, and guards report that the prisoner is\
  \ trying to rally others against the crew.
responseMinorC10.button=Separate them immediately
responseMinorC10.tooltip=Avoid further conflict by assigning them to different areas.
responseMinorC10.success=%s, separating the prisoner and the crew member has successfully\
  \ de-escalated the situation. Both parties have been reassigned to different areas, and guards\
  \ report no further interactions or signs of tension. The holding area is calm for now.
responseMinorC10.failure=%s, separating them only fueled the prisoner's anger. They've started\
  \ spreading stories about their history with the crew member, stirring up resentment among the\
  \ other prisoners. Guards are now reporting signs of unrest, and the situation is becoming\
  \ volatile.

eventMinor11.message=%s, we've discovered crude graffiti on the walls of the holding cells. It's an\
  \ unflattering depiction of you, accompanied by slogans promoting rebellion. While it's likely\
  \ meant to rile up the other prisoners, it's also a sign that tensions might be higher than we\
  \ realized. We've cleaned it up, but we recommend increased vigilance in the holding area to\
  \ prevent further incidents. Your guidance on next steps would be appreciated.
responseMinorA11.button=Clean it up
responseMinorA11.tooltip=Order the prisoners to scrub the walls themselves.
responseMinorA11.success=%s, the prisoners were ordered to scrub the walls themselves, and the act\
  \ of cleaning seems to have embarrassed and subdued them. Guards report that the prisoners have\
  \ been quieter since the incident, and no further graffiti has been discovered.
responseMinorA11.failure=%s, forcing the prisoners to clean up the graffiti sparked resentment.\
  \ They viewed it as a humiliation tactic and have grown even more defiant. Guards report an\

responseMinorB11.button=Ignore it
responseMinorB11.tooltip=A little art won't hurt morale.
responseMinorB11.success=%s, ignoring the graffiti proved to be a wise decision. Without attention,\
  \ the prisoners lost interest in their 'art' and moved on to other distractions. Guards report no\
  \ further incidents, and tensions in the holding area appear to be under control.
responseMinorB11.failure=%s, choosing to ignore the graffiti only emboldened the prisoners. New\
  \ slogans and drawings have appeared, spreading throughout the holding area and fostering a sense\
  \ of defiance among the population. Guards are now concerned about the growing unrest.
responseMinorC11.button=Investigate the source
responseMinorC11.tooltip=Question prisoners to find out who's behind the graffiti.
responseMinorC11.success=%s, questioning the prisoners led to the identification of the ringleader\
  \ behind the graffiti. They've been isolated, and guards report that the incident has not been\
  \ repeated. The remaining prisoners appear more subdued now that the instigator has been dealt\
  \ with.
responseMinorC11.failure=%s, the investigation failed to uncover the responsible party, but it did\
  \ succeed in agitating the prisoners. They viewed the questioning as harassment, and tensions in\

  \ population.

eventMinor12.message=%s, a group of prisoners has started holding loud, daily prayer sessions. While\

responseMinorA12.button=Allow it
responseMinorA12.tooltip=Religious freedom shouldn't be curtailed, as long as it doesn't cause problems.
responseMinorA12.success=%s, allowing the prayer sessions to continue has helped ease tensions\

  \ prisoners still grumble about the noise, guards report that the overall mood in the holding\
  \ area is stable.
responseMinorA12.failure=%s, allowing the prayer sessions has led to increased friction in the\
  \ holding area. Non-participating prisoners are growing resentful, viewing the allowance as\
  \ favoritism. The conflict between the groups is escalating, and guards are struggling to\
  \ maintain order.
responseMinorB12.button=Move them elsewhere
responseMinorB12.tooltip=Set aside a space for their worship, away from the others.
responseMinorB12.success=%s, the decision to designate a separate space for worship has\
  \ successfully reduced the disruption in the main holding area. The worshippers are satisfied\
  \ with the arrangement, and the other prisoners seem calmer now that the noise is no longer an\
  \ issue. Guards report that the situation is under control.
responseMinorB12.failure=%s, moving the worshippers only created more tension. The other prisoners\
  \ viewed the allocation of a separate space as favoritism, and the worshippers themselves\
  \ complained about being isolated. Guards are reporting growing hostility between the groups, and\
  \ the situation is becoming volatile.
responseMinorC12.button=Ban it outright
responseMinorC12.tooltip=No religious practices on your watch - it's too divisive.
responseMinorC12.success=%s, banning the prayer sessions has restored order to the holding area.\
  \ While the worshippers initially protested, they have since complied, and the friction with\
  \ other prisoners has subsided. Guards report a return to normal operations in the facility.
responseMinorC12.failure=%s, banning the prayer sessions backfired. The worshippers are furious and\
  \ have begun spreading dissent among the prisoners, accusing us of violating their rights. The\
  \ holding area is now rife with tension, and guards are reporting signs of escalating unrest.

eventMinor13.message=%s, two prisoners were caught bartering a pack of cigarettes for what appears to be\
  \ "sensitive information" regarding our unit's operations. I've overheard parts of the\

  \ you want to handle this.
responseMinorA13.button=Confiscate everything
responseMinorA13.tooltip=Crack down on bartering and contraband trading.
responseMinorA13.success=%s, the contraband was confiscated, and a thorough sweep of the holding\
  \ area uncovered additional items tied to bartering activities. The crackdown has disrupted their\
  \ trading network, and guards report no further suspicious activity. The situation appears\
  \ contained.
responseMinorA13.failure=%s, confiscating contraband sparked an uproar among the prisoners. They\
  \ see it as an overreach, and tensions in the holding area are rising. Worse, the traders clammed\
  \ up, leaving us with no further insight into what information they were sharing. The issue\
  \ remains unresolved.
responseMinorB13.button=Interrogate them separately
responseMinorB13.tooltip=Find out what information they're exchanging.
responseMinorB13.success=%s, interrogating the prisoners separately revealed critical details. One\
  \ prisoner admitted to passing outdated intel in exchange for contraband, but the information\
  \ poses no current threat to operations. The ringleaders have been isolated, and the guards\
  \ report no further incidents.
responseMinorB13.failure=%s, the separate interrogations failed. Both prisoners provided\
  \ conflicting stories, and now the rest of the population is suspicious of our methods. Guards\
  \ report whispers of conspiracy and growing hostility among the prisoners, making the holding\
  \ area increasingly volatile.
responseMinorC13.button=Let it slide
responseMinorC13.tooltip=It's probably just rumors; no harm done.
responseMinorC13.success=%s, letting the incident go appears to have defused the situation quietly.\
  \ The prisoners involved have resumed their routines without further trouble, and guards have\
  \ detected no signs of continued bartering or information exchanges. The holding area remains\
  \ calm.
responseMinorC13.failure=%s, ignoring the situation was a mistake. Further investigation revealed\
  \ that sensitive operational details were indeed being passed along, and it's unclear how far\
  \ this information has spread. The lapse in security has shaken morale among the guards, and the\
  \ risk of future breaches has increased.

eventMinor14.message=%s, a captured officer is refusing to share quarters with enlisted prisoners,\

responseMinorA14.button=Treat them equally
responseMinorA14.tooltip=Everyone gets the same conditions, no matter their rank.
responseMinorA14.success=%s, enforcing equal conditions for all prisoners has eased tensions among\
  \ the enlisted population. While the officer initially protested, they've since complied. Guards\
  \ report a noticeable decrease in hostility, and the holding area is stable once again.
responseMinorA14.failure=%s, forcing the officer to share quarters with the enlisted prisoners\
  \ backfired. The officer's complaints have riled up the rest of the population, leading to\
  \ arguments and minor scuffles. Guards are reporting increased unrest, and the situation is\
  \ becoming harder to contain.
responseMinorB14.button=Give the officer his way
responseMinorB14.tooltip=Sometimes maintaining the chain of command keeps order.
responseMinorB14.success=%s, granting the officer separate accommodations appears to have prevented\
  \ further escalation. While the enlisted prisoners grumbled about it at first, they seem to have\
  \ accepted the decision. Guards report that the situation has calmed, and order is holding in the\
  \ holding area.
responseMinorB14.failure=%s, allowing the officer separate accommodations has worsened the\
  \ situation. The enlisted prisoners see it as blatant favoritism, and tensions have erupted into\
  \ open defiance. Guards are struggling to maintain control, and the holding area is on the verge\
  \ of chaos.
responseMinorC14.button=Use it to your advantage
responseMinorC14.tooltip=Subtly pit the groups against each other to keep them distracted.
responseMinorC14.success=%s, subtly encouraging division between the officer and the enlisted\
  \ prisoners has worked. The groups are too focused on their own arguments to organize against\
  \ the guards. The holding area is tense, but the distractions have kept the prisoners manageable\
  \ for now.
responseMinorC14.failure=%s, the attempt to exploit the tension backfired. The prisoners saw\
  \ through the manipulation and turned their frustration toward the guards. Guards report growing\
  \ hostility, and the holding area is now more unstable than ever.

eventMinor15.message=%s, we've discovered some prisoners running a dice-based gambling game, using\

  \ now or monitor it for the time being? Awaiting your guidance.
responseMinorA15.button=Break it up
responseMinorA15.tooltip=Gambling could lead to fights; it's not worth the risk.
responseMinorA15.success=%s, the gambling operation was shut down swiftly. Guards confiscated the\
  \ dice and currency without incident, and the prisoners involved returned to their cells without\
  \ protest. The holding area is calm, and no signs of tension have been observed since.
responseMinorA15.failure=%s, breaking up the gambling game caused an uproar. The prisoners accused\
  \ the guards of overstepping, and several have become openly defiant. The situation in the\
  \ holding area is now more volatile, with guards reporting an increase in tension and unrest.
responseMinorB15.button=Let it continue
responseMinorB15.tooltip=Harmless fun might keep morale from dropping too low.
responseMinorB15.success=%s, allowing the gambling game to continue has provided a harmless\
  \ distraction for the prisoners. Guards report that morale in the holding area has improved,\
  \ and no disputes have arisen. The situation remains stable, and the prisoners seem more\
  \ cooperative overall.
responseMinorB15.failure=%s, allowing the gambling game to continue led to trouble. A heated\
  \ dispute over winnings erupted into a physical fight, forcing guards to intervene. Several\
  \ prisoners were injured, and the holding area is now on edge. Guards are monitoring closely to\
  \ prevent further incidents.
responseMinorC15.button=Tax the winnings
responseMinorC15.tooltip=Use it as a way to assert control over the prisoners.
responseMinorC15.success=%s, the decision to tax the winnings has established control over the\
  \ gambling operation. The prisoners grudgingly accepted the arrangement, and the guards are\
  \ using the proceeds to maintain order. Tensions are low, and the holding area is running\
  \ smoothly.
responseMinorC15.failure=%s, attempting to tax the gambling operation backfired. The prisoners\
  \ accused the guards of exploitation, and the situation escalated into open defiance. Guards are\
  \ now struggling to maintain order, and the holding area is becoming increasingly unstable.

eventMinor16.message=%s, one of my men has been observed chatting a bit too amicably with the\
  \ prisoners. Other guards are concerned this could lead to information leaks or compromise\

  \ directly, but I'd appreciate your guidance on how to proceed to prevent any further risks.
responseMinorA16.button=Warn the guard
responseMinorA16.tooltip=A stern reminder to keep professional boundaries.
responseMinorA16.success=%s, the guard was given a stern warning about maintaining professional\
  \ boundaries. They acknowledged the concern and have adjusted their behavior accordingly. Guards\
  \ report no further issues, and the situation appears to be under control.
responseMinorA16.failure=%s, the warning seemed to have little effect. The guard's interactions\
  \ with the prisoners have continued, and other guards are now voicing concerns about divided\
  \ loyalties. Tensions among the staff are rising, and security may be at risk.
responseMinorB16.button=Reassign them
responseMinorB16.tooltip=Move the guard to a different post to avoid further issues.
responseMinorB16.success=%s, the guard was reassigned to a different post, reducing their contact\
  \ with the prisoners. The transition was smooth, and the other guards have reported feeling more\
  \ confident about the security of the holding area. The issue appears resolved.
responseMinorB16.failure=%s, reassigning the guard created unintended friction among the team. Some\
  \ guards believe the reassignment was unfair, while others remain suspicious of the guard's\
  \ intentions. The resulting discord has lowered morale and strained the security team.
responseMinorC16.button=Investigate further
responseMinorC16.tooltip=Is this a simple mistake, or is the guard being manipulated?
responseMinorC16.success=%s, the investigation revealed no malicious intent - just a lapse in\
  \ judgment. The guard has been counseled, and their interactions with the prisoners have returned\
  \ to a professional standard. The holding area is secure, and the guards' concerns have been\
  \ eased.
responseMinorC16.failure=%s, the investigation uncovered evidence of manipulation by the prisoners.\
  \ It seems the guard was being coerced into providing minor favors, which could have escalated if\
  \ left unchecked. While the guard has been removed, the prisoners now seem emboldened, and\
  \ tensions are higher in the holding area.

eventMinor17.message=%s, one of the prisoners has been sobbing uncontrollably during the night,\

  \ at play. Requesting your direction.
responseMinorA17.button=Leave them be
responseMinorA17.tooltip=This is not your problem to solve.
responseMinorA17.success=%s, leaving the prisoner alone allowed the situation to settle on its own.\
  \ The other prisoners eventually grew tired of the noise and stopped reacting to it. Guards\
  \ report that tensions in the holding area have eased, and order has been maintained.
responseMinorA17.failure=%s, ignoring the situation made things worse. The sobbing prisoner's\
  \ behavior escalated, causing significant disruption in the holding area. Other prisoners began\
  \ to grow more restless, and guards report increased hostility as a result of the disturbance.
responseMinorB17.button=Offer counseling
responseMinorB17.tooltip=Send in a MedTech or crew member to calm the prisoner.
responseMinorB17.success=%s, sending in a crew member to speak with the prisoner calmed them down\
  \ significantly. It seems they were overwhelmed by fear and isolation, and the conversation\
  \ helped restore their composure. The holding area is quieter now, and tensions have eased.
responseMinorB17.failure=%s, the attempt at counseling failed. The prisoner became even more\
  \ distraught, claiming they couldn't trust anyone. The visible turmoil has affected the other\
  \ prisoners, leading to heated arguments and unrest. Guards are struggling to maintain order in\
  \ the holding area.
responseMinorC17.button=Silence them
responseMinorC17.tooltip=Order the guards to restore order, no matter the method.
responseMinorC17.success=%s, the guards stepped in to restore order, and the sobbing prisoner has\
  \ been moved to a quieter area. While some prisoners muttered complaints, the intervention\
  \ stopped the disruption, and the holding area has returned to normal operations.
responseMinorC17.failure=%s, silencing the prisoner caused an uproar. The other prisoners saw it as\
  \ unnecessary cruelty, leading to widespread defiance and an increase in tension. Guards report\
  \ that the holding area is on edge, and the risk of further unrest has grown significantly.

eventMinor18.message=%s, we've discovered a stash of propaganda leaflets hidden among the prisoners'\
  \ possessions. It's unclear whether they're being used to boost morale or as part of an\
  \ undercover effort. Either way, this could pose a risk if it spreads. We've confiscated the\
  \ materials for now, but we may need to interrogate the prisoners involved to determine their\
  \ intent. Let us know how you want to proceed.
responseMinorA18.button=Destroy the leaflets
responseMinorA18.tooltip=Eliminate the material before it spreads.
responseMinorA18.success=%s, the leaflets were destroyed immediately. Guards made it clear that\
  \ such materials won't be tolerated, and the prisoners seem to have taken the message seriously.\
  \ No further propaganda has been discovered, and the situation remains under control.
responseMinorA18.failure=%s, destroying the leaflets only angered the prisoners. They've started\

  \ area. Guards are now reporting a rise in defiance and mutterings of rebellion.
responseMinorB18.button=Interrogate the source
responseMinorB18.tooltip=Find out who smuggled it in and why.
responseMinorB18.success=%s, interrogating the prisoners involved uncovered the source of the\
  \ propaganda. It seems to have been smuggled in with supplies from an outside faction. With this\
  \ information, we've secured the supply lines and prevented further incidents. The holding area\
  \ is stable.
responseMinorB18.failure=%s, the interrogation didn't yield any useful information. Instead, it\
  \ caused unrest among the prisoners, who now view it as an overreach. Guards report increased\
  \ hostility and a concerning rise in defiant behavior in the holding area.
responseMinorC18.button=Allow it
responseMinorC18.tooltip=Sometimes letting them keep small comforts prevents bigger problems.
responseMinorC18.success=%s, allowing the prisoners to keep the leaflets seems to have defused\
  \ tension. Guards report that while the materials are circulating, they're mostly being used as\
  \ morale boosters rather than anything subversive. The holding area remains calm, and order is\
  \ intact.
responseMinorC18.failure=%s, allowing the leaflets to circulate was a mistake. The prisoners are\
  \ now rallying around the propaganda, using it to organize and spread anti-authority sentiments.\
  \ Guards are struggling to contain the growing unrest, and the situation in the holding area is\
  \ becoming volatile.

eventMinor19.message=%s, the prisoners have started singing old war songs, loudly and in unison. We're\

responseMinorB19.button=Let it continue
responseMinorB19.tooltip=It's just music - what harm could it do?
responseMinorB19.success=%s, allowing the singing to continue seems to have had a positive effect.\
  \ The prisoners are calmer, and the unity displayed appears to be limited to boosting morale\
  \ rather than anything subversive. The holding area remains stable for now.
responseMinorB19.failure=%s, letting the singing continue was a mistake. It has emboldened the\
  \ prisoners, who are now treating it as a form of defiance. Guards are reporting an increase in\
  \ coordinated behavior and suspect the songs are being used to send covert signals. The holding\
  \ area is becoming more tense.
responseMinorC19.button=Use it for intel
responseMinorC19.tooltip=Record the lyrics to see if they include hidden messages.
responseMinorC19.success=%s, recording and analyzing the lyrics revealed a mix of nostalgic war\
  \ anthems and veiled references to past battles. Guards identified a subtle code within the\
  \ songs, allowing us to uncover a minor plot before it could be executed. The situation has been\
  \ diffused, and order remains intact.
responseMinorC19.failure=%s, attempts to analyze the songs yielded no actionable intel. Meanwhile,\

responseMinorA20.button=Ignore it
responseMinorA20.tooltip=They'll eat when they're hungry enough.
responseMinorA20.success=%s, ignoring the refusal to eat proved effective. After a few days, the\
  \ protesting prisoners gave up and resumed eating with no further incident. Guards report that\
  \ the rest of the population has remained calm, and the situation is back to normal.
responseMinorA20.failure=%s, ignoring the protest backfired. The hunger strike gained traction\

  \ Tensions in the holding area are rising, and guards are struggling to maintain control.
responseMinorB20.button=Negotiate
responseMinorB20.tooltip=Speak to the ringleader and see what they want.
responseMinorB20.success=%s, speaking with the ringleader revealed the root of their complaints.\
  \ Minor adjustments to rations and living conditions were enough to defuse the situation, and the\
  \ prisoners have resumed eating. The holding area is calm, and guards report no further unrest.
responseMinorB20.failure=%s, the negotiation attempt failed. The ringleader used the opportunity to\
  \ rally more prisoners to their cause, turning a small protest into a larger movement. Guards are\
  \ now dealing with increased defiance, and the holding area is becoming more volatile.
responseMinorC20.button=Force-feed them
responseMinorC20.tooltip=Demonstrate that resistance won't work here.
responseMinorC20.success=%s, the guards demonstrated clear authority, and the prisoners' resistance\
  \ quickly crumbled. While the act of force-feeding them was unpleasant, it sent a strong message\
  \ that defiance wouldn't be tolerated. The rest of the population has remained compliant, and the\
  \ holding area is stable.
responseMinorC20.failure=%s, force-feeding the prisoners enraged the population. The act was seen\

  \ deteriorating rapidly.

eventMinor21.message=%s, one of my guards overheard prisoners talking about "the perfect time" to make\
  \ a break for it. While it might just be idle chatter, it's enough to make the team uneasy. We've\

  \ stepping up security measures. Let us know how you'd like to proceed.
responseMinorA21.button=Tighten security
responseMinorA21.tooltip=Increase patrols and inspections.
responseMinorA21.success=%s, increasing patrols and inspections proved effective. Guards discovered\
  \ and confiscated makeshift tools hidden among the prisoners' belongings, possibly intended for\
  \ an escape attempt. The heightened security has deterred further planning, and the holding area\
  \ is secure.
responseMinorA21.failure=%s, tightening security agitated the prisoners, who view the increased\

  \ significantly in the holding area. Guards report that the prisoners are growing more defiant.
responseMinorB21.button=Interrogate the leaders
responseMinorB21.tooltip=Find out who's behind the whispers.
responseMinorB21.success=%s, interrogating the suspected leaders revealed valuable intelligence. It\
  \ appears the prisoners were testing the guards' reactions and probing for weak spots. The\
  \ ringleaders have been isolated, and the guards are now better prepared to prevent any attempts\
  \ at escape.
responseMinorB21.failure=%s, the interrogation yielded no actionable information, but it caused\
  \ significant unrest among the prisoners. Many are now openly accusing the guards of unfair\
  \ treatment, and tensions in the holding area are escalating rapidly.
responseMinorC21.button=Ignore it
responseMinorC21.tooltip=Idle talk doesn't mean a real threat.
responseMinorC21.success=%s, ignoring the chatter turned out to be the right decision. The talk of\
  \ a breakout was just idle banter, and the prisoners eventually moved on to other distractions.\
  \ Guards report no signs of unusual activity, and the holding area remains calm.
responseMinorC21.failure=%s, ignoring the chatter was a mistake. A coordinated escape attempt was\
  \ uncovered too late, and while the prisoners were caught before breaking out, the breach has\
  \ shaken the guards' confidence. The holding area is now unstable, and tensions are at an\
  \ all-time high.

eventMinor22.message=%s, a piece of surveillance equipment in the holding area has been found damaged.\
  \ The prisoners are claiming it broke on its own, but we're not convinced - it looks\

responseMinorA22.button=Investigate thoroughly
responseMinorA22.tooltip=Determine if sabotage is to blame.
responseMinorA22.success=%s, a thorough investigation revealed evidence of deliberate tampering.\
  \ Reviewing the footage pinpointed the prisoner responsible, who has been isolated and\
  \ disciplined. Guards have increased their vigilance, and the holding area remains secure.
responseMinorA22.failure=%s, despite the investigation, we found no definitive proof of sabotage.\
  \ The lack of results has only emboldened the prisoners, and guards report increased defiance in\

responseMinorB22.button=Repair it and move on
responseMinorB22.tooltip=It's not worth the resources to dig into this.
responseMinorB22.success=%s, the decision to repair the equipment without further action seems to\
  \ have paid off. Guards report no further tampering, and the situation in the holding area\
  \ remains calm. It appears this was an isolated incident.
responseMinorB22.failure=%s, ignoring the incident has backfired. The prisoners have started\

  \ scrambling to address multiple points of sabotage, and tensions are escalating.
responseMinorC22.button=Punish them all
responseMinorC22.tooltip=Make the prisoners understand sabotage will not be tolerated.
responseMinorC22.success=%s, the collective punishment sent a clear message. The prisoners are\
  \ subdued, and guards report no further incidents of tampering. The holding area is tense, but\
  \ order has been maintained for now.
responseMinorC22.failure=%s, punishing the entire population has caused significant unrest. The\

eventMinor23.message=%s, one of the prisoners is claiming the enemy is planning a rescue operation. This\

responseMinorA23.button=Call their bluff
responseMinorA23.tooltip=Announce that no rescue is coming and spread doubt.
responseMinorA23.success=%s, announcing that no rescue was coming successfully sowed doubt among\
  \ the prisoners. The ringleader's claims have been largely dismissed by the population, and the\
  \ overall mood has stabilized. Guards report no further disruptions, and order has been\
  \ maintained.
responseMinorA23.failure=%s, calling their bluff backfired. The prisoners interpreted the\

  \ coordination among the prisoners.
responseMinorB23.button=Interrogate the officer
responseMinorB23.tooltip=Find out if there's any truth to the claim.
responseMinorB23.success=%s, interrogating the prisoner revealed the claim to be baseless. The\
  \ officer admitted to fabricating the story to raise morale among their comrades. The guards\
  \ have since discredited the claim among the prisoners, and the holding area is calm once again.
responseMinorB23.failure=%s, the interrogation yielded no clear answers, but it further emboldened\
  \ the prisoners. They now view the officer as a symbol of resistance, rallying behind their\
  \ defiance. Guards are reporting a noticeable rise in unrest throughout the holding area.
responseMinorC23.button=Prepare defenses
responseMinorC23.tooltip=Just in case, increase security in key areas.
responseMinorC23.success=%s, reinforcing security measures proved prudent. While no rescue attempt\
  \ materialized, the show of force has deterred further defiance among the prisoners. Guards\
  \ report that the population is more subdued, and the holding area is secure.
responseMinorC23.failure=%s, increasing security measures had the unintended effect of validating\

responseMinorA24.button=Hold them anyway
responseMinorA24.tooltip=You can't take any chances - they stay with the others.
responseMinorA24.success=%s, the decision to hold the prisoner has prevented potential security\

responseMinorB24.button=Investigate their claim
responseMinorB24.tooltip=Assign someone to verify their story, if possible.
responseMinorB24.success=%s, the investigation confirmed the prisoner's story - they are indeed a\

responseMinorC24.button=Move them to better quarters
responseMinorC24.tooltip=You can't risk freeing them.
responseMinorC24.success=%s, moving the prisoner to better quarters seems to have defused the\
  \ immediate tension. The other prisoners took note of the gesture, and the holding area remains\
  \ calm. Guards report no further issues, though the situation is being monitored closely.
responseMinorC24.failure=%s, moving the prisoner caused significant backlash. The rest of the\

responseMinorA25.button=Decode it
responseMinorA25.tooltip=Assign a specialist to figure out what it says.
responseMinorA25.success=%s, the code was successfully cracked, revealing plans for a coordinated\

responseMinorA25.failure=%s, despite our best efforts, the code couldn't be cracked in time. The\
  \ contents remain a mystery, and tensions are rising as the other prisoners sense increased guard\
  \ activity. This may have emboldened the population, and the situation remains unstable.
responseMinorB25.button=Burn it
responseMinorB25.tooltip=Eliminate the letter without risking the contents getting out.
responseMinorB25.success=%s, the letter was destroyed immediately, ensuring its contents won't\
  \ reach the intended recipient. While the prisoner expressed frustration, no further incidents\
  \ have occurred. The holding area remains under control, and the risk of external coordination\

  \ the prisoners.
responseMinorC25.button=Deliver it
responseMinorC25.tooltip=Send it to the intended recipient to see what happens.
responseMinorC25.success=%s, delivering the letter led to an unexpected breakthrough. By monitoring\

  \ information, we've taken measures to neutralize the threat. The holding area remains stable.
responseMinorC25.failure=%s, delivering the letter turned out to be a major risk. The recipient was\

responseMinorB26.button=Call their bluff
responseMinorB26.tooltip=Assume it's a ploy and take no action.
responseMinorB26.success=%s, assuming it was a ploy proved correct. The prisoners eventually\
  \ admitted to faking the symptoms in an attempt to gain better treatment. Guards report that the\

responseMinorC26.button=Bring in medical support
responseMinorC26.tooltip=Treat the prisoners to ensure safety.

eventMinor27.message=%s, one of the prisoners just handed me a folded piece of paper shaped like a\
  \ unicorn. It appears harmless, but the gesture feels oddly symbolic, and we're unsure how\

  \ creativity. We'll keep an eye on the prisoner for any further behavior, but let us know if you\
  \ want us to take any specific actions.
responseMinorA27.button=Destroy it
responseMinorA27.tooltip=It's just paper, but better safe than sorry.
responseMinorA27.success=%s, the paper unicorn was destroyed without incident. While the prisoner\

responseMinorB27.tooltip=Speak to the prisoner and understand their intentions.
responseMinorB27.success=%s, speaking with the prisoner revealed the unicorn was simply a gesture of\
  \ peace and creativity. The explanation eased any concerns, and the interaction seemed to foster\
  \ a sense of calm among the prisoners. The holding area is stable, and no further incidents have\
  \ occurred.
responseMinorB27.failure=%s, the prisoner refused to explain the unicorn's meaning, claiming, "You'll\
  \ understand in time." This cryptic response has unnerved the guards and sparked rumors among the\
  \ prisoners. Tensions in the holding area are rising, and the situation feels increasingly\
  \ uneasy.
responseMinorC27.button=Keep it as a curiosity
responseMinorC27.tooltip=Add it to your collection of oddities.
responseMinorC27.success=%s, the paper unicorn was added to your collection of oddities, and the\
  \ prisoner seemed pleased that their creation was appreciated. Guards report that the gesture has\
  \ had a calming effect on the holding area, and the other prisoners appear less agitated.
responseMinorC27.failure=%s, keeping the paper unicorn as a curiosity has caused unease among the\
  \ prisoners. Many believe it's being analyzed for hidden meaning, and the prisoner who made it\
  \ has become oddly withdrawn. The holding area feels tense, and guards are reporting subtle\
  \ shifts in behavior.

eventMinor28.message=%s, the other guards have reported hearing strange metallic noises coming from the\
  \ holding area during the night. We haven't identified the source yet, but it's unusual enough to\

responseMinorA28.button=Inspect the cells
responseMinorA28.tooltip=Search thoroughly for contraband or escape attempts.

responseMinorA28.failure=%s, the inspection turned up nothing unusual, but the process caused\

  \ holding area have increased. Guards report more hostility from the population.
responseMinorB28.button=Ignore it
responseMinorB28.tooltip=It's probably just the old ventilation system.
responseMinorB28.success=%s, ignoring the noises proved to be the right call. The sound was traced\
  \ to an aging ventilation duct, which has since stopped making noise. Guards report that the\
  \ holding area is calm, and no further incidents have occurred.
responseMinorB28.failure=%s, ignoring the noises was a mistake. A hidden escape tunnel was\
  \ discovered too late, and several prisoners were caught trying to break through. While the\
  \ attempt was thwarted, the incident has shaken the guards' confidence, and tensions are rising\
  \ in the holding area.
responseMinorC28.button=Set a trap
responseMinorC28.tooltip=Use the noise to lure out whoever is causing it.
responseMinorC28.success=%s, the guards set a trap, quietly monitoring the source of the noises.\
  \ They successfully caught two prisoners tampering with a vent during the night. The prisoners\
  \ have been isolated, and their tools confiscated. The holding area is stable, and no further\
  \ incidents have been reported.
responseMinorC28.failure=%s, the attempt to set a trap failed. Whoever was causing the noises\
  \ appears to have caught on and stopped before revealing themselves. Guards are left uneasy, and\
  \ the holding area is tense with rumors of an organized plot among the prisoners.

eventMinor29.message=%s, one of the prisoners is growing increasingly agitated, insisting that someone\
  \ on our crew is spying on them. While there's no evidence to support their claim, their paranoia\

  \ monitoring the prisoner closely and deciding whether to confront or attempt to calm them down.\
  \ Let us know how you'd like to proceed.
responseMinorA29.button=Humor them
responseMinorA29.tooltip=Assign a guard to reassure the prisoner.
responseMinorA29.success=%s, isolating the prisoner successfully prevented their paranoia from\
  \ spreading. While they remain agitated, the rest of the holding area is calm, and guards report\
  \ no further disruptions. The situation is under control for now.
responseMinorA29.failure=%s, isolating the prisoner caused unrest among the population. Other\

responseMinorC29.button=Ignore their claims
responseMinorC29.tooltip=Paranoia is just a side effect of captivity.
responseMinorC29.success=%s, ignoring the prisoner's claims allowed the situation to resolve\
  \ itself. Over time, their paranoia subsided, and the other prisoners have largely dismissed\
  \ their outbursts. Guards report no further disruptions, and the holding area is calm.
responseMinorC29.failure=%s, ignoring the prisoner's paranoia was a mistake. Their disruptive\

  \ Recommend conducting a full sweep of the facility and interrogating key prisoners to uncover\
  \ the extent of the plan. Awaiting your orders.
responseMinorA30.button=Collapse the tunnel
responseMinorA30.tooltip=Seal it up and monitor the area.
responseMinorA30.success=%s, the tunnel was collapsed and sealed off, sending a clear message to\
  \ the prisoners. Guards have been stationed in the area to ensure no further digging occurs. The\
  \ holding area remains secure, and no additional escape attempts have been reported.
responseMinorA30.failure=%s, collapsing the tunnel angered the prisoners. They saw it as a\

  \ subdued. Guards report no further signs of coordination, and the holding area is stable.
responseMinorB30.failure=%s, the interrogations yielded no useful information, but they have\
  \ significantly agitated the prisoners. Accusations of harassment are spreading, and tensions in\

responseMinorC30.button=Leave it open
responseMinorC30.tooltip=Use it as bait to catch escapees in the act.
responseMinorC30.success=%s, leaving the tunnel open allowed guards to catch the diggers in the\
  \ act during the night. The prisoners involved were detained, and their tools confiscated. The\
  \ holding area is now secure, and guards are closely monitoring the situation.
responseMinorC30.failure=%s, leaving the tunnel open backfired. The prisoners outmaneuvered the\
  \ guards and used the tunnel to attempt an escape. While they were eventually stopped, the\

  \ dangerously high.

eventMinor31.message=%s, one of the prisoners appears to have tamed a small rodent that's been\

  \ now.
responseMinorA31.failure=%s, allowing the rodent proved to be a mistake. Guards later discovered\

  \ the smuggled items.
responseMinorB31.button=Confiscate the animal
responseMinorB31.tooltip=The prisoners can't have unauthorized "pets."
responseMinorB31.success=%s, the rodent was removed without incident. While the prisoner was\
  \ clearly upset, the rest of the population seems indifferent, and guards report no further\
  \ issues. The holding area remains secure, and morale has stabilized.
responseMinorB31.failure=%s, confiscating the rodent caused unexpected backlash. The prisoners\
  \ viewed the act as unnecessarily cruel, and tensions in the holding area have increased. Guards\
  \ are now dealing with minor disturbances and defiant behavior.
responseMinorC31.button=Set traps
responseMinorC31.tooltip=Get rid of all vermin for good.
responseMinorC31.success=%s, setting traps eliminated the rodent problem entirely. Guards report no\
  \ further sightings of vermin, and the holding area remains secure. While some prisoners grumbled\
  \ about the decision, the overall mood has stabilized, and no further issues have arisen.
responseMinorC31.failure=%s, setting traps caused significant unrest among the prisoners, who\

  \ defiant, and guards report increased tension in the holding area.

eventMinor32.message=%s, we've just discovered rope-like contraband fashioned from torn uniforms hidden\
  \ in the holding area. It's unclear how long it's been in the works or what the prisoners were\

  \ received loud and clear. Guards report that the holding area has grown quieter, and no further\
  \ contraband has been discovered during follow-up inspections. The situation is under control.
responseMinorA32.failure=%s, punishing the prisoners caused widespread backlash. The rest of the\

responseMinorB32.button=Confiscate it quietly
responseMinorB32.tooltip=Avoid stirring up unrest.
responseMinorB32.success=%s, the rope-like contraband was confiscated quietly, avoiding unnecessary\
  \ attention. Guards have increased patrols and monitoring, and no further suspicious behavior has\
  \ been observed. The holding area remains stable, and morale is unaffected.
responseMinorB32.failure=%s, confiscating the contraband quietly wasn't enough. The prisoners\

  \ increasing.
responseMinorC32.button=Reward the guard
responseMinorC32.tooltip=Praise them for catching the attempt early.

responseMinorA33.button=Verify their claim
responseMinorA33.tooltip=Check their story against your records.
responseMinorA33.success=%s, verification through Command confirmed the prisoner's identity as an\

responseMinorB33.button=Dismiss them
responseMinorB33.tooltip=It's probably just a ploy for better treatment.
responseMinorB33.success=%s, dismissing the prisoner's claims seems to have defused the situation.\
  \ They've stopped insisting on their supposed status, and the other prisoners appear to view it\
  \ as a failed attempt at manipulation. Guards report that the holding area remains stable.
responseMinorB33.failure=%s, dismissing the claim backfired. The prisoner has doubled down,\

responseMinorC33.button=Put them to the test.
responseMinorC33.tooltip=See if they have actionable intel.
responseMinorC33.success=%s, the prisoner provided actionable intel as a way to prove their\

responseMinorA34.button=Investigate
responseMinorA34.tooltip=Who branded them, and why?
responseMinorA34.success=%s, the investigation revealed that the scar was self-inflicted as a show\

responseMinorC34.button=Ignore it
responseMinorC34.tooltip=Let the prisoners handle their own business.
responseMinorC34.success=%s, ignoring the incident has allowed the situation to settle naturally.\
  \ While the branding initially caused a stir, the other prisoners lost interest over time, and\

responseMinorC34.failure=%s, ignoring the branding was a mistake. The prisoner has gained\

eventMinor35.message=%s, there's been an eerie and unusual silence coming from the prisoners' holding\

responseMinorA35.button=Check on them
responseMinorA35.tooltip=Ensure everything is in order.
responseMinorA35.success=%s, a quick inspection revealed no immediate issues. The prisoners appear\

responseMinorB35.tooltip=Silence is better than trouble.
responseMinorB35.success=%s, leaving the prisoners undisturbed seems to have been the right call.\
  \ The silence persisted for a while before normal activity resumed. Guards report no unusual\

responseMinorC35.button=Set up surveillance
responseMinorC35.tooltip=Keep an eye on the situation from a distance.
responseMinorC35.success=%s, surveillance confirmed the prisoners were simply resting or\

responseMinorA36.button=Encourage it
responseMinorA36.tooltip=Cooperation might keep things calm.
responseMinorA36.success=%s, allowing the singing to continue seems to have had a calming effect on\

responseMinorC37.button=Let it be
responseMinorC37.tooltip=It's probably meaningless.
responseMinorC37.success=%s, choosing not to act seems to have been the right decision. The symbols\
  \ turned out to be nothing more than an artistic expression, and the prisoners have moved on to\
  \ other distractions. The holding area remains stable, and no signs of unrest have emerged.
responseMinorC37.failure=%s, ignoring the paper was a mistake. Guards later discovered that the\
  \ symbols were part of a larger coordination effort, and by the time it was uncovered, some\

  \ measures are being taken.

eventMinor38.message=%s, the prisoners appear to be celebrating a holiday, using improvised decorations\

responseMinorA38.button=Shut it down
responseMinorA38.tooltip=No celebrations in captivity.
responseMinorA38.success=%s, the celebrations were shut down swiftly and without incident. While\

  \ calm, and the population appears subdued for now.
responseMinorA38.failure=%s, shutting down the holiday celebrations caused significant backlash.\
  \ The prisoners saw this as an unnecessary act of oppression, and tensions in the holding area\
  \ have increased sharply. Guards are now dealing with more frequent defiance from the population.
responseMinorB38.button=Allow it
responseMinorB38.tooltip=A little morale boost won't hurt.
responseMinorB38.success=%s, allowing the celebrations to continue had a surprisingly positive\
  \ effect. The festive atmosphere seems to have improved morale among the prisoners, and guards\
  \ report a more relaxed and cooperative mood in the holding area. No signs of unrest have been\
  \ observed.
responseMinorB38.failure=%s, allowing the celebrations emboldened the prisoners. The cohesion\

  \ reporting subtle signs of increased defiance. The holding area is growing more volatile.
responseMinorC38.button=Exploit it
responseMinorC38.tooltip=Use the celebration to extract information.
responseMinorC38.success=%s, using the celebrations to gather intel proved effective. Guards were\
  \ able to mingle and discreetly extract information about the prisoners' plans and alliances. The\
  \ holding area remains calm, and the insights gained will strengthen overall security.
responseMinorC38.failure=%s, attempting to exploit the celebrations was seen as intrusive by the\
  \ prisoners. They quickly grew suspicious of the guards' presence, and the festive atmosphere\
  \ turned tense. Guards report increased hostility, and the holding area feels more unstable.

eventMinor39.message=%s, we've noticed two prisoners frequently whispering to each other in the holding\
  \ area. While we don't have details on what they're discussing, their behavior is drawing\

responseMinorA39.button=Break them up
responseMinorA39.tooltip=Separate them before it turns into a problem.
responseMinorA39.success=%s, the prisoners were separated without incident. Guards report that\
  \ their behavior has returned to normal, and the rest of the holding area remains calm. Whatever\

  \ are now attempting to rally support from their peers, making the situation more volatile.
responseMinorB39.button=Eavesdrop
responseMinorB39.tooltip=Try to learn what they're planning.
responseMinorB39.success=%s, eavesdropping on the prisoners revealed discussions of an escape plan.\
  \ Guards intervened before the plan could be set in motion, and the prisoners involved have been\
  \ isolated. The holding area remains secure, and morale among the staff has improved with this\
  \ proactive action.
responseMinorB39.failure=%s, the attempt to eavesdrop was detected, and the prisoners immediately\
  \ stopped talking. Their suspicion has spread to the rest of the population, increasing paranoia\
  \ and hostility. Guards report heightened tension in the holding area as a result.
responseMinorC39.button=Let it go
responseMinorC39.tooltip=Alliances sometimes form under strange circumstances.
responseMinorC39.success=%s, ignoring the whispers turned out to be the right choice. The prisoners\
  \ were simply discussing personal matters, and their behavior has since normalized. Guards report\
  \ no signs of coordinated activity, and the holding area remains calm.
responseMinorC39.failure=%s, letting the situation go unchecked backfired. The two prisoners were\
  \ coordinating an effort to disrupt operations, and their plans are now in motion. Guards are\
  \ scrambling to contain the situation, and the holding area is growing increasingly unstable.

eventMinor40.message=%s, one of the prisoners appears to have significant influence over the others,\
  \ despite speaking very little. Their presence alone seems to command respect or compliance,\

  \ disruptive. Let us know your orders.
responseMinorA40.button=Interrogate them
responseMinorA40.tooltip=Find out what makes them so respected.
responseMinorA40.success=%s, the interrogation revealed that the prisoner's influence stems from\
  \ their leadership during previous campaigns. The guards were able to glean valuable information\
  \ about the prisoner's background and potential plans, and their influence has diminished after\
  \ being publicly questioned. The holding area remains calm.
responseMinorA40.failure=%s, the interrogation backfired. The prisoner refused to cooperate, and\
  \ their defiance only strengthened their standing among the others. Guards report increased\
  \ solidarity among the prisoners, and tensions in the holding area are rising.
responseMinorB40.button=Isolate them
responseMinorB40.tooltip=Remove them to weaken their influence.
responseMinorB40.success=%s, isolating the influential prisoner successfully disrupted their sway\
  \ over the others. Without their presence, the prisoners seem disorganized and less defiant.\
  \ Guards report a noticeable decrease in tension, and the holding area remains secure.
responseMinorB40.failure=%s, isolating the prisoner caused significant unrest. The other prisoners\
  \ now view them as a martyr, and their influence has grown even in isolation. Guards report\
  \ heightened defiance and a growing sense of unity among the population.
responseMinorC40.button=Observe quietly
responseMinorC40.tooltip=See how the dynamic develops.
responseMinorC40.success=%s, quiet observation revealed no immediate signs of disruption. The\
  \ prisoner's influence seems passive rather than active, and guards have been able to\
  \ maintain order without interference. The holding area remains stable, and the situation is under control.
responseMinorC40.failure=%s, observing quietly allowed the prisoner to consolidate their influence\
  \ further. Guards are now reporting subtle but coordinated actions among the prisoners,\

eventMinor41.message=%s, two of my guards have been openly arguing over how to handle the prisoners.\

responseMinorA41.button=Mediate the argument
responseMinorA41.tooltip=Resolve the issue diplomatically.
responseMinorA41.success=%s, mediating the argument allowed both guards to express their\
  \ perspectives and find common ground. The discussion ended on a positive note, and team morale\
  \ has noticeably improved. Guards are working more cohesively, and the holding area remains\
  \ secure.
responseMinorA41.failure=%s, the mediation attempt failed. Neither guard was willing to back down,\

responseMinorB41.button=Reassign one of them
responseMinorB41.tooltip=End the feud by separating them.
responseMinorB41.success=%s, reassigning one of the guards effectively ended the feud. Both\
  \ individuals seem more focused in their new roles, and the rest of the team has returned to\
  \ normal operations. Morale is stable, and the holding area remains secure.
responseMinorB41.failure=%s, reassigning one of the guards created resentment. The reassigned\

  \ Morale has dropped, and cohesion among the guards has been compromised.
responseMinorC41.button=Let them sort it out
responseMinorC41.tooltip=It's not your job to babysit.
responseMinorC41.success=%s, allowing the guards to resolve their dispute on their own proved\
  \ effective. They reached an understanding after a heated discussion, and the team is back on\
  \ track. Morale has stabilized, and operations in the holding area continue without issue.
responseMinorC41.failure=%s, leaving the guards to sort it out only worsened the situation. Their\
  \ feud has escalated into open hostility, and the team is now divided. The holding area is less\
  \ secure, and guards are distracted from their duties, creating a potential risk.

eventMinor42.message=%s, one of the prisoners is pleading for the return of a small, personal item that\

responseMinorA42.button=Return it
responseMinorA42.tooltip=Allow them to keep the sentimental item.
responseMinorA42.success=%s, the item was returned to the prisoner after ensuring it posed no\
  \ security risk. The gesture seems to have eased tensions in the holding area, and the other\
  \ prisoners appear less agitated. Guards report improved morale among the population, and the\

responseMinorA42.failure=%s, returning the item was a mistake. It was later discovered that the\

  \ scrambling to contain the fallout, and tensions in the holding area have risen sharply.
responseMinorB42.button=Deny the request
responseMinorB42.tooltip=Personal items could be used for manipulation.
responseMinorB42.success=%s, denying the request sent a clear message that security protocols would\
  \ not be compromised. While the prisoner seemed upset, the rest of the population appears\
  \ indifferent, and no further similar requests have been made. The holding area remains secure.
responseMinorB42.failure=%s, denying the request caused unrest among the prisoners, who now view\
  \ the decision as unnecessarily cruel. Guards report increased hostility and subtle signs of\
  \ defiance in the holding area, making the situation more volatile.
responseMinorC42.button=Investigate the item
responseMinorC42.tooltip=Ensure it's not more than it seems.
responseMinorC42.success=%s, the item was thoroughly inspected and confirmed to be harmless.\
  \ Returning it to the prisoner eased tensions without compromising security. Guards report that\
  \ the holding area remains calm, and the population is more cooperative overall.
responseMinorC42.failure=%s, the investigation revealed that the item contained a concealed\

responseMinorA43.button=Punish the thief
responseMinorA43.tooltip=Send a clear message that such cruelty won't be tolerated.
responseMinorA43.success=%s, punishing the thief sent a clear message that such behavior wouldn't\

  \ restored in the holding area. The malnourished prisoner is receiving medical attention and is\
  \ expected to recover.
responseMinorA43.failure=%s, punishing the thief backfired. The other prisoners viewed it as\

eventMinor44.message=%s, a prisoner was found with severe injuries, including broken ribs and a swollen\

  \ for both guards and prisoners.
responseMinorC44.button=Strengthen patrols
responseMinorC44.tooltip=Increase guard presence to prevent further violence.
responseMinorC44.success=%s, increasing guard patrols has had a calming effect on the prisoners.\

responseMajorC0.button=Cut your losses
responseMajorC0.tooltip=Focus on containing the remaining prisoners while letting some escape.
responseMajorC0.success=%s, cutting our losses allowed us to focus on securing the remaining\
  \ prisoners and minimizing casualties. While some prisoners escaped, the breach has been\
  \ repaired, and the facility is stable. The guards are regrouping, and the remaining population\
  \ has been subdued.
responseMajorC0.failure=%s, cutting our losses only emboldened the prisoners. While we secured the\
  \ remaining population, the number of escapees was higher than expected. The facility is intact,\
  \ but morale among the guards has plummeted, and tensions are high among the remaining prisoners.\
  \ Stability is fragile at best.

eventMajor1.message=%s, the prisoners have erupted into a full-scale riot! They've armed themselves\
  \ with makeshift weapons - pipes, sharp tools, even shards of metal ripped from the holding area.\
  \ We've fallen back to the control room. The barricades won't hold for long, and they're trying\
  \ to force their way in! We need backup and orders immediately, or we're going to lose control\
  \ of the entire facility!
responseMajorA1.button=Deploy riot suppression teams
responseMajorA1.tooltip=Use stun weapons and tear gas to bring the prisoners under control.
responseMajorA1.success=%s, the riot suppression teams successfully subdued the prisoners. Stun\
  \ weapons and tear gas brought the situation under control, and all hostiles have been\
  \ restrained. There were minor injuries on both sides, but no major casualties. The facility is\
  \ secure, and order has been fully restored.
responseMajorA1.failure=%s, the riot suppression teams were overwhelmed. The prisoners resisted\
  \ tear gas and makeshift barricades, overrunning critical areas before retreating guards could\
  \ regroup. Several guards sustained injuries, and the holding area has suffered significant\
  \ damage. The riot has been quelled, but the aftermath will require a full assessment.
responseMajorB1.button=Call in reinforcements
responseMajorB1.tooltip=Deploy combat units to decisively end the riot, even if it means\
  \ significant bloodshed.
responseMajorB1.success=%s, reinforcements successfully ended the riot. The combat units acted\
  \ decisively, overpowering the prisoners and restoring full control of the facility. There were\
  \ some injuries among the prisoners, including a few severe cases, but the situation is resolved,\
  \ and the facility is secure once more.
responseMajorB1.failure=%s, reinforcements engaged the prisoners, but the riot escalated further\
  \ before it could be stopped. Heavy fighting caused significant damage to the facility, and\
  \ multiple injuries were reported on both sides. While control has been regained, the cost was\
  \ high, and parts of the compound are heavily compromised.
responseMajorC1.button=Offer terms of surrender
responseMajorC1.tooltip=Promise improved conditions to quell the violence, knowing it might\
  \ embolden the prisoners later.
responseMajorC1.success=%s, the prisoners accepted the terms of surrender, and the riot has been\
  \ defused. They disarmed and returned to their cells after receiving assurances of improved\
  \ conditions. While the situation is under control, tensions in the facility remain high, and the\
  \ guards are on edge following the incident.
responseMajorC1.failure=%s, the prisoners rejected the terms of surrender and escalated their\
  \ assault before the riot was finally subdued. They seized additional sections of the facility\
  \ and inflicted serious damage before eventually being overpowered. While the immediate threat\
  \ has passed, the holding area is left in disarray.

eventMajor2.message=%s, we've found a well-liked prisoner dead in their cell - murdered! There's a\
  \ note pinned to their chest claiming responsibility. The other prisoners are furious, and\
  \ they're blaming us for letting this happen. They're threatening revenge unless the killer is\
  \ identified immediately! Tensions are about to explode - we need instructions on how to defuse\
  \ this before it turns into a bloodbath!
responseMajorA2.button=Launch a full investigation
responseMajorA2.tooltip=Dedicate resources to finding the murderer and addressing prisoner grievances.
responseMajorA2.success=%s, the investigation was a success. The murderer was identified and taken\
  \ into custody, and the other prisoners are satisfied that justice has been served. While\
  \ tensions remain, the swift and thorough response has calmed the situation. The facility is\
  \ stable, and order has been restored.
responseMajorA2.failure=%s, the investigation failed to uncover the murderer. Despite our efforts,\
  \ the lack of results has only fueled prisoner anger, and their distrust in us has deepened.\
  \ While the immediate violence has subsided, tensions remain dangerously high, and the prisoners\
  \ are still on edge.
responseMajorB2.button=Blame a scapegoat
responseMajorB2.tooltip=Pin the murder on a convenient suspect to restore order quickly, even if\
  \ they're innocent.
responseMajorB2.success=%s, a convenient suspect was blamed for the murder, and the prisoners\
  \ accepted the explanation. The scapegoat was removed from the population, and tensions have\
  \ eased significantly. While the situation is now under control, some guards have voiced concerns\
  \ about the ethics of this decision.
responseMajorB2.failure=%s, the attempt to blame a scapegoat backfired. The prisoners saw through\
  \ the ruse and are more furious than ever. They believe we're hiding the real murderer, and their\
  \ demands for justice have escalated. Order has been restored for now, but the unrest is far\
  \ from over.
responseMajorC2.button=Punish the rest
responseMajorC2.tooltip=Crack down hard on the other prisoners, regardless of whether they were involved.
responseMajorC2.success=%s, a harsh crackdown on the prisoners has restored order. While many of\
  \ them are bitter about the collective punishment, the display of authority has subdued any\
  \ immediate threats. The facility is secure, though tensions remain beneath the surface.
responseMajorC2.failure=%s, the crackdown sparked even more chaos. The prisoners resisted fiercely,\
  \ resulting in widespread injuries and significant damage to the facility. While the riot has\
  \ been quelled, the cost was high, and the population is now even more defiant. Order has been\
  \ restored, but the situation remains volatile.

eventMajor3.message=%s, a fire has broken out in one of the prisoner cellblocks! We're\
  \ scrambling to respond, but with limited personnel, we're struggling to contain the blaze.\
  \ Prisoners are screaming for help as the flames spread - some are trying to break free in the\
  \ chaos, while others are turning on each other to survive. The cause of the fire is still\
  \ unclear - could be an accident or sabotage. We need immediate orders on how to\
  \ prioritize containment, rescues, and security!
responseMajorA3.button=Save as many as possible
responseMajorA3.tooltip=Focus your efforts on rescuing prisoners and guards, even if it means\
  \ losing critical resources or risking a breakout.
responseMajorA3.success=%s, we prioritized rescues, and many prisoners and guards were saved from\
  \ the blaze. Though we lost some critical resources and sustained damage to the facility, the\
  \ majority of lives were spared. The fire has been extinguished, and order is being\
  \ reestablished. While the situation was costly, the effort has restored some trust among the\
  \ prisoners.
responseMajorA3.failure=%s, espite our best efforts to rescue as many as possible, the fire spread\
  \ too quickly. Several prisoners and guards couldn't be saved, and critical resources were\
  \ destroyed in the chaos. While the blaze is now extinguished, the loss of life and damage to the\
  \ facility have left morale in shambles.
responseMajorB3.button=Secure the perimeter
responseMajorB3.tooltip=Lock down the camp to prevent any escape attempts, even if it means\
  \ sacrificing lives in the cellblock.
responseMajorB3.success=%s, the perimeter has been secured, and no prisoners managed to escape\
  \ during the chaos. While several prisoners perished in the fire, the facility remains intact,\
  \ and critical infrastructure has been preserved. Order has been restored, but the loss of life\
  \ has heightened tensions within the population.
responseMajorB3.failure=%s, we locked down the perimeter, but the decision came at a heavy cost.\
  \ Many prisoners and even some guards succumbed to the fire while we focused on security, and\
  \ critical parts of the facility were severely damaged. While no one escaped, the backlash among\
  \ the surviving prisoners is intense, and trust in our leadership has eroded.
responseMajorC3.button=Investigate first
responseMajorC3.tooltip=Prioritize finding the source of the fire - sabotage could indicate a\
  \ larger conspiracy among the prisoners.
responseMajorC3.success=%s, we prioritized investigating the fire and uncovered evidence of\
  \ deliberate sabotage by a faction of prisoners. While the delay in response meant more lives and\
  \ resources were lost, the discovery of this plot has allowed us to identify key culprits and\
  \ prevent future incidents. The fire is extinguished, and the perpetrators have been detained.
responseMajorC3.failure=%s, the investigation delayed our response to the fire, resulting in\
  \ significant loss of life and damage to the facility. To make matters worse, we found no\
  \ conclusive evidence of sabotage, and the cause of the fire remains uncertain. The surviving\
  \ prisoners are furious, and the facility is in disarray. This failure has only added fuel to the\
  \ unrest.

eventMajor4.message=%s, several personnel have fallen ill - turns out their rations were poisoned!\
  \ Investigation reveals a prisoner managed to sabotage the supply lines, and we have reason to\
  \ believe there's more poison hidden somewhere. The affected personnel aren't in a critical\
  \ condition, but panic is spreading. We need immediate instructions to secure the supplies\
  \ and contain this threat before it gets worse!
responseMajorA4.button=Shut down food distribution
responseMajorA4.tooltip=Halt all meals temporarily and investigate thoroughly, even if it angers\
  \ the prisoners.
responseMajorA4.success=%s, food distribution was immediately halted, and a thorough investigation\
  \ uncovered additional poisoned rations hidden in the supply. The prisoners were angered by the\
  \ disruption, but no further cases of poisoning occurred, and panic has subsided. Security\
  \ protocols have been reinforced, and the situation is now under control.
responseMajorA4.failure=%s, shutting down food distribution caused widespread outrage among the\
  \ prisoners, sparking unrest and even minor skirmishes in the holding area. Despite the\
  \ disruption, we failed to locate additional poison in the supply. Tensions remain high, and the\
  \ facility's stability is precarious.
responseMajorB4.button=Punish the suspected saboteur
responseMajorB4.tooltip=Identify and punish a likely suspect to deter further attempts.
responseMajorB4.success=%s, the suspected saboteur was identified and punished. The decisive action\
  \ has sent a clear message to the prisoners, deterring further attempts to sabotage the rations.\
  \ The situation has calmed, and food distribution has resumed under tighter security measures.\
  \ Panic has been contained, and the affected personnel are recovering.
responseMajorB4.failure=%s, punishing the suspected saboteur backfired - our evidence was\
  \ inconclusive, and the prisoners are now accusing us of scapegoating. Distrust has spread, and\
  \ some prisoners are refusing their rations entirely. While no further poison has been found, the\
  \ facility remains on edge, and tensions are rising.
responseMajorC4.button=Increase food inspections
responseMajorC4.tooltip=Focus on longer-term security measures while addressing the immediate crisis.
responseMajorC4.success=%s, food inspections were ramped up immediately, and we identified and\
  \ removed several poisoned rations from circulation. While the process delayed food distribution,\
  \ it reassured the prisoners and guards alike. The affected personnel are recovering, and the\
  \ enhanced security measures have stabilized the situation.
responseMajorC4.failure=%s, increased food inspections failed to uncover any additional poison, and\
  \ the delays in distribution only added to the tension. Some prisoners are accusing us of\
  \ negligence, while others are growing restless from the prolonged restrictions. The threat of\
  \ further sabotage remains unresolved, and morale is low across the facility.

eventMajor5.message=%s, we have an emergency! During a routine inspection, a group of prisoners\
  \ overpowered the guards and has taken one of my men hostage! They're demanding better\
  \ conditions and immediate release, threatening to kill the hostage if their demands aren't met.\
  \ The situation is extremely volatile, and we don't know how long we have to negotiate. We need\
  \ your orders immediately!
responseMajorA5.button=Negotiate for time
responseMajorA5.tooltip=Stall the prisoners with minor concessions while preparing a rescue operation.
responseMajorA5.success=%s, the negotiations bought us enough time to organize a successful rescue\
  \ operation. The hostage was freed with only minor injuries, and the prisoners involved have been\
  \ subdued and detained. While the situation was tense, the outcome was a success, and order has\
  \ been restored.
responseMajorA5.failure=%s, the negotiations stalled, and the prisoners used the delay to reinforce\
  \ their position. By the time we attempted the rescue, they executed the hostage and inflicted\
  \ heavy casualties on the assault team. The situation has been resolved, but at a devastating\
  \ cost to morale and trust in our ability to maintain control.
responseMajorB5.button=Storm the area
responseMajorB5.tooltip=Launch a risky assault to save the hostage, regardless of casualties.
responseMajorB5.success=%s, the assault team acted swiftly, overwhelming the prisoners and rescuing\
  \ the hostage. While there were minor injuries during the operation, the hostage was recovered\
  \ alive, and the prisoners responsible have been secured. The operation was a success, and the\
  \ facility is under control once again.
responseMajorB5.failure=%s, the assault to rescue the hostage failed. The prisoners killed the\
  \ hostage during the attack, and several guards were injured or killed in the chaos. Although the\
  \ prisoners were eventually subdued, the cost was high, and morale among the security team has\
  \ plummeted. The facility is secure, but the scars from this event will linger.
responseMajorC5.button=Refuse their demands outright
responseMajorC5.tooltip=Take a hardline stance, knowing the hostage's life may be lost.
responseMajorC5.success=%s, taking a hardline stance paid off. The prisoners hesitated and\
  \ ultimately released the hostage unharmed, fearing retaliation. The guards quickly subdued the\
  \ ringleaders, and the situation has been resolved without bloodshed. While tensions remain high,\
  \ the facility is stable, and our authority has been reinforced.
responseMajorC5.failure=%s, refusing their demands led to the worst outcome. The prisoners executed\
  \ the hostage and escalated their defiance, forcing guards to intervene with deadly force. The\
  \ situation was ultimately contained, but the loss of life and the display of violence have left\
  \ the facility in a state of shock.

eventMajor6.message=%s, a prisoner-planted explosive just detonated in a critical part of the\
  \ facility - the power generator has been hit! Systems are failing, and the blast has\
  \ thrown everything into chaos. The prisoners are using the confusion to launch a coordinated\

  \ reinforcements and immediate orders before the situation spirals completely out of control!
responseMajorA6.button=Secure critical areas
responseMajorA6.tooltip=Focus on protecting vital systems to prevent further damage, even if\
  \ prisoners escape.
responseMajorA6.success=%s, critical areas of the facility have been secured. While a few prisoners\
  \ managed to escape during the chaos, the guards successfully protected vital systems, preventing\
  \ further damage. The power generator is offline but intact enough to be repaired. The situation\
  \ is now under control, and the facility's stability has been preserved.
responseMajorA6.failure=%s, we focused on securing critical systems, but the effort came at a cost.\
  \ A large group of prisoners managed to escape in the confusion, and damage to the generator is\
  \ extensive. While the immediate threat has been contained, the facility is in disarray, and the\
  \ escapees are unaccounted for.
responseMajorB6.button=Pursue the saboteurs
responseMajorB6.tooltip=Send guards after the responsible prisoners, prioritizing retribution over\
  \ repairs.
responseMajorB6.success=%s, the guards tracked down and captured the saboteurs behind the\
  \ explosion. Their capture has prevented further coordinated attacks, though the effort left\
  \ other parts of the facility vulnerable. The damage to the generator is extensive, but with the\
  \ ringleaders in custody, the prisoners' momentum has been crushed, and order is being restored.
responseMajorB6.failure=%s, pursuing the saboteurs backfired. While the guards managed to apprehend\
  \ some of them, the delay in securing vital systems allowed the breakout to spiral out of\
  \ control. Many prisoners escaped, and the generator sustained catastrophic damage. The situation\
  \ is under control for now, but the losses are severe.
responseMajorC6.button=Call for reinforcements
responseMajorC6.tooltip=Bring in additional manpower to handle the chaos, though it may leave other\
  \ areas vulnerable.
responseMajorC6.success=%s, reinforcements arrived just in time to help contain the breakout and\
  \ stabilize the facility. The coordinated attack was repelled, and the majority of the prisoners\
  \ involved have been subdued or recaptured. The generator is damaged, but the facility is secure,\
  \ and order has been restored.
responseMajorC6.failure=%s, reinforcements arrived too late to prevent widespread chaos. By the\
  \ time they intervened, significant damage had been done to the generator, and many prisoners had\
  \ already escaped. While the facility has been stabilized, the aftermath of the breakout will\
  \ take considerable time and resources to address.

eventMajor7.message=%s, we've got a crisis - prisoners just carried out a public execution in the\
  \ holding area, claiming the victim was a collaborator. By the time we\
  \ arrived, it was too late to stop it. Now the prisoners are openly defiant, treating this as a\
  \ show of strength. Tensions are boiling over, and the situation could escalate into full-scale\
  \ violence at any moment. We need orders immediately - how do we contain this?
responseMajorA7.button=Punish the mob leaders
responseMajorA7.tooltip=Identify and publicly punish those responsible to reassert control.
responseMajorA7.success=%s, the mob leaders were identified and swiftly punished, sending a clear\
  \ message to the rest of the prisoners. While tensions remain high, the show of authority has\
  \ reasserted control over the population. The situation has been stabilized, and no further\
  \ violence has occurred.
responseMajorA7.failure=%s, our attempt to punish the mob leaders backfired. The prisoners\
  \ retaliated violently, escalating the situation into a full-blown riot. Several guards were\
  \ injured, and parts of the facility sustained damage before order was finally restored. The\
  \ aftermath has left the facility on edge and resources stretched thin.
responseMajorB7.button=Divide and isolate factions
responseMajorB7.tooltip=Separate prisoners based on alliances to reduce tensions, even if it\
  \ spreads your resources thin.
responseMajorB7.success=%s, faction leaders were identified, and the prisoners were divided and\
  \ isolated based on their alliances. The separation has reduced tensions significantly,\
  \ preventing further outbreaks of violence. While the approach has stretched our resources, the\
  \ facility is now stable, and control has been reestablished.
responseMajorB7.failure=%s, ividing the prisoners only created new flashpoints, as tensions flared\
  \ within the isolated groups. The strain on our resources made it difficult to maintain order,\
  \ and skirmishes broke out across multiple sections of the facility. The situation has been\
  \ contained, but the fractures among the population remain volatile.
responseMajorC7.button=Use this as a warning
responseMajorC7.tooltip=Let the execution stand as a grim reminder of what happens to traitors.
responseMajorC7.success=%s, we let the execution stand as a warning to the population, and the grim\
  \ message seems to have worked. The prisoners are subdued, recognizing the consequences of\
  \ defiance among their own. While this approach has left lingering unease, the facility is\
  \ secure, and no further incidents have occurred.
responseMajorC7.failure=%s, treating the execution as a warning backfired. Instead of deterring\
  \ unrest, it emboldened the prisoners, who now view it as a victory. Defiance is spreading, and\
  \ tensions in the facility are at an all-time high. While the situation hasn't escalated into\
  \ open violence yet, it's dangerously close.

eventMajor8.message=%s, we've just uncovered a horrifying situation - a neglected wing of the\
  \ compound was rediscovered after prisoners were mistakenly transferred there during a chaotic\
  \ intake process. Guards found emaciated bodies, skeletal prisoners barely clinging to life, and\
  \ others who didn't survive. The survivors are pleading for rescue and accusing us of abandoning\
  \ them. This could spiral into chaos if word spreads further. We need immediate orders on how to\
  \ handle this before it turns into a full-blown crisis.
responseMajorA8.button=Provide immediate aid
responseMajorA8.tooltip=Dedicate resources to saving the survivors, even if it strains your supplies.
responseMajorA8.success=%s, immediate aid was provided to the survivors, stabilizing their\
  \ condition. While this strained our supplies and personnel, the effort has quelled accusations\
  \ and restored a measure of trust among the prisoners. The situation has been contained, and\
  \ morale is recovering, though resources remain tight.
responseMajorA8.failure=%s, despite our efforts to provide aid, it was too late for many of the\
  \ prisoners. The survivors are resentful and spreading accusations of negligence, fueling unrest\
  \ in the facility. The strain on our supplies has left us vulnerable, and tensions are rising\
  \ among both prisoners and staff.
responseMajorB8.button=Hide the evidence
responseMajorB8.tooltip=Quietly cover up the incident to prevent morale loss or political fallout.
responseMajorB8.success=%s, the incident was quietly covered up. The bodies were removed, and the\
  \ surviving prisoners were integrated back into the general population under close observation.\
  \ No information has leaked, and the situation has been contained without further fallout. The\
  \ facility remains stable.
responseMajorB8.failure=%s, the attempt to cover up the incident failed. Word spread among the\
  \ prisoners before we could act, and now the population is furious, accusing us of hiding\
  \ atrocities. The backlash has destabilized the facility, and maintaining control will be\
  \ challenging in the days ahead.
responseMajorC8.button=Blame the prisoners
responseMajorC8.tooltip=Shift responsibility for the disaster onto the prisoners themselves to\
  \ maintain control over the remaining population.
responseMajorC8.success=%s, shifting responsibility to the prisoners has diffused blame from our\
  \ crew. By framing the incident as a result of infighting and poor organization among the\
  \ prisoners, we've avoided further accusations. While tensions remain, the population is subdued,\
  \ and the facility is stable for now.
responseMajorC8.failure=%s, blaming the prisoners only inflamed the situation. The survivors and\
  \ their allies have become openly defiant, accusing us of cruelty and negligence. The unrest is\
  \ spreading, and the situation is dangerously close to spiraling out of control. The facility is\
  \ on edge, and stability is tenuous.

eventMajor9.message=%s, we've got a major crisis - prisoners from rival groups have set aside their\
  \ differences and formed a united front against us! Their cooperation has allowed them to\
  \ overwhelm my guards and seize control of an entire holding wing. They're fortifying\

  \ orders on how to retake the area before this escalates even more!
responseMajorA9.button=Divide and conquer
responseMajorA9.tooltip=Exploit old rivalries to shatter the alliance from within.
responseMajorA9.success=%s, we exploited old rivalries among the prisoners, planting rumors and\
  \ sowing distrust within their alliance. The united front shattered as factions turned on each\
  \ other, allowing guards to retake the holding wing with minimal resistance. The facility is\
  \ secure, and tensions among the prisoners are back to manageable levels.
responseMajorA9.failure=%s, our attempts to divide the alliance failed. The prisoners saw through\
  \ the ploy and grew even more unified against us. They've tightened their defenses, and the\
  \ holding wing remains under their control. Regaining control required significant force.
responseMajorB9.button=Launch a full assault
responseMajorB9.tooltip=Retake the area with overwhelming force, even if it costs lives.
responseMajorB9.success=%s, the full assault succeeded. Guards overwhelmed the prisoners with\
  \ decisive force, retaking the holding wing. While there were casualties on both sides, the\
  \ operation reestablished control over the area, and the remaining prisoners have been subdued.\
  \ The facility is stable once again.
responseMajorB9.failure=%s, the full assault failed. The prisoners were heavily fortified, and the\
  \ guards suffered significant casualties during the operation. Despite the effort, the holding\
  \ wing remains under their control, and morale among our personnel has taken a severe hit. The\
  \ prisoners are emboldened, and the situation is critical.
responseMajorC9.button=Cut them off
responseMajorC9.tooltip=Seal the wing and starve the prisoners of resources, forcing them to\
  \ surrender over time.
responseMajorC9.success=%s, we sealed off the holding wing, cutting the prisoners off from\
  \ resources and reinforcements. Over time, their supplies dwindled, and they were forced to\
  \ surrender. The operation was a success, with minimal casualties, and the facility is back under\
  \ our control.
responseMajorC9.failure=%s, cutting off the holding wing backfired. The prisoners found ways to\
  \ fortify their position and scavenged resources to sustain themselves. Meanwhile, unrest spread\
  \ among the rest of the population, who view this as proof of our cruelty. The situation is\
  \ deteriorating rapidly, and the facility's stability is now at risk.
