free.report={0} has been freed.
freeEvent0.message={0}, as ordered, we''ve released prisoners from the overcrowded sections. They\
  \ were processed swiftly, provided minimal supplies for their journey, and escorted beyond the\

  \ included in the release.
freeEvent1.message={0}, we''ve freed a group of prisoners deemed least likely to pose a threat. They\

  \ wary.
freeEvent3.message={0}, a number of prisoners were freed from the holding wing. They were escorted\
  \ to the outer perimeter, and the gates were sealed behind them. The atmosphere in the facility\
  \ has stabilized somewhat, with guards reporting a noticeable reduction in tension.

  \ processed thoroughly, ensuring no contraband or intelligence was removed from the facility.\

  \ without incident, and the remaining prisoners are subdued for now.
freeEvent11.message={0}, the release of prisoners has been completed. The process went smoother than\
  \ expected, with no resistance from the remaining population. Overcrowding in the cells is no\
  \ longer an issue, and the guards are reporting a much-needed reprieve.
freeEvent12.message={0}, the prisoner release has been carried out. While the operation was\
  \ successful, some of our men expressed frustration at seeing hardened combatants set free.\
  \ Nonetheless, the cells are now at manageable levels, and we remain vigilant for any\
  \ repercussions.
freeEvent13.message={0}, as ordered, some prisoners were released earlier today. The process was\
  \ conducted methodically, ensuring no disruptions. While this decision has relieved pressure on\
  \ the facility, it''s a calculated risk that we''ll monitor closely.
freeEvent14.message={0}, prisoners have been processed and released from custody. The operation was\
  \ completed without complications, and the overcrowding in the holding area has been alleviated.\
  \ Guards are resuming standard operations.
freeEvent15.message={0}, the release of prisoners is complete. Each was escorted out under heavy\
  \ guard, and no incidents occurred during the operation. While this eases the strain on the\
  \ facility, we remain acutely aware of the potential consequences of their return to enemy\
  \ forces.
freeEvent16.message={0}, the transfer of prisoners has been completed successfully. The process went\
  \ according to plan, and the remaining detainees have been compliant since the release. The\
  \ facility is back within capacity, and the guards are reporting improved morale.
freeEvent17.message={0}, we''ve completed the prisoner release. While the immediate overcrowding\
  \ issue has been resolved, some of my men have expressed concern that we may have released\
  \ valuable assets back to the enemy. Nevertheless, the facility is stable for now.
freeEvent18.message={0}, prisoners have been released into enemy custody. While this decision has\
  \ brought relief to the holding areas, it''s clear the remaining population is still watching\
  \ closely. The operation proceeded without incident, but the tension in the air remains palpable.
freeEvent19.message={0}, we''ve released some prisoners as instructed. The process was conducted\
  \ under strict oversight, ensuring compliance from the remaining detainees. We''re maintaining\
  \ heightened vigilance to ensure this release doesn''t embolden the remaining population.
freeEvent20.message={0}, we''ve released some prisoners. Many were barely able to walk, their bodies\
  \ frail from confinement. The look in their eyes spoke volumes - fear, anger, and the haunting\
  \ emptiness of souls broken by captivity. The operation is complete, but the weight of what we''ve\
  \ witnessed remains heavy.
freeEvent21.message={0}, prisoners have been freed. Their gaunt faces and trembling hands were a\
  \ stark reminder of the suffering they''ve endured. Some whispered words of home as they stepped\
  \ out, others said nothing at all. The guards are shaken; this wasn''t an easy task.
freeEvent22.message={0}, we''ve carried out the prisoner release. Their condition is\
  \ harrowing - emaciated, covered in bruises, and barely clinging to what humanity remains. Some\
  \ clutched photographs or trinkets as they shuffled out, shadows of the warriors they once were.
freeEvent23.message={0}, the release of prisoners has been completed. Their state was worse than\
  \ expected - sunken eyes, skeletal frames, and the unmistakable marks of prolonged suffering. Some\
  \ cried as they left, others stared blankly ahead. This is a grim chapter for us all.
freeEvent24.message={0}, prisoners were freed today, though it feels like releasing ghosts. Their\
  \ bodies are wasted, their minds distant. Some guards avoided looking at them directly, ashamed\
  \ of the conditions we allowed to persist. The task is done, but the memory will linger.
freeEvent25.message={0}, we''ve released the prisoners. Their silent, hollow stares told us\
  \ everything we needed to know about their time here. A few clung to each other as they walked\
  \ out, their camaraderie the only thing keeping them from falling apart entirely.
freeEvent26.message={0}, the release of prisoners is complete. The sight of them leaving - many\
  \ limping, others being carried - was gut-wrenching. Their frailty and the haunted looks on their\
  \ faces left no doubt about the toll of captivity. It''s a scene none of us will forget.
freeEvent27.message={0}, as ordered, prisoners were released today. Their gaunt frames and unsteady\
  \ steps were a chilling reminder of what captivity has done to them. Some guards muttered prayers\
  \ as they watched them go, grappling with the horrors we''ve witnessed firsthand.
freeEvent28.message={0}, the release of prisoners has been completed. The holding cells are quieter\
  \ now, but the memory of their suffering hangs heavy. Their skeletal forms and the marks of\
  \ restraint are a testament to the grim reality of war. We''ll carry this burden long after\
  \ they''ve gone.
freeEvent29.message={0}, prisoners were freed today. Their condition was devastating - sunken cheeks,\
  \ scars both old and new, and a silence that seemed louder than any scream. The sight visibly\
  \ shook even my guards. The task is done, but the cost is something we''ll all carry.
freeEvent30.message={0}, the prisoner release was completed, but it wasn''t without incident. Some\
  \ prisoners refused to leave, claiming they had no homes to return to, while others argued\
  \ violently about who deserved freedom. Guards had to intervene multiple times to prevent\
  \ serious altercations.
freeEvent31.message={0}, prisoners were released, but the process descended into chaos. Fights broke\
  \ out among the prisoners as they vied for supplies, and several guards sustained minor injuries\
  \ trying to separate them. Order has been restored, but tensions remain high.
freeEvent32.message={0}, the prisoner release has been carried out, but some prisoners sabotaged\
  \ their cells before leaving, damaging locks and equipment. The release caused an uproar among\
  \ the remaining population, who''re now demanding to know when they will be freed.
freeEvent33.message={0}, as we prepared to release the prisoners, a group of them resisted, accusing\
  \ us of sending them to their deaths. Some of the remaining prisoners joined in the shouting,\
  \ forcing my guards to act swiftly to regain control. The operation continued, but tensions are\
  \ simmering.
freeEvent34.message={0}, prisoners were released today, but the operation nearly collapsed when one\
  \ prisoner attempted to take a guard hostage, claiming they deserved "revenge" for their\
  \ treatment. The guard was unharmed, and the prisoner was restrained, but the mood remains\
  \ hostile.
freeEvent35.message={0}, the prisoner release was delayed when we discovered one of them had\
  \ sabotaged the gate mechanism to prevent the process from moving forward. Repairs took several\
  \ hours, and while the release was eventually completed, the incident has put everyone on edge.
freeEvent36.message={0}, prisoners were released today, but the process was marred by hostility.\
  \ Many hurled insults at the guards, blaming them for the conditions they endured. A few had to\
  \ be forcibly removed from the premises, escalating tensions among those left behind.
freeEvent37.message={0}, prisoners were freed today, but the operation caused a stir among the\
  \ remaining population. Prisoners not chosen for release have begun muttering about favoritism\
  \ and threatening to disrupt future operations. The guards are keeping a close eye on the\
  \ situation.
freeEvent38.message={0}, as we released the prisoners, one collapsed during the final checks,\
  \ claiming severe illness. The guards had to call for medical assistance, delaying the operation\
  \ and causing frustration among the other prisoners. The release was eventually completed, but\
  \ the situation left many guards on edge.
freeEvent39.message={0}, prisoners were released, but the operation turned tense when several of\
  \ them openly declared their intention to rejoin the fight against us. Their defiance unsettled\
  \ my men, and their words riled up the remaining population. While the release was completed, the\
  \ atmosphere in the facility is now significantly more volatile.
freeEvent40.message={0}, during the prisoner release, two rival prisoners shocked everyone by\
  \ shaking hands as they walked out. Their followers cheered, and the remaining prisoners are\
  \ abuzz with rumors of an alliance forming outside the facility. The guards are uneasy, as this\
  \ could spell trouble for the future.
freeEvent41.message={0}, as we prepared to release the prisoners, the commotion allowed three others\
  \ to slip past the guards unnoticed. We''ve secured the facility, and the missing prisoners are\
  \ accounted for. This incident has raised questions about security protocols during operations\
  \ like this.
freeEvent42.message={0}, the release of prisoners nearly failed when one of them detonated a hidden\
  \ explosive device just outside the perimeter, damaging the gates and a holding cell. The\
  \ prisoner claimed it was a "farewell gift." While the others left without incident, tensions in\
  \ the facility are high.
freeEvent43.message={0}, during the prisoner release, one of them suddenly collapsed and died before\
  \ they could leave. The cause is unclear, though initial signs point to malnutrition or\
  \ exhaustion. The incident delayed the operation, and the remaining prisoners are spreading\
  \ rumors of foul play.
freeEvent44.message={0}, as they were released, a group of prisoners held up scraps of fabric\
  \ stitched together into their faction''s banner, chanting slogans of defiance. The display\
  \ enraged some of the remaining prisoners, leading to scuffles in the holding area. Guards\
  \ intervened to prevent further escalation.
freeEvent45.message={0}, prisoners were released, but not before conducting an eerie ritual in the\
  \ holding area. They marked their faces with soot, spoke in hushed chants, and vowed revenge\
  \ before leaving. My guards are deeply unsettled, and the remaining prisoners are whispering\
  \ about what the ritual meant.
freeEvent46.message={0}, during the prisoner release, guards discovered that two individuals\
  \ attempting to leave weren''t on the release list. They had swapped identification with others\
  \ in the cells. The imposters were detained, but the real prisoners meant for release remain\
  \ unaccounted for, and we''re conducting a headcount to determine their whereabouts
freeEvent47.message={0}, prisoners were released, but one left behind a chilling message scrawled on\
  \ the wall of their cell: "We''ll meet again in the ashes." The guards are rattled, and the\
  \ remaining prisoners seem energized by the act. The situation in the holding area is growing\
  \ tense.
freeEvent48.message={0}, during the release, one guard was found attempting to leave disguised as a\
  \ detainee. When questioned, they confessed to trying to desert under the guise of the operation.\
  \ The situation was handled discreetly, but the remaining guards are questioning their loyalty to\
  \ the mission.
freeEvent49.message={0}, prisoners were freed today, but the operation took an emotional turn when\
  \ one of them spotted a guard they recognized from a past battle. Tensions flared, and the two\
  \ nearly came to blows before the situation was de-escalated. The release was completed, but the\
  \ incident has left both parties visibly shaken.

executeEvent0.message={0}, the prisoners have been executed as per your orders. We isolated them in\
  \ the eastern storage hangar to ensure no civilians or non-essential personnel were present. Each\
  \ was dealt with quickly and efficiently, minimizing unnecessary commotion.
executeEvent1.message=<p>{0}, the task is done, but I''ll be honest - I didn''t sign up for this. These\
  \ were just warriors who surrendered when the odds turned. Some of them begged. I kept it\
  \ clean, no unnecessary pain, but this sits heavy.</p>\
  <p>The team''s quiet now. Nobody''s saying much, but I can see it on their faces. If this is the\
  \ new norm for our outfit, we might need to start asking ourselves who we''re becoming.</p>
executeEvent2.message={0}, the prisoners have been eliminated as instructed. Execution took place in\
  \ the quarry, far from camp, ensuring no witnesses or disruptions. Disposal is handled; no\
  \ evidence remains.
executeEvent3.message=<p>{0}, prisoners are no longer an issue. Execution was carried out in a\
  \ controlled manner behind the east perimeter. No complications arose, and the cleanup team has\
  \ finished their part.</p>\
  <p>Recommend avoiding this site for at least 48 hours while residual traces are dealt with.\
  \ Moving forward, it might be worth considering alternative methods to minimize resource use.</p>
executeEvent4.message=<p>{0}, it''s done. I don''t like it, but it''s done. You should know some of\
  \ these folks weren''t even combatants anymore - they barely put up a fight. But hey, I''m\
  \ sure your spreadsheets say it makes sense to treat prisoners like liabilities.</p>\
  <p>If this is where we''re headed as a company, I need to think about whether I belong here.</p>
executeEvent5.message={0}, the prisoners have been executed as per your directive. I ensured it was\
  \ handled as cleanly and professionally as possible. That said, I feel it''s my duty to express\
  \ concern over the potential fallout of such actions. News travels fast, and this could harm our\
  \ reputation with future employers.
executeEvent6.message={0}, prisoners are taken care of. No mess, no fuss. One of them tried to talk\
  \ their way out, but we shut that down fast. No loose ends to worry about.
executeEvent7.message=<p>{0}, the prisoners were dealt with, as you ordered. I carried out the task\
  \ personally, ensuring there was no unnecessary suffering. I''ll be blunt - I don''t know how the\
  \ team will respond to this long-term. Morale''s already shaky, and this sort of thing has a way\
  \ of sticking with people.</p>\
  <p>I suggest we give the squad some downtime to process. I''ll do what I can to keep things\
  \ steady.</p>
executeEvent8.message={0}, the prisoners are no longer a factor. I understand there may be\
  \ criticism, but let''s be clear: they were a security risk. Even under guard, we couldn''t\
  \ guarantee they wouldn''t escape or sabotage our operations.
executeEvent9.message={0}, prisoners are handled. Nothing fancy, nothing drawn out - they''re gone. Let\
  \ me know if there''s anything else you need cleaned up.
executeEvent10.message=<p>{0}, it''s done. I can''t say I feel good about it, but I don''t suppose that\
  \ matters. They were defeated, powerless - part of me wonders what we achieve by killing men who''ve\
  \ already lost.</p>\
  <p>Still, I followed through because that''s what you expect. Orders are orders, and I''m here to\
  \ do the job. I just hope this isn''t the kind of thing that defines us moving forward.</p>
executeEvent11.message=<p>{0}, the prisoners have been dealt with, but we encountered complications.\
  \ Two of them overpowered a guard and tried to escape before the execution. We neutralized them,\
  \ but one of our people took a knife to the leg. The rest were executed without further\
  \ incident.</p>\
  <p>Recommend reviewing security procedures to avoid future disruptions. Let me know if you need a\
  \ full report.</p>
executeEvent12.message={0}, we carried out the execution as ordered, but I''ve just received\
  \ confirmation that one of the prisoners was an allied operative. Their credentials didn''t check\
  \ out during processing. I take full responsibility for the oversight and await your instructions\
  \ on handling the fallout.
executeEvent13.message={0}, the task is complete, but there''s a problem. Civilians from a nearby\
  \ settlement stumbled onto the site just after we began. They saw too much before we could\
  \ disperse them. If they decide to talk, this could blow back on us hard.
executeEvent14.message={0}, execution of the prisoners is done, but there were complications with\
  \ the team. One guard refused to participate outright and has since isolated himself from the\
  \ unit. Another is showing signs of severe distress. The task weighed heavily on all of us.
executeEvent15.message=<p>{0}, the prisoners sabotaged their holding area before we moved them for\
  \ execution. They jammed the gate mechanism and damaged some of the restraints. It delayed the\
  \ operation by several hours, and we had to subdue them with stun rounds before proceeding.</p>\
  <p>The task is now complete, but it wasn''t clean. I''ll include a report on the equipment damage\
  \ for review.</p>
executeEvent16.message={0}, we began the execution as ordered, but conflicting instructions from\
  \ central command reached us mid-task, demanding the prisoners be kept alive for questioning. Two\
  \ were already dealt with before the halt. The remaining three have been restrained and returned\
  \ to holding.
executeEvent17.message={0}, the execution turned chaotic. While en route to the site, one of the\
  \ prisoners triggered a concealed explosive device during a struggle. Two guards were lightly\
  \ injured, and three prisoners were killed in the blast. The remaining two were executed\
  \ afterward, but the incident could draw unwanted attention.
executeEvent18.message=<p>{0}, we encountered complications at the execution site. Sudden\
  \ bad weather forced us to abandon the operation mid-task. The high winds made\
  \ it unsafe to proceed, and transporting the prisoners back to base was risky, but they''re\
  \ secured in the auxiliary bunker for now.</p>\
  <p>Once the storm clears, we''ll carry out your orders.</p>
executeEvent19.message=<p>{0}, the execution order was carried out, but it didn''t go smoothly. One\
  \ of the prisoners incited the others to attack while being moved to the site. They managed to\
  \ lightly injure a guard and nearly succeeded in overpowering another. The mutiny was suppressed,\
  \ but it forced us to execute them on the spot instead of the planned location.</p>\
  <p>The situation is contained, and cleanup is underway. We''ll double-check procedures to prevent\
  \ another incident.</p>
executeEvent20.message=<p>{0}, it''s done. I can''t shake the sound they made, though - the pleading,\
  \ the sobbing. They knew what was coming, and that''s what makes this so much worse. These weren''t\
  \ combatants anymore. They were just... people.</p>\
  <p>We did what you asked, but I''ll tell you this: some things don''t wash off, no matter how many\
  \ orders you follow.</p>
executeEvent21.message=<p>{0}, the prisoners are gone, but I can''t stop thinking about the way they\
  \ looked at me. Not angry or defiant - just scared. One of them even said thank you when I offered\
  \ them water before the end. I keep asking myself if that was mercy or cruelty.</p>\
  <p>I don''t know how to forget their faces.</p>
executeEvent22.message=<p>{0}, the order has been carried out, but there was a problem. One of my\
  \ men refused to follow through. He broke down during the task, crying and shaking. I had to\
  \ finish their part myself. I''ll handle discipline on my end, but... I think they''re shattered.\
  \ This kind of thing breaks people.</p>\
  <p>Recommend pulling him from active duty for now.</p>
executeEvent23.message=<p>{0}, the prisoners begged. They begged right up until the end. I didn''t\
  \ want to listen, but it''s impossible to block out. One of them swore they''d do anything if we\
  \ let them go - offered us intel, even credits. I carried out the task because I know the price of\
  \ disobedience.</p>\
  <p>But their voices keep echoing in my head. I did the job, but what kind of people does this\
  \ make us?</p>
executeEvent24.message=<p>{0}, the job is done. It''s quiet here now - too quiet. No one on the team is\
  \ speaking, not even the usual chatter on comms. You can feel it hanging in the air, the weight\
  \ of what we just did.</p>\
  <p>I know this is part of the business, but today, it feels like we crossed a line that we can''t\
  \ uncross.</p>
executeEvent25.message=<p>{0}, the last prisoner was unarmed, kneeling, and crying. They didn''t even\
  \ resist, just asked to see their family one last time. I... I made sure it was quick, but it\
  \ didn''t feel like mercy. It felt like murder.</p>\
  <p>I know we have reasons for this, but it''s starting to feel like we''re no better than the\
  \ people we''re fighting.</p>
executeEvent26.message=<p>{0}, it''s done. The bodies have been disposed of, but the team is falling\
  \ apart. Two guards are talking about leaving the company, saying they can''t handle this kind of\
  \ work. Another hasn''t said a word since it happened.</p>\
  <p>If we keep giving orders like this, we''ll lose more than just soldiers - we''ll lose our\
  \ humanity.</p>
executeEvent27.message=<p>{0}, one of the prisoners asked if they could pray before we executed\
  \ them. I allowed it, thinking it might bring them peace. Instead, it tore the team apart\
  \ emotionally. Some of us couldn''t look away. One guard even started crying.</p>\
  <p>The task was completed, but it left us all shaken. This isn''t just killing enemies - it''s\
  \ killing hope.</p>
executeEvent28.message=<p>{0}, the prisoners are gone. Their last words won''t leave me. One cursed\
  \ us, one begged, and another just kept saying, "It''s not fair." I thought I was hardened to this\
  \ kind of thing, but something about this order feels... wrong.</p>\
  <p>We carried it out because that''s what we do, but I don''t know how much more of this the\
  \ team - or I - can take.</p>
executeEvent29.message=<p>{0}, it''s done. I followed through personally, just like you asked. I\
  \ washed my hands afterward, but I can still feel the blood. It doesn''t matter how many times I\
  \ tell myself they were enemies - there''s something deeply wrong about killing people who can''t\
  \ fight back.</p>\
  <p>I don''t know if I''m the person you think I am, but I''ll keep trying to be.</p>
executeEvent30.message=<p>{0}, it''s over, but the walk back felt endless. None of us said a word.\
  \ The prisoners were crying, shouting, some just staring, resigned. When it was done, all I could\
  \ hear was the wind.</p>\
  <p>I know we''ve done worse things in combat, but this feels different. It wasn''t war - it was\
  \ slaughter. The guards under my command will follow orders, but today I think we lost a piece of\
  \ ourselves.</p>\
  <p>I''ll follow your lead, as always, but I had to tell you what this cost us.</p>
executeEvent31.message={0}, it''s done, but the screams won''t stop. They didn''t go quietly. Some\
  \ of them cried for their families, others screamed until their voices broke. Even when it was\
  \ over, the echoes felt louder than the gunshots.
executeEvent32.message=<p>{0}, it''s done. One of them asked if their mother would find out what\
  \ happened to them. I told them no. I lied. Then I pulled the trigger.</p>\
  <p>Whatever these orders accomplish, I hope you''re ready to live with them. Because I''m not sure\
  \ if I can.</p>
executeEvent33.message=<p>{0}, it''s done, but not without incident. Half the team refused to go\
  \ through with it, and the others forced them aside to finish the job. There was shouting,\
  \ cursing, even a fistfight before it was over. These weren''t soldiers - it was like watching\
  \ animals tear each other apart.</p>\
  <p>I''m not sure if the team will ever recover from this. Maybe none of us will.</p>
executeEvent34.message=<p>{0}, they knew what was coming before we even lined them up. Some tried to\
  \ joke, saying, "Make it quick." Others just knelt, trembling, as if they were already dead. The\
  \ worst part was the silence afterward, the sound of boots on blood-soaked ground.</p>\
  <p>We followed orders, but it felt like a massacre.</p>
executeEvent35.message=<p>{0}, one of my men broke down halfway through, sobbing as they pulled the\
  \ trigger. I had to step in and finish their part. Now they''re curled up in a corner of the\
  \ barracks, shaking like a child.</p>\
  <p>You can give us orders, but you can''t make us forget what we''ve done.</p>
executeEvent36.message=<p>{0}, one of the prisoners offered me everything - credits, intel, even their\
  \ own house - if I spared them. They were shaking so hard they could barely speak. I carried out\
  \ your orders anyway, but I''ll never forget the way their voice cracked as they begged.</p>\
  <p>Whatever we gained today, it wasn''t worth this.</p>
executeEvent37.message=<p>{0}, it''s done, but I''ll never forget the way they looked at me in those\
  \ final moments. Not hatred, not defiance - just confusion. Like they couldn''t believe we were the\
  \ ones doing this to them.</p>\
  <p>I keep asking myself: when we became monsters?</p>
executeEvent38.message=<p>{0}, the execution site was a horror show. We dug a trench and lined them\
  \ up. When it was over, we had to push the bodies into the pit with a loader. The stench, the\
  \ blood - it''s burned into my senses.</p>
executeEvent39.message=<p>{0}, one of the prisoners started singing. It was a slow, mournful\
  \ song - something about home. The others joined in, even as we raised our weapons. The sound\
  \ didn''t stop until the last one fell.</p>\
  <p>I''ve never heard anything so beautiful, and I hope I never do again.</p>
executeEvent40.message=<p>{0}, it''s done, but I have to ask: what do we tell ourselves to justify\
  \ this? That they were enemies? That they would''ve done the same to us? I''ve killed men on the\
  \ battlefield, but this wasn''t war. This was slaughter, plain and simple.</p>\
  <p>The blood''s on my hands now, but I hope it haunts you too.</p>
executeEvent41.message=<p>{0}, we moved the prisoners to the site as ordered, but the conditions\
  \ were brutal. The march was longer than expected, and we had no water to spare. When some\
  \ collapsed, the guards shot them on the spot to keep the others moving.</p>\
  <p>By the time we reached the site, half were dead already. The ones who made it didn''t even\
  \ resist - they were too weak. This wasn''t an execution. It was slow, grinding death.</p>
executeEvent42.message=<p>{0}, the task is complete. We took the prisoners into the forest, one by\
  \ one, and finished it there. I thought this would feel efficient, but instead, it was drawn out\
  \ and sickening. Each one realized what was happening when the sound of gunfire reached them.</p>\
  <p>The bodies are buried, but the stench lingers. We''ve buried more than people today. We''ve\
  \ buried our humanity.
executeEvent43.message=<p>{0}, the prisoners were executed, but the guards got carried away.\
  \ Civilians who were suspected of aiding them - women, children, the elderly - were rounded up as\
  \ well. By the time I realized what was happening, our firing squads were already at work.</p>\
  <p>This was chaos. There was no justice here, just blood. I''ll submit a report, but I don''t\
  \ know if we can clean this one up.</p>
executeEvent44.message=<p>{0}, the prisoners are dead, but this wasn''t an execution - it was a\
  \ massacre. Some of the guards recognized them as the ones who ambushed our supply convoy last\
  \ month. They didn''t wait for an order - they started shooting, laughing, and kicking the bodies\
  \ when it was over.</p>\
  <p>I tried to restore discipline, but it was too late. This was about vengeance, not orders.</p>
executeEvent45.message=<p>{0}, the prisoners were executed, but some of the guards took it too far.\
  \ Before the task was complete, they... I won''t put the details in writing, but what happened\
  \ before their deaths was nothing short of barbaric.</p>\
  <p>If this comes to light, it won''t just destroy the company''s reputation - it''ll destroy us.</p>
executeEvent46.message=<p>{0}, by the time we reached the prisoners, they were too weak to stand.\
  \ Whoever was supposed to feed them failed, and they hadn''t eaten in days. Most of them were\
  \ delirious, begging for water, food, anything.</p>\
  <p>We carried out the execution anyway, but this wasn''t punishment - it was a mercy killing. What''s\
  \ the point of this?</p>
executeEvent47.message=<p>{0}, the executions took hours. We lined them up in groups, forced them to\
  \ kneel, and shot them one at a time. By the end, one of the guards dropped their weapon and\
  \ started screaming. Another tried to run into the forest to escape the sight of it all.</p>\
  <p>The rest of us finished the job, but I''m not sure any of us will ever come back from this.</p>
executeEvent48.message=<p>{0}, it''s done. We didn''t just execute them; we erased them. No records,\
  \ no graves, no witnesses. It''s as if they never existed.</p>\
  <p>My men are shaken. Some of them whispered about what happens when our turn comes - when we''re\
  \ deemed expendable, too.</p>
executeEvent49.message=<p>{0}, your instructions to delay the execution for "psychological impact"\
  \ worked too well. The prisoners were made to dig their own graves, standing by as we pretended\
  \ to debate their fate. Some collapsed, crying, begging. One tried to throw themselves on our\
  \ rifles to end it early.</p>\
  <p>When we finally carried it out, it wasn''t just them who broke. Two guards started shaking so\
  \ badly they couldn''t hold their weapons, and another swore they''d never take another order like\
  \ this again. We followed through, but at a cost, I''m not sure if this team will survive.</p>

# MINOR
event.ARGUMENT.message={0}, we''ve just had an incident in the holding area. Two groups of\
  \ prisoners got into a heated argument - seems to be over some kind of personal grudge. We\
  \ managed to break it up before it got physical, but tensions are still high. Recommend increased\
  \ patrols in that sector and monitoring for any signs of further conflict. Awaiting further\
  \ instructions.
response.0.ARGUMENT.button=Remind them who''s in charge.
response.0.ARGUMENT.tooltip=Issue a stern warning that insubordination won''t be tolerated.
response.0.ARGUMENT.success={0}, the stern warning had the desired effect. The prisoners backed\
  \ down, and tensions in the holding area have eased. While there are still some mutterings of\
  \ discontent, the groups appear unwilling to escalate further. Order has been maintained for now.
response.0.ARGUMENT.failure={0}, the warning backfired. Rather than quelling the conflict, it only\
  \ seemed to provoke both groups further. They''ve grown defiant, blaming the guards for taking\
  \ sides. The situation in the holding area is more volatile than ever, and the guards are\
  \ struggling to maintain control.
response.1.ARGUMENT.button=Keep them separated
response.1.ARGUMENT.tooltip=Assign different holding areas to prevent further conflict.
response.1.ARGUMENT.success={0}, the groups have been assigned to separate holding areas, and the\
  \ move has successfully defused the immediate tension. Guards report that both groups are settling\
  \ down now that they''re no longer in close proximity. The situation appears stable.
response.1.ARGUMENT.failure={0}, separating the groups hasn''t resolved the issue. Instead, both\
  \ are using the distance to spread rumors and rally their allies. Guards report an increase in\
  \ hostilities, with tensions spilling into other areas of the facility. Containment is becoming\
  \ a challenge.
response.2.ARGUMENT.button=Let them work it out
response.2.ARGUMENT.tooltip=Avoid intervening. Sometimes enemies need to settle things themselves.
response.2.ARGUMENT.success={0}, the decision to let them handle their dispute on their own seems\
  \ to have worked. The groups appear to have reached an uneasy truce without further intervention.\
  \ Guards report that the situation has calmed down, and the holding area is returning to normal.
response.2.ARGUMENT.failure={0}, letting the groups work it out was a mistake. The argument\
  \ reignited and quickly escalated into a physical brawl, forcing guards to intervene. Several\
  \ prisoners and one guard sustained injuries in the chaos. The situation has been brought under\
  \ control, but the damage is done.

event.WILD_STORIES.message={0}, we''ve got an unusual situation in the holding area. One of the\
  \ prisoners has been keeping the others entertained with wild stories about daring escapes and\
  \ beating impossible odds. The guards overheard a few prisoners joking about trying their\
  \ "techniques." It might just be harmless talk, but it''s worth keeping an eye on them and their\
  \ audience. Suggest we step up vigilance and maybe isolate them if things escalate. Your call.
response.0.WILD_STORIES.button=Let them enjoy their stories
response.0.WILD_STORIES.tooltip=A little morale boost for the prisoners might keep them calmer.
response.0.WILD_STORIES.success={0}, allowing the prisoners to enjoy the stories seems to have had\
  \ a positive effect. The mood in the holding area has improved, and the prisoners appear more\
  \ relaxed. Guards report no signs of the stories being taken seriously as escape plans, and\
  \ tensions are low.
response.0.WILD_STORIES.failure={0}, letting the stories continue backfired. The prisoners became\
  \ emboldened, treating the tales as inspiration rather than entertainment. Guards have overheard\
  \ more serious conversations about escape attempts, and tensions are rising in the holding area.
response.1.WILD_STORIES.button=Shut this down
response.1.WILD_STORIES.tooltip=Order the guards to interrupt the story sessions. No need to\
  \ encourage bad ideas.
response.1.WILD_STORIES.success={0}, the guards put a stop to the story sessions, and the\
  \ ringleader has been warned to keep quiet. While some prisoners grumbled, the disruption has\
  \ prevented the stories from gaining any further traction. The situation in the holding area has\
  \ stabilized.
response.1.WILD_STORIES.failure={0}, shutting down the stories sparked backlash among the\
  \ prisoners. They''re accusing the guards of trying to crush any small semblance of morale. The\
  \ ringleader is now stirring up resentment against the staff, and the mood in the holding area is\
  \ more volatile.
response.2.WILD_STORIES.button=Listen in carefully
response.2.WILD_STORIES.tooltip=Have your guards take note of the tales - there might be useful\
  \ intel hidden in his words.
response.2.WILD_STORIES.success={0}, the guards carefully monitored the story sessions and noted\
  \ several key details. While most of it was harmless fiction, one tale revealed a potential weak\
  \ point in the facility''s security that could have been exploited. The issue has been addressed,\
  \ and the holding area remains secure.
response.2.WILD_STORIES.failure={0}, listening in didn''t yield useful intel, but it did let the\
  \ stories continue unchecked. The prisoners are starting to view the storyteller as a leader, and\
  \ his audience has grown. Guards are reporting a subtle shift in the holding area''s dynamics,\
  \ and there''s concern it could lead to trouble.

event.TAMPERING.message={0}, we caught a prisoner tampering with a vent in the holding cells. The\
  \ breach has been patched, but the prisoner insists it was "just for better air circulation." It\
  \ doesn''t add up, and we suspect they might''ve been testing security or planning something\
  \ more. Recommend reviewing footage and increasing patrols in the area. Let me know if we should\
  \ isolate or interrogate the prisoner further.
response.0.TAMPERING.button=Send a message
response.0.TAMPERING.tooltip=Punish the prisoner harshly to deter further attempts.
response.0.TAMPERING.success={0}, the prisoner was punished harshly, and the display of authority\
  \ has deterred further tampering. Guards report that the other prisoners seem intimidated, and\
  \ there have been no signs of additional security breaches. The situation appears to be under\
  \ control.
response.0.TAMPERING.failure={0}, punishing the prisoner harshly backfired. The rest of the\
  \ population viewed it as excessive, sparking outrage and minor disturbances in the holding area.\
  \ While the tampering has stopped, tensions are running high, and the guards are on edge.
response.1.TAMPERING.button=Move him to solitary
response.1.TAMPERING.tooltip=Quarantine the prisoner as a precaution.
response.1.TAMPERING.success={0}, the prisoner was moved to solitary confinement, and the holding\
  \ area has settled down. Guards report that removing him has lowered the risk of coordinated\
  \ tampering, and no further incidents have been observed. The facility is stable for now.
response.1.TAMPERING.failure={0}, moving the prisoner to solitary has only fueled rumors among the\
  \ population. Many believe he was punished unfairly, and whispers of unrest are spreading. Guards\
  \ are reporting increased hostility from the other prisoners, and tensions are rising.
response.2.TAMPERING.button=Let it slide, for now
response.2.TAMPERING.tooltip=There''s no harm done - this time.
response.2.TAMPERING.success={0}, the decision to let the incident slide has de-escalated the\
  \ situation. The prisoner has returned to their cell without further issue, and the holding area\
  \ is calm. Guards are keeping a close watch, but so far, there''s no indication of additional\
  \ tampering.
response.2.TAMPERING.failure={0}, letting the prisoner off the hook has emboldened the population.\
  \ Guards are reporting more frequent tampering attempts, and the holding area has grown more\
  \ chaotic. It''s clear the prisoners view the lack of consequences as a sign of weakness.

event.CONVERSATIONS.message={0}, my men have reported overhearing strange conversations among the\
  \ prisoners. One of them seems to be passing coded messages to others - nothing explicit, but\
  \ it''s clear they''re trying to keep it under the radar. We haven''t cracked what they''re\
  \ saying yet, but it might be worth isolating the suspected messenger and monitoring closely.\
  \ Advise on next steps.
response.0.CONVERSATIONS.button=Eavesdrop
response.0.CONVERSATIONS.tooltip=Assign a guard to decipher the code and gather intelligence.
response.0.CONVERSATIONS.success={0}, the guard assigned to monitor the conversations successfully\
  \ cracked the code. It appears the prisoners were attempting to coordinate a minor disruption,\
  \ but the plot was uncovered before it could be executed. The suspected prisoners have been\
  \ isolated, and the facility remains secure.
response.0.CONVERSATIONS.failure={0}, the attempt to monitor the prisoners failed. The coded\
  \ messages were too cryptic to decipher in time, and it''s clear the prisoners have become more\
  \ cautious. Guards are now reporting increased coordination among the population, indicating a\
  \ potential larger scheme.
response.1.CONVERSATIONS.button=Interrogate the ringleader
response.1.CONVERSATIONS.tooltip=Confront the suspected prisoner directly.
response.1.CONVERSATIONS.success={0}, the interrogation revealed the ringleader''s plans. They\
  \ admitted to attempting to organize a coordinated effort to disrupt the guards but folded under\
  \ pressure. The operation was dismantled, and the ringleader has been isolated. Order has been\
  \ restored in the holding area.
response.1.CONVERSATIONS.failure={0}, the interrogation yielded no useful information. The\
  \ ringleader refused to cooperate, and their defiance has only emboldened the other prisoners.\
  \ Guards report an uptick in suspicious behavior, and tensions in the holding area are rising.
response.2.CONVERSATIONS.button=Ignore it
response.2.CONVERSATIONS.tooltip=The guards are stretched thin - focus on bigger problems.
response.2.CONVERSATIONS.success={0}, ignoring the coded conversations seems to have been the right\
  \ call. Guards report no unusual behavior since, and the suspected ringleader has not attempted\
  \ further communication. The situation appears stable, and the holding area is calm for now.
response.2.CONVERSATIONS.failure={0}, ignoring the situation was a mistake. The prisoners used the\
  \ opportunity to coordinate more effectively, and guards are now reporting suspicious activity\
  \ across multiple sections of the facility. Whatever they were planning has likely escalated.

event.RATIONS.message={0}, we''ve got a situation with the prisoners complaining about the rations,\
  \ saying they''re insufficient. A handful of them have refused to eat and are demanding changes\
  \ before they cooperate. So far, it''s contained, but this could escalate if more prisoners join\
  \ in. Requesting guidance on how to proceed - do we negotiate, enforce compliance, or handle this\
  \ another way?
response.0.RATIONS.button=Give them extra rations
response.0.RATIONS.tooltip=Better-fed prisoners are less likely to cause problems.
response.0.RATIONS.success={0}, providing extra rations successfully defused the situation. The\
  \ prisoners are visibly calmer, and guards report that even the most vocal protestors have\
  \ resumed eating. While this approach taxed the supply line slightly, it has restored order in\
  \ the holding area.
response.0.RATIONS.failure={0}, the decision to provide extra rations backfired. The prisoners took\
  \ it as a sign of weakness, and now even more are making demands. Guards are struggling to\
  \ maintain control as the holding area grows increasingly restless.
response.1.RATIONS.button=Stick to the rules
response.1.RATIONS.tooltip=Rations are fine as they are. They''ll eat when they''re hungry enough.
response.1.RATIONS.success={0}, sticking to the established rations worked as intended. The\
  \ protesting prisoners have begun eating again, realizing their demands wouldn''t be met.\
  \ Guards report that tensions have eased, and the situation is back under control.
response.1.RATIONS.failure={0}, refusing to adjust the rations has escalated the conflict. More\
  \ prisoners are joining the protest, and several have started inciting unrest among the\
  \ population. Guards are reporting increased hostility, and the holding area is becoming\
  \ volatile.
response.2.RATIONS.button=Investigate the supply line
response.2.RATIONS.tooltip=Check with your quartermaster - are the prisoners being shorted?
response.2.RATIONS.success={0}, the investigation revealed that an issue in the supply chain was\
  \ indeed shorting the prisoners'' rations. Once corrected, the prisoners calmed down, and the\
  \ protest ended peacefully. The guards are now monitoring distribution to ensure this doesn''t\
  \ happen again.
response.2.RATIONS.failure={0}, the investigation revealed no discrepancies in the supply line, but\
  \ the delay in addressing the situation emboldened the prisoners. Guards report that tensions have\
  \ escalated, and the protest has spread to a larger portion of the population.

event.TRADE.message={0}, we''ve uncovered a growing contraband trade among the prisoners. They''re\
  \ exchanging messages, trinkets, and even scraps of clothing. So far, it looks harmless, but\
  \ the scale is increasing, and we''re concerned it might lead to something bigger. Recommend\
  \ stepping up inspections and confiscating the items before it becomes a larger security risk.\
  \ Awaiting your instructions.
response.0.TRADE.button=Confiscate everything
response.0.TRADE.tooltip=Shut the operation down and punish the traders.
response.0.TRADE.success={0}, the guards conducted a sweep of the holding area, confiscating all\
  \ contraband and punishing those involved in the trade. The operation sent a clear message, and\
  \ the prisoners seem deterred from further attempts. The holding area is secure, and order has\
  \ been restored.
response.0.TRADE.failure={0}, confiscating the contraband caused an uproar among the prisoners.\
  \ They viewed the operation as excessive and retaliated by organizing protests and refusing to \
  cooperate. Guards are reporting increased hostility, and tensions in the holding area are at a\
  \ breaking point.
response.1.TRADE.button=Turn a blind eye
response.1.TRADE.tooltip=Small trades keep them occupied and less likely to start trouble.
response.1.TRADE.success={0}, allowing the small trades to continue has kept the prisoners occupied\
  \ and relatively peaceful. Guards report no signs of escalation, and the contraband trade appears\
  \ to be more of a distraction than a threat. The holding area remains stable for now.
response.1.TRADE.failure={0}, ignoring the contraband trade backfired. The operation grew larger\
  \ and more organized, eventually leading to the discovery of weapons and tools that could pose a\
  \ serious security threat. The guards are now scrambling to contain the fallout from this\
  \ oversight.
response.2.TRADE.button=Control the market
response.2.TRADE.tooltip=Assign guards to oversee and profit from the contraband trade.
response.2.TRADE.success={0}, assigning guards to oversee the contraband trade allowed us to keep\
  \ the operation contained and under control. The prisoners are satisfied with their ability to\
  \ trade, and the guards are using the oversight to gather intelligence. The holding area is calm,\
  \ and no security risks have emerged.
response.2.TRADE.failure={0}, attempting to control the contraband market backfired. The guards''\
  \ involvement was discovered, leading to accusations of corruption from both prisoners and staff.\
  \ The resulting unrest has destabilized the holding area, and trust in our authority is eroding.

event.DRAINED.message={0}, one of my guards has reported feeling drained after extended shifts\
  \ managing the prisoners, particularly with the recent uptick in unruly behavior. Morale across\
  \ the security team seems to be slipping - some of the others are showing signs of frustration as\
  \ well. We may need to adjust the rotation schedule or provide some kind of support to prevent\
  \ burnout. Requesting guidance on how to proceed.
response.0.DRAINED.button=Give them a break
response.0.DRAINED.tooltip=Reassign guards temporarily to less stressful duties.
response.0.DRAINED.success={0}, reassigning guards to less stressful duties has worked wonders for\
  \ morale. The team appears more rested and capable of handling the challenges in the holding\
  \ area. The improved rotation schedule has restored order among the staff without compromising\
  \ security.
response.0.DRAINED.failure={0}, reassigning guards caused a staffing shortage in critical areas. The\
  \ reduced presence in the holding area emboldened the prisoners, and guards report an increase in\
  \ unruly behavior. Morale among the remaining staff has only worsened under the added pressure.
response.1.DRAINED.button=Boost morale
response.1.DRAINED.tooltip=Provide extra incentives, meals, or small comforts to improve morale.
response.1.DRAINED.success={0}, providing incentives like additional rest periods, better meals,\
  \ and small bonuses has revitalized the security team. The guards feel recognized for their\
  \ efforts, and morale has improved significantly. With spirits lifted, discipline has been\
  \ restored in the holding area.
response.1.DRAINED.failure={0}, the attempt to boost morale failed. The incentives were seen as too\
  \ little, too late, and some guards felt insulted by the gesture. Frustration continues to mount,\
  \ and discipline is slipping further. The holding area is becoming more volatile as the security\
  \ team struggles to stay focused.
response.2.DRAINED.button=Toughen them up
response.2.DRAINED.tooltip=Remind your team that discipline is part of the job.
response.2.DRAINED.success={0}, a firm reminder about discipline and duty has strengthened the\
  \ guards'' resolve. While the workload remains heavy, the team has stepped up to the challenge\
  \ and regained control of the holding area. Morale is holding steady, and order has been\
  \ maintained.
response.2.DRAINED.failure={0}, pushing the guards harder backfired. The team is now visibly\
  \ exhausted, and several guards have voiced resentment about the lack of support. Morale has\
  \ deteriorated further, and the risk of errors in the holding area is increasing rapidly.

event.RESCUE.message={0}, a prisoner is stirring up trouble in the holding area. They''ve been\
  \ loudly proclaiming that their "rescue is imminent," and it''s starting to catch the attention\
  \ of other prisoners. I''m concerned his defiance might inspire further unrest if we don''t\
  \ address it quickly. Recommend isolating him or taking measures to shut this down before it\
  \ escalates. Awaiting your orders.
response.0.RESCUE.button=Silence him
response.0.RESCUE.tooltip=Put the officer in solitary confinement to quiet his voice.
response.0.RESCUE.success={0}, the prisoner was moved to solitary confinement, cutting off his\
  \ ability to spread rumors. Without his influence, the holding area has calmed down. Guards\
  \ report that the remaining prisoners seem less agitated, and the risk of unrest has been\
  \ minimized.
response.0.RESCUE.failure={0}, moving the prisoner to solitary confinement only fueled the rumors.\
  \ The other prisoners now believe his claims even more strongly, assuming we''re trying to\
  \ silence the truth. Guards report increased hostility, and tensions in the holding area are on\
  \ the rise.
response.1.RESCUE.button=Debate him publicly
response.1.RESCUE.tooltip=Allow your officers to refute his claims in front of the prisoners.
response.1.RESCUE.success={0}, officers publicly refuted the prisoner''s claims, pointing out\
  \ inconsistencies in his story and challenging him to provide proof. The performance discredited\
  \ him in the eyes of the other prisoners, who have started ignoring his outbursts. The holding\
  \ area is stable once again.
response.1.RESCUE.failure={0}, the public debate backfired. The prisoner used the opportunity to rally\
  \ support, twisting the officers'' words to strengthen his narrative. The other prisoners seem\
  \ emboldened, and guards are struggling to contain the unrest spreading through the holding area.
response.2.RESCUE.button=Let him rant
response.2.RESCUE.tooltip=His words will ring hollow when no rescue arrives.
response.2.RESCUE.success={0}, allowing the prisoner to continue ranting proved effective. With no\
  \ rescue arriving, his claims began to sound hollow, and the other prisoners lost interest.\
  \ Guards report that the holding area has returned to normal, and the prisoner''s influence has\
  \ faded.
response.2.RESCUE.failure={0}, ignoring the prisoner''s outbursts was a mistake. His confidence and\
  \ persistence convinced the other prisoners that a rescue was indeed imminent. The population is\
  \ now agitated, and guards are reporting signs of coordinated unrest. The situation is\
  \ deteriorating.

event.REPAIRS.message={0}, one of the prisoners is claiming to have experience repairing combat\
  \ units. They''ve offered to assist in exchange for improved rations and better living conditions.\
  \ Could be an opportunity to make use of their skills, but there''s always the risk they''re\
  \ overstating their abilities - or worse, planning something. Recommend evaluating their\
  \ background and skills before making a decision. Let me know how you want to proceed.
response.0.REPAIRS.button=Use his skills
response.0.REPAIRS.tooltip=Allow him limited access to a workshop under heavy supervision.
response.0.REPAIRS.success={0}, the prisoner was granted limited access to the workshop under\
  \ strict supervision. It turns out his claims were genuine. He repaired several critical base\
  \ components, saving valuable time and resources. The guards reported no incidents, and the\
  \ operation was a success.
response.0.REPAIRS.failure={0}, allowing the prisoner into the workshop was a mistake. He sabotaged\
  \ several base components before being caught, leaving the equipment in worse condition than\
  \ before. The guards restrained him before he could do further damage, but the incident has raised\
  \ questions about our screening process.
response.1.REPAIRS.button=Keep him locked up
response.1.REPAIRS.tooltip=It''s too risky to trust a prisoner with that kind of access.
response.1.REPAIRS.success={0}, the decision to keep the prisoner locked up was prudent. Guards\
  \ later found compound schematics in his cell, indicating he was likely planning to sabotage our\
  \ systems rather than repair them. The holding area remains secure, and the situation is under\
  \ control.
response.1.REPAIRS.failure={0}, denying the prisoner access backfired. News of his offer spread\
  \ among the population, and now many prisoners are accusing us of wasting their talents. Tensions\
  \ in the holding area are rising, and guards are reporting an uptick in defiance and minor\
  \ disruptions.
response.2.REPAIRS.button=Test his knowledge
response.2.REPAIRS.tooltip=Ask him a series of questions to gauge his expertise.
response.2.REPAIRS.success={0}, the prisoner''s answers to the technical questions confirmed his\
  \ expertise. His knowledge appears to be legitimate, and granting him supervised access to the\
  \ workshop could be a safe way to capitalize on his skills. The guards report no unusual behavior\
  \ from him so far.
response.2.REPAIRS.failure={0}, the prisoner''s answers to the test were convincing at first, but upon\
  \ closer inspection, they were riddled with inaccuracies. It''s clear he was bluffing. Guards\
  \ report that the other prisoners are mocking him, and the holding area is calmer now that his\
  \ credibility has been shattered.

event.SICKNESS.message={0}, several prisoners have come down with unexplained symptoms - weakness,\
  \ coughing, and fatigue. I''m concerned it could spread, but the prisoners are blaming the\
  \ conditions in the holding cells. We''ve isolated the affected individuals for now, but we may\
  \ need to investigate further to rule out a larger issue. Requesting advice on next steps to\
  \ contain this and maintain order.
response.0.SICKNESS.button=Quarantine the sick
response.0.SICKNESS.tooltip=Prevent further spread by isolating the afflicted prisoners.
response.0.SICKNESS.success={0}, the quarantine was effective. The symptoms were contained to the\
  \ isolated group, and no new cases have emerged. Guards ensured the process was orderly, and the\
  \ holding area is stable. The prisoners seem to understand the necessity of the measure, and\
  \ tensions remain low.
response.0.SICKNESS.failure={0}, the quarantine caused a panic among the remaining prisoners, who\
  \ now fear they might be next. Guards report unrest in the holding area, with several prisoners\
  \ accusing us of neglect and inhumane treatment. The symptoms have begun appearing outside the\
  \ quarantine as well, suggesting it may have already spread.
response.1.SICKNESS.button=Improve their conditions
response.1.SICKNESS.tooltip=Allow better ventilation and clean water to improve health.
response.1.SICKNESS.success={0}, allowing better ventilation and providing clean water has\
  \ alleviated the symptoms. The affected prisoners are recovering, and the others seem more at\
  \ ease now that the conditions have been addressed. Guards report a noticeable improvement in\
  \ morale across the holding area.
response.1.SICKNESS.failure={0}, the effort to improve conditions was too little, too late. The\
  \ symptoms have continued to spread, and the remaining prisoners now view this as a sign of\
  \ weakness. Tensions are climbing in the holding area, and the guards are struggling to maintain\
  \ control.
response.2.SICKNESS.button=Wait it out
response.2.SICKNESS.tooltip=Let nature take its course - this could reduce the number of prisoners\
  \ causing trouble.
response.2.SICKNESS.success={0}, waiting it out proved to be the right decision. The symptoms\
  \ subsided on their own, and the affected prisoners have returned to their cells without further\
  \ incident. The guards have resumed normal operations, and the holding area remains stable.
response.2.SICKNESS.failure={0}, waiting it out was a disastrous decision. The illness spread rapidly,\
  \ overwhelming both the prisoners and the guards. The holding area is in chaos, and guards are\
  \ struggling to contain the unrest. Several prisoners have accused us of intentionally letting\
  \ this happen, further destabilizing the situation.

event.VETERAN.message={0}, we''ve got a situation involving one of the prisoners and a guard.\
  \ The prisoner recognized them from a previous campaign, and the two exchanged some tense words.\
  \ Sounds like there''s some unresolved history that could cause friction if it escalates.\
  \ Recommend keeping them separated for now and determining if this history poses a security risk.\
  \ Let me know how you want to handle it.
response.0.VETERAN.button=Let them sort it out
response.0.VETERAN.tooltip=Personal matters aren''t your concern.
response.0.VETERAN.success={0}, allowing the prisoner and the guard to handle it themselves\
  \ appears to have resolved the tension. The two exchanged a few more sharp words but ultimately\
  \ backed down without further incident. The holding area remains calm, and guards report no\
  \ additional issues.
response.0.VETERAN.failure={0}, letting them handle it themselves led to a serious confrontation.\
  \ The prisoner and the guard came to blows, forcing guards to intervene. Both parties are\
  \ injured, and the incident has stirred up unrest among the other prisoners, who now see the crew\
  \ as vulnerable.
response.1.VETERAN.button=Intervene and mediate
response.1.VETERAN.tooltip=Talk to both parties to resolve the issue.
response.1.VETERAN.success={0}, the mediation worked. Speaking with both parties defused the\
  \ tension, and they agreed to avoid further conflict. The guards are keeping a close watch, but\
  \ the situation appears resolved for now, and the holding area is stable.
response.1.VETERAN.failure={0}, the mediation attempt failed. The guard refused to let the\
  \ matter go, and the prisoner retaliated with accusations that stirred up anger among the\
  \ population. Tensions are rising in the holding area, and guards report that the prisoner is\
  \ trying to rally others against the crew.
response.2.VETERAN.button=Separate them immediately
response.2.VETERAN.tooltip=Avoid further conflict by assigning them to different areas.
response.2.VETERAN.success={0}, separating the prisoner and the guard has successfully\
  \ de-escalated the situation. Both parties have been reassigned to different areas, and guards\
  \ report no further interactions or signs of tension. The holding area is calm for now.
response.2.VETERAN.failure={0}, separating them only fueled the prisoner''s anger. They''ve started\

  \ becomin volatile.

event.GRAFFITI.message={0}, we''ve discovered crude graffiti on the walls of the holding cells.\
  \ It''s an unflattering depiction of you, accompanied by slogans promoting rebellion. While it''s\
  \ likely meant to rile up the other prisoners, it''s also a sign that tensions might be higher\
  \ than we realized. We''ve cleaned it up, but we recommend increased vigilance in the holding\
  \ area to prevent further incidents. Your guidance on next steps would be appreciated.
response.0.GRAFFITI.button=Clean it up
response.0.GRAFFITI.tooltip=Order the prisoners to scrub the walls themselves.
response.0.GRAFFITI.success={0}, the prisoners were ordered to scrub the walls themselves, and the\
  \ act of cleaning seems to have embarrassed and subdued them. Guards report that the prisoners\
  \ have been quieter since the incident, and no further graffiti has been discovered.
response.0.GRAFFITI.failure={0}, forcing the prisoners to clean up the graffiti sparked resentment.\
  \ They viewed it as a humiliation tactic and have grown even more defiant. Guards report an\
  \ uptick in mutterings about rebellion, and the holding area feels tense.
response.1.GRAFFITI.button=Ignore it
response.1.GRAFFITI.tooltip=A little art won''t hurt morale.
response.1.GRAFFITI.success={0}, ignoring the graffiti proved to be a wise decision. Without\
  \ attention, the prisoners lost interest in their ''art'' and moved on to other distractions.\
  \ Guards report no further incidents, and tensions in the holding area appear to be under control.
response.1.GRAFFITI.failure={0}, choosing to ignore the graffiti only emboldened the prisoners. New\
  \ slogans and drawings have appeared, spreading throughout the holding area and fostering a sense\
  \ of defiance among the population. Guards are now concerned about the growing unrest.
response.2.GRAFFITI.button=Investigate the source
response.2.GRAFFITI.tooltip=Question prisoners to find out who''s behind the graffiti.
response.2.GRAFFITI.success={0}, questioning the prisoners led to the identification of the\
  \ ringleader behind the graffiti. They''ve been isolated, and guards report that the incident has\
  \ not been repeated. The remaining prisoners appear more subdued now that the instigator has been\
  \ dealt with.
response.2.GRAFFITI.failure={0}, the investigation failed to uncover the responsible party, but it\
  \ did succeed in agitating the prisoners. They viewed the questioning as harassment, and tensions\
  \ in the holding area have increased. Guards are reporting a heightened sense of defiance among\
  \ the population.

event.PRAYER.message={0}, a group of prisoners has started holding loud, daily prayer sessions.\
  \ While they haven''t caused any direct trouble, the noise is disrupting the other prisoners, and\
  \ we''re beginning to see some friction between the groups. We can try to mediate or enforce\
  \ restrictions, but we''ll need your decision on how to proceed to avoid further conflicts.
response.0.PRAYER.button=Allow it
response.0.PRAYER.tooltip=Religious freedom shouldn''t be curtailed, as long as it doesn''t cause\
  \ problems.
response.0.PRAYER.success={0}, allowing the prayer sessions to continue has helped ease tensions\
  \ among the worshippers, and they''ve kept their behavior within acceptable limits. While some\
  \ prisoners still grumble about the noise, guards report that the overall mood in the holding\
  \ area is stable.
response.0.PRAYER.failure={0}, allowing the prayer sessions has led to increased friction in the\
  \ holding area. Non-participating prisoners are growing resentful, viewing the allowance as\
  \ favoritism. The conflict between the groups is escalating, and guards are struggling to\
  \ maintain order.
response.1.PRAYER.button=Move them elsewhere
response.1.PRAYER.tooltip=Set aside a space for their worship, away from the others.
response.1.PRAYER.success={0}, the decision to designate a separate space for worship has\
  \ successfully reduced the disruption in the main holding area. The worshippers are satisfied\
  \ with the arrangement, and the other prisoners seem calmer now that the noise is no longer an\
  \ issue. Guards report that the situation is under control.
response.1.PRAYER.failure={0}, moving the worshippers only created more tension. The other\
  \ prisoners viewed the allocation of a separate space as favoritism, and the worshippers\
  \ themselves complained about being isolated. Guards are reporting growing hostility between the\
  \ groups, and the situation is becoming volatile.
response.2.PRAYER.button=Ban it outright
response.2.PRAYER.tooltip=No religious practices on your watch - it''s too divisive.
response.2.PRAYER.success={0}, banning the prayer sessions has restored order to the holding area.\
  \ While the worshippers initially protested, they have since complied, and the friction with\
  \ other prisoners has subsided. Guards report a return to normal operations in the facility.
response.2.PRAYER.failure={0}, banning the prayer sessions backfired. The worshippers are furious\
  \ and have begun spreading dissent among the prisoners, accusing us of violating their rights.\
  \ The holding area is now rife with tension, and guards are reporting signs of escalating unrest.

event.BARTERING.message={0}, two prisoners were caught bartering a pack of cigarettes for what\
  \ appears to be "sensitive information" regarding our unit''s operations. I overheard parts of\
  \ the conversation, and it''s clear this isn''t just idle talk. We''ve separated the prisoners\
  \ for now, but we may need to interrogate them further to assess the severity of the breach.\
  \ Advise on how you want to handle this.
response.0.BARTERING.button=Confiscate everything
response.0.BARTERING.tooltip=Crack down on bartering and contraband trading.
response.0.BARTERING.success={0}, the contraband was confiscated, and a thorough sweep of the\
  \ holding area uncovered additional items tied to bartering activities. The crackdown has\
  \ disrupted their trading network, and guards report no further suspicious activity. The\
  \ situation appears contained.
response.0.BARTERING.failure={0}, confiscating contraband sparked an uproar among the prisoners.\
  \ They see it as an overreach, and tensions in the holding area are rising. Worse, the traders\
  \ clammed up, leaving us with no further insight into what information they were sharing. The\
  \ issue remains unresolved.
response.1.BARTERING.button=Interrogate them separately
response.1.BARTERING.tooltip=Find out what information they''re exchanging.
response.1.BARTERING.success={0}, interrogating the prisoners separately revealed critical details.\
  \ One prisoner admitted to passing outdated intel in exchange for contraband, but the information\
  \ poses no current threat to operations. The ringleaders have been isolated, and the guards\
  \ report no further incidents.
response.1.BARTERING.failure={0}, the separate interrogations failed. Both prisoners provided\
  \ conflicting stories, and now the rest of the population is suspicious of our methods. Guards\
  \ report whispers of conspiracy and growing hostility among the prisoners, making the holding\
  \ area increasingly volatile.
response.2.BARTERING.button=Let it slide
response.2.BARTERING.tooltip=It''s probably just rumors; no harm done.
response.2.BARTERING.success={0}, letting the incident go appears to have defused the situation\
  \ quietly. The prisoners involved have resumed their routines without further trouble, and guards\
  \ have detected no signs of continued bartering or information exchanges. The holding area\
  \ remains calm.
response.2.BARTERING.failure={0}, ignoring the situation was a mistake. Further investigation\
  \ revealed that sensitive operational details were indeed being passed along, and it''s unclear\
  \ how far this information has spread. The lapse in security has shaken morale among the guards,\
  \ and the risk of future breaches has increased.

event.OFFICER.message={0}, a captured officer is refusing to share quarters with enlisted\
  \ prisoners, saying it''s beneath their dignity. The enlisted prisoners are becoming agitated,\

  \ equal conditions or provide separate accommodations for the officer. Awaiting your orders.
response.0.OFFICER.button=Treat them equally
response.0.OFFICER.tooltip=Everyone gets the same conditions, no matter their rank.
response.0.OFFICER.success={0}, enforcing equal conditions for all prisoners has eased tensions\
  \ among the enlisted population. While the officer initially protested, they''ve since complied.\
  \ Guards report a noticeable decrease in hostility, and the holding area is stable once again.
response.0.OFFICER.failure={0}, forcing the officer to share quarters with the enlisted prisoners\
  \ backfired. The officer''s complaints have riled up the rest of the population, leading to\
  \ arguments and minor scuffles. Guards are reporting increased unrest, and the situation is\
  \ becoming harder to contain.
response.1.OFFICER.button=Give the officer his way
response.1.OFFICER.tooltip=Sometimes maintaining the chain of command keeps order.
response.1.OFFICER.success={0}, granting the officer separate accommodations appears to have\
  \ prevented further escalation. While the enlisted prisoners grumbled about it at first, they\
  \ seem to have accepted the decision. Guards report that the situation has calmed, and order is\
  \ holding in the holding area.
response.1.OFFICER.failure={0}, allowing the officer separate accommodations has worsened the\
  \ situation. The enlisted prisoners see it as blatant favoritism, and tensions have erupted into\
  \ open defiance. Guards are struggling to maintain control, and the holding area is on the verge\
  \ of chaos.
response.2.OFFICER.button=Use it to your advantage
response.2.OFFICER.tooltip=Subtly pit the groups against each other to keep them distracted.
response.2.OFFICER.success={0}, subtly encouraging division between the officer and the enlisted\
  \ prisoners has worked. The groups are too focused on their own arguments to organize against\
  \ the guards. The holding area is tense, but the distractions have kept the prisoners manageable\
  \ for now.
response.2.OFFICER.failure={0}, the attempt to exploit the tension backfired. The prisoners saw\
  \ through the manipulation and turned their frustration toward the guards. Guards report growing\
  \ hostility, and the holding area is now more unstable than ever.

event.DICE.message={0}, we''ve discovered some prisoners running a dice-based gambling game, using\
  \ scraps of cloth as currency. So far, it seems harmless, but we''re not sure if letting it\
  \ continue might lead to disputes or cause bigger problems later. Do you want us to shut it down\
  \ now or monitor it for the time being? Awaiting your guidance.
response.0.DICE.button=Break it up
response.0.DICE.tooltip=Gambling could lead to fights; it''s not worth the risk.
response.0.DICE.success={0}, the gambling operation was shut down swiftly. Guards confiscated the\
  \ dice and ''currency'' without incident, and the prisoners involved returned to their cells. The\
  \ holding area is calm, and no signs of tension have been observed since.
response.0.DICE.failure={0}, breaking up the gambling game caused an uproar. The prisoners accused\
  \ the guards of overstepping, and several have become openly defiant. The situation in the\
  \ holding area is now more volatile, with guards reporting an increase in tension and unrest.
response.1.DICE.button=Let it continue
response.1.DICE.tooltip=Harmless fun might keep morale from dropping too low.
response.1.DICE.success={0}, allowing the gambling game to continue has provided a harmless\
  \ distraction for the prisoners. Guards report that morale in the holding area has improved,\
  \ and no disputes have arisen. The situation remains stable, and the prisoners seem more\
  \ cooperative overall.
response.1.DICE.failure={0}, allowing the gambling game to continue led to trouble. A heated\
  \ dispute over winnings erupted into a physical fight, forcing guards to intervene. Several\
  \ prisoners were injured, and the holding area is now on edge. Guards are monitoring closely to\
  \ prevent further incidents.
response.2.DICE.button=Tax the winnings
response.2.DICE.tooltip=Use it as a way to assert control over the prisoners.
response.2.DICE.success={0}, the decision to tax the winnings has established control over the\
  \ gambling operation. The prisoners grudgingly accepted the arrangement, and the guards are\
  \ using the proceeds to maintain order. Tensions are low, and the holding area is running\
  \ smoothly.
response.2.DICE.failure={0}, attempting to tax the gambling operation backfired. The prisoners\
  \ accused the guards of exploitation, and the situation escalated into open defiance. Guards are\
  \ now struggling to maintain order, and the holding area is becoming increasingly unstable.

event.LOVERS.message={0}, one of my men has been observed chatting a bit too amicably with the\
  \ prisoners. Other guards are concerned this could lead to information leaks or compromise\
  \ security if the prisoners try to exploit the situation. We can address this with the guard\
  \ directly, but I''d appreciate your guidance on how to proceed to prevent any further risks.
response.0.LOVERS.button=Warn the guard
response.0.LOVERS.tooltip=A stern reminder to keep professional boundaries.
response.0.LOVERS.success={0}, the guard was given a stern warning about maintaining professional\
  \ boundaries. They acknowledged the concern and have adjusted their behavior accordingly. Guards\
  \ report no further issues, and the situation appears to be under control.
response.0.LOVERS.failure={0}, the warning seemed to have little effect. The guard''s interactions\
  \ with the prisoners have continued, and other guards are now voicing concerns about divided\
  \ loyalties. Tensions among the staff are rising, and security may be at risk.
response.1.LOVERS.button=Reassign them
response.1.LOVERS.tooltip=Move the guard to a different post to avoid further issues.
response.1.LOVERS.success={0}, the guard was reassigned to a different post, reducing their contact\
  \ with the prisoners. The transition was smooth, and the other guards have reported feeling more\
  \ confident about the security of the holding area. The issue appears resolved.
response.1.LOVERS.failure={0}, reassigning the guard created unintended friction among the team.\
  \ Some guards believe the reassignment was unfair, while others remain suspicious of the guard''s\
  \ intentions. The resulting discord has lowered morale and strained the security team.
response.2.LOVERS.button=Investigate further
response.2.LOVERS.tooltip=Is this a simple mistake, or is the guard being manipulated?
response.2.LOVERS.success={0}, the investigation revealed no malicious intent - just a lapse in\
  \ judgment. The guard has been counseled, and their interactions with the prisoners have returned\
  \ to a professional standard. The holding area is secure, and the guards'' concerns have been\
  \ eased.
response.2.LOVERS.failure={0}, the investigation uncovered evidence of manipulation by the\
  \ prisoners. It seems the guard was being coerced into providing minor favors, which could have\
  \ escalated if left unchecked. While the guard has been reassigned, the prisoners now seem\
  \ emboldened, and tensions are higher in the holding area.

event.SOBBING.message={0}, one of the prisoners has been sobbing uncontrollably during the night,\
  \ disturbing the others. Some prisoners are mocking the outburst, while others seem genuinely\
  \ concerned. The noise is starting to cause unrest in the holding cells. We can isolate the\
  \ prisoner for the sake of order or investigate further to determine if there''s something deeper\
  \ at play. Requesting your direction.
response.0.SOBBING.button=Leave them be
response.0.SOBBING.tooltip=This is not your problem to solve.
response.0.SOBBING.success={0}, leaving the prisoner alone allowed the situation to settle on its\
  \ own. The other prisoners eventually grew tired of the noise and stopped reacting to it. Guards\
  \ report that tensions in the holding area have eased, and order has been maintained.
response.0.SOBBING.failure={0}, ignoring the situation made things worse. The sobbing prisoner''s\
  \ behavior escalated, causing significant disruption in the holding area. Other prisoners began\
  \ to grow more restless, and the guards report increased hostility as a result of the disturbance.
response.1.SOBBING.button=Offer counseling
response.1.SOBBING.tooltip=Send in a MedTech or Guard to calm the prisoner.
response.1.SOBBING.success={0}, sending in a guard to speak with the prisoner calmed them down\
  \ significantly. It seems they were overwhelmed by fear and isolation, and the conversation\
  \ helped restore their composure. The holding area is quieter now, and tensions have eased.
response.1.SOBBING.failure={0}, the attempt at counseling failed. The prisoner became even more\
  \ distraught, claiming they couldn''t trust anyone. The visible turmoil has affected the other\
  \ prisoners, leading to heated arguments and unrest. Guards are struggling to maintain order in\
  \ the holding area.
response.2.SOBBING.button=Silence them
response.2.SOBBING.tooltip=Order the guards to restore order, no matter the method.
response.2.SOBBING.success={0}, the guards stepped in to restore order, and the sobbing prisoner\
  \ has been moved to a quieter area. While some prisoners muttered complaints, the intervention\
  \ stopped the disruption, and the holding area has returned to normal operations.
response.2.SOBBING.failure={0}, silencing the prisoner caused an uproar. The other prisoners saw it\
  \ as unnecessary cruelty, leading to widespread defiance and an increase in tension. Guards report\
  \ that the holding area is on edge, and the risk of further unrest has grown significantly.

event.PROPAGANDA.message={0}, we''ve discovered a stash of propaganda leaflets hidden among the\
  \ prisoners'' possessions. It''s unclear whether they''re being used to boost morale or as part\
  \ of an undercover effort. Either way, this could pose a risk if it spreads. We''ve confiscated\
  \ the materials for now, but we may need to interrogate the prisoners involved to determine\
  \ their intent. Let us know how you want to proceed.
response.0.PROPAGANDA.button=Destroy the leaflets
response.0.PROPAGANDA.tooltip=Eliminate the material before it spreads.
response.0.PROPAGANDA.success={0}, the leaflets were destroyed immediately. Guards made it clear\
  \ that such materials won''t be tolerated, and the prisoners seem to have taken the message\
  \ seriously. No further propaganda has been discovered, and the situation remains under control.
response.0.PROPAGANDA.failure={0}, destroying the leaflets only angered the prisoners. They''ve\
  \ started spreading rumors about suppression and retaliation, leading to increased tension in the\
  \ holding area. Guards are now reporting a rise in defiance and mutterings of rebellion.
response.1.PROPAGANDA.button=Interrogate the source
response.1.PROPAGANDA.tooltip=Find out who smuggled it in and why.
response.1.PROPAGANDA.success={0}, interrogating the prisoners involved uncovered the source of the\
  \ propaganda. It seems to have been smuggled in with supplies from outside. With this\
  \ information, we''ve secured the supply lines and prevented further incidents. The holding area\
  \ is stable.
response.1.PROPAGANDA.failure={0}, the interrogation didn''t yield any useful information. Instead,\
  \ it caused unrest among the prisoners, who now view it as an overreach. Guards report increased\
  \ hostility and a concerning rise in defiant behavior in the holding area.
response.2.PROPAGANDA.button=Allow it
response.2.PROPAGANDA.tooltip=Sometimes letting them keep small comforts prevents bigger problems.
response.2.PROPAGANDA.success={0}, allowing the prisoners to keep the leaflets seems to have defused\
  \ tension. Guards report that while the materials are circulating, they''re mostly being used as\
  \ morale boosters rather than anything subversive. The holding area remains calm, and order is\
  \ intact.
response.2.PROPAGANDA.failure={0}, allowing the leaflets to circulate was a mistake. The prisoners are\
  \ now rallying around the propaganda, using it to organize and spread anti-authority sentiments.\

response.1.SONGS.button=Let it continue
response.1.SONGS.tooltip=It''s just music - what harm could it do?
response.1.SONGS.success={0}, allowing the singing to continue seems to have had a positive effect.\
  \ The prisoners are calmer, and the unity displayed appears to be limited to boosting morale\
  \ rather than anything subversive. The holding area remains stable for now.
response.1.SONGS.failure={0}, letting the singing continue was a mistake. It has emboldened the\
  \ prisoners, who are now treating it as a form of defiance. Guards are reporting an increase in\
  \ coordinated behavior and suspect the songs are being used to send covert signals. The holding\
  \ area is becoming more tense.
response.2.SONGS.button=Use it for intel
response.2.SONGS.tooltip=Record the lyrics to see if they include hidden messages.
response.2.SONGS.success={0}, recording and analyzing the lyrics revealed a mix of nostalgic war\
  \ anthems and veiled references to past battles. Guards identified a subtle code within the\
  \ songs, allowing us to uncover a minor plot before it could be executed. The situation has been\
  \ diffused, and order remains intact.
response.2.SONGS.failure={0}, attempts to analyze the songs yielded no actionable intel. Meanwhile,\

response.0.REFUSE_RATIONS.button=Ignore it
response.0.REFUSE_RATIONS.tooltip=They''ll eat when they''re hungry enough.
response.0.REFUSE_RATIONS.success={0}, ignoring the refusal to eat proved effective. After a few\
  \ hours, the protesting prisoners gave up and resumed eating with no further incident. Guards\
  \ report that the rest of the population has remained calm, and the situation is back to normal.
response.0.REFUSE_RATIONS.failure={0}, ignoring the protest backfired. The hunger strike gained\

response.1.REFUSE_RATIONS.button=Negotiate
response.1.REFUSE_RATIONS.tooltip=Speak to the ringleader and see what they want.
response.1.REFUSE_RATIONS.success={0}, speaking with the ringleader revealed the root of their\
  \ complaints. Minor adjustments to rations and living conditions were enough to defuse the\
  \ situation, and the prisoners have resumed eating. The holding area is calm, and guards report\
  \ no further unrest.
response.1.REFUSE_RATIONS.failure={0}, the negotiation attempt failed. The ringleader used the\

  \ more volatile.
response.2.REFUSE_RATIONS.button=Force-feed them
response.2.REFUSE_RATIONS.tooltip=Demonstrate that resistance won''t work here.
response.2.REFUSE_RATIONS.success={0}, the guards demonstrated clear authority, and the prisoners''\
  \ resistance quickly crumbled. While the act of force-feeding them was unpleasant, it sent a\
  \ strong message that defiance wouldn''t be tolerated. The rest of the population has remained\
  \ compliant, and the holding area is stable.
response.2.REFUSE_RATIONS.failure={0}, force-feeding the prisoners enraged the population. The act\
  \ was seen as unnecessarily cruel, leading to widespread resentment and open hostility among the\
  \ prisoners. Guards are reporting an increase in coordinated defiance, and the situation is\
  \ deteriorating rapidly.

event.PLOTTING.message={0}, one of my guards overheard prisoners talking about "the perfect time" to make\
  \ a break for it. While it might just be idle chatter, it''s enough to make the team uneasy. We''ve\
  \ increased vigilance for now, but it might be worth interrogating the prisoners involved or\
  \ stepping up security measures. Let us know how you''d like to proceed.
response.0.PLOTTING.button=Tighten security
response.0.PLOTTING.tooltip=Increase patrols and inspections.
response.0.PLOTTING.success={0}, increasing patrols and inspections proved effective. Guards discovered\
  \ and confiscated makeshift tools hidden among the prisoners'' belongings, possibly intended for\
  \ an escape attempt. The heightened security has deterred further planning, and the holding area\
  \ is secure.
response.0.PLOTTING.failure={0}, tightening security agitated the prisoners, who view the increased\

response.1.PLOTTING.button=Interrogate the leaders
response.1.PLOTTING.tooltip=Find out who''s behind the whispers.
response.1.PLOTTING.success={0}, interrogating the suspected leaders revealed valuable intelligence. It\
  \ appears the prisoners were testing the guards'' reactions and probing for weak spots. The\
  \ ringleaders have been isolated, and the guards are now better prepared to prevent any attempts\
  \ at escape.
response.1.PLOTTING.failure={0}, the interrogation yielded no actionable information, but it caused\
  \ significant unrest among the prisoners. Many are now openly accusing the guards of unfair\
  \ treatment, and tensions in the holding area are escalating rapidly.
response.2.PLOTTING.button=Ignore it
response.2.PLOTTING.tooltip=Idle talk doesn''t mean a real threat.
response.2.PLOTTING.success={0}, ignoring the chatter turned out to be the right decision. The talk of\
  \ a breakout was just idle banter, and the prisoners eventually moved on to other distractions.\
  \ Guards report no signs of unusual activity, and the holding area remains calm.
response.2.PLOTTING.failure={0}, ignoring the chatter was a mistake. A coordinated escape attempt was\
  \ uncovered too late, and while the prisoners were caught before breaking out, the breach has\
  \ shaken the guards'' confidence. The holding area is now unstable, and tensions are at an\
  \ all-time high.

event.EQUIPMENT.message={0}, a piece of surveillance equipment in the holding area has been found\

response.1.EQUIPMENT.tooltip=It''s not worth the resources to dig into this.
response.1.EQUIPMENT.success={0}, the decision to repair the equipment without further action seems\
  \ to have paid off. Guards report no further tampering, and the situation in the holding area\
  \ remains calm. It appears this was an isolated incident.
response.1.EQUIPMENT.failure={0}, ignoring the incident has backfired. The prisoners have started\

  \ scrambling to address multiple points of sabotage, and tensions are escalating.
response.2.EQUIPMENT.button=Punish them all
response.2.EQUIPMENT.tooltip=Make the prisoners understand sabotage will not be tolerated.
response.2.EQUIPMENT.success={0}, the collective punishment sent a clear message. The prisoners are\
  \ subdued, and guards report no further incidents of tampering. The holding area is tense, but\
  \ order has been maintained for now.
response.2.EQUIPMENT.failure={0}, punishing the entire population has caused significant unrest.\

response.0.PLANNED_RESCUE.tooltip=Announce that no rescue is coming and spread doubt.
response.0.PLANNED_RESCUE.success={0}, announcing that no rescue was coming successfully sowed\

  \ population, and the overall mood has stabilized. Guards report no further disruptions, and\
  \ order has been maintained.
response.0.PLANNED_RESCUE.failure={0}, calling their bluff backfired. The prisoners interpreted the\
  \ announcement as a desperate attempt to suppress the truth. Hope has spread like wildfire, and\
  \ tensions in the holding area have escalated sharply. Guards are reporting signs of increased\
  \ coordination among the prisoners.
response.1.PLANNED_RESCUE.button=Interrogate the prisoner
response.1.PLANNED_RESCUE.tooltip=Find out if there''s any truth to the claim.
response.1.PLANNED_RESCUE.success={0}, interrogating the prisoner revealed the claim to be\
  \ baseless. The prisoner admitted to fabricating the story to raise morale among their comrades.\
  \ The guards have since discredited the claim among the prisoners, and the holding area is calm\
  \ once again.
response.1.PLANNED_RESCUE.failure={0}, the interrogation yielded no clear answers, but it further\
  \ emboldened the prisoners. They now view the prisoner as a symbol of resistance, rallying behind\
  \ their defiance. Guards are reporting a noticeable rise in unrest throughout the holding area.
response.2.PLANNED_RESCUE.button=Prepare defenses
response.2.PLANNED_RESCUE.tooltip=Just in case, increase security in key areas.
response.2.PLANNED_RESCUE.success={0}, reinforcing security measures proved prudent. While no\
  \ rescue attempt materialized, the show of force has deterred further defiance among the\
  \ prisoners. Guards report that the population is more subdued, and the holding area is secure.
response.2.PLANNED_RESCUE.failure={0}, increasing security measures had the unintended effect of\
  \ validating the prisoner''s claims in the eyes of the prisoners. They believe the additional\
  \ defenses are proof that a rescue is imminent, and tensions are now at an all-time high. Guards\
  \ are struggling to maintain control.

event.MISTAKE.message={0}, one of the prisoners is insisting they were captured by mistake,\
  \ claiming to be a civilian rather than a soldier. Their story sounds plausible, but we currently\
  \ have no way to verify it. This could be an attempt to manipulate us, or it might genuinely\
  \ warrant further investigation. Requesting guidance on how to proceed - whether to interrogate\
  \ further, hold them, or escalate the matter.
response.0.MISTAKE.button=Hold them anyway
response.0.MISTAKE.tooltip=You can''t take any chances - they stay with the others.
response.0.MISTAKE.success={0}, the decision to hold the prisoner has prevented potential security\
  \ risks. Guards report no further incidents, and the prisoner seems resigned to their situation.\
  \ The holding area remains calm, and the rest of the population appears unaffected by the\
  \ decision.
response.0.MISTAKE.failure={0}, holding the prisoner without investigating has caused unrest. Some\
  \ prisoners have started questioning the fairness of their treatment, and guards report growing\
  \ tensions in the holding area. The situation may escalate if this issue isn''t addressed.
response.1.MISTAKE.button=Investigate their claim
response.1.MISTAKE.tooltip=Assign someone to verify their story, if possible.
response.1.MISTAKE.success={0}, the investigation confirmed the prisoner''s story - they are indeed\
  \ a civilian. The prisoner has been moved to more appropriate accommodations, and the other\
  \ prisoners seem less agitated now that the issue was handled fairly. The holding area remains\
  \ stable.
response.1.MISTAKE.failure={0}, the investigation turned up no evidence to support the prisoner''s\
  \ claim, but the time it took emboldened the rest of the population. Guards report whispers of\
  \ manipulation and growing defiance among the prisoners, making the holding area increasingly\
  \ unstable.
response.2.MISTAKE.button=Move them to better quarters
response.2.MISTAKE.tooltip=You can''t risk freeing them.
response.2.MISTAKE.success={0}, moving the prisoner to better quarters seems to have defused the\
  \ immediate tension. The other prisoners took note of the gesture, and the holding area remains\
  \ calm. Guards report no further issues, though the situation is being monitored closely.
response.2.MISTAKE.failure={0}, moving the prisoner caused significant backlash. The rest of the\
  \ population now views this as favoritism, and guards report increased hostility in the holding\
  \ area. The situation has become more volatile, and the risk of unrest is growing.

event.LETTER.message={0}, I''ve just intercepted a letter from a prisoner, written entirely in\
  \ code. It''s addressed to someone outside the facility, but we haven''t been able to determine\
  \ its contents yet. This could be an attempt to coordinate with outside forces or something less\
  \ significant. We recommend decoding the message immediately and monitoring the prisoner''s\
  \ communications more closely. Awaiting your instructions
response.0.LETTER.button=Decode it
response.0.LETTER.tooltip=Assign a specialist to figure out what it says.
response.0.LETTER.success={0}, the code was successfully cracked, revealing plans for a coordinated\
  \ escape attempt. The information allowed us to intercept key communications and isolate the\
  \ involved prisoners. The holding area is secure, and guards are on heightened alert.
response.0.LETTER.failure={0}, despite our best efforts, the code couldn''t be cracked in time. The\
  \ contents remain a mystery, and tensions are rising as the other prisoners sense increased guard\
  \ activity. This may have emboldened the population, and the situation remains unstable.
response.1.LETTER.button=Burn it
response.1.LETTER.tooltip=Eliminate the letter without risking the contents getting out.
response.1.LETTER.success={0}, the letter was destroyed immediately, ensuring its contents won''t\
  \ reach the intended recipient. While the prisoner expressed frustration, no further incidents\
  \ have occurred. The holding area remains under control, and the risk of external coordination\
  \ has been neutralized.
response.1.LETTER.failure={0}, burning the letter seems to have backfired. The prisoner''s reaction\
  \ was extreme, and they''ve begun spreading claims that we''re hiding something from the\
  \ population. Tensions in the holding area have increased, and guards report growing unrest among\
  \ the prisoners.
response.2.LETTER.button=Deliver it
response.2.LETTER.tooltip=Send it to the intended recipient to see what happens.
response.2.LETTER.success={0}, delivering the letter led to an unexpected breakthrough. By\
  \ monitoring the recipient, we uncovered a small network of operatives outside the facility. With\
  \ this information, we''ve taken measures to neutralize the threat. The holding area remains\
  \ stable.
response.2.LETTER.failure={0}, delivering the letter turned out to be a major risk. The recipient\
  \ was alerted and may have used the contents to plan further subversive actions. The holding area\
  \ remains tense, and guards are preparing for potential repercussions from outside forces.

event.ILLNESS.message={0}, several prisoners are claiming they''ve come down with a highly\
  \ contagious local illness. We can''t confirm the legitimacy of their symptoms yet, but we''re\

  \ precautions to prevent an outbreak. Awaiting your orders.
response.0.ILLNESS.button=Quarantine them
response.0.ILLNESS.tooltip=Separate the prisoners to protect your crew.
response.0.ILLNESS.success={0}, the quarantine was effective. Any potential illness has been\
  \ contained, and no symptoms have appeared among the crew or other prisoners. The isolated\
  \ prisoners seem to be recovering, and guards report that the holding area is stable.
response.0.ILLNESS.failure={0}, the quarantine caused unrest among the prisoners, who now believe\
  \ they''re being unfairly punished. Tensions have risen sharply, and guards report increased\
  \ defiance. To make matters worse, symptoms are now spreading to other parts of the holding area.
response.1.ILLNESS.button=Call their bluff
response.1.ILLNESS.tooltip=Assume it''s a ploy and take no action.
response.1.ILLNESS.success={0}, assuming it was a ploy proved correct. The prisoners eventually\
  \ admitted to faking the symptoms in an attempt to gain better treatment. Guards report that the\
  \ holding area has returned to normal, and no further incidents have occurred.
response.1.ILLNESS.failure={0}, ignoring the claims backfired. What was thought to be a bluff\
  \ turned out to be a legitimate illness, and symptoms have begun spreading to other prisoners and\
  \ guards. The situation is deteriorating, and guards are scrambling to prevent a full-blown\
  \ outbreak.
response.2.ILLNESS.button=Bring in medical support
response.2.ILLNESS.tooltip=Treat the prisoners to ensure safety.
response.2.ILLNESS.success={0}, bringing in medical personnel confirmed the illness was genuine but\
  \ minor. The affected prisoners were treated quickly, and the rest of the population was\
  \ reassured by the proactive response. Guards report improved morale, and the holding area\
  \ remains secure.
response.2.ILLNESS.failure={0}, the arrival of medical personnel caused chaos. Some prisoners\
  \ attempted to exploit the situation to gain better conditions, while others accused the staff\
  \ of experimenting on them. Tensions in the holding area are escalating, and guards are reporting\
  \ a surge in hostility.

event.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.message={0}, one of the prisoners just handed me a\
  \ folded piece of paper shaped like a unicorn. It appears harmless, but the gesture feels oddly\
  \ symbolic, and we''re unsure how to interpret it. This could be a message, a distraction, or\
  \ just an unusual display of creativity. We''ll keep an eye on the prisoner for any further\
  \ behavior, but let us know if you want us to take any specific actions.
response.0.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.button=Destroy it
response.0.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.tooltip=It''s just paper, but better safe than sorry.
response.0.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.success={0}, the paper unicorn was destroyed\
  \ without incident. While the prisoner seemed mildly displeased, no further strange behavior has\
  \ been observed. Guards report that the holding area remains calm, and the matter appears\
  \ resolved.
response.0.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.failure={0}, destroying the paper unicorn agitated\
  \ the prisoner and sparked curiosity among the others. Whispers about hidden messages and\

  \ holding area.
response.1.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.button=Ask what it means
response.1.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.tooltip=Speak to the prisoner and understand their\
  \ intentions.
response.1.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.success={0}, speaking with the prisoner revealed\
  \ the unicorn was simply a gesture of peace and creativity. The explanation eased any concerns,\
  \ and the interaction seemed to foster a sense of calm among the prisoners. The holding area is\
  \ stable, and no further incidents have occurred.
response.1.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.failure={0}, the prisoner refused to explain the\
  \ unicorn''s meaning, claiming, "You''ll understand in time." This cryptic response has unnerved\
  \ the guards and sparked rumors among the prisoners. Tensions in the holding area are rising, and\
  \ the situation feels increasingly uneasy.
response.2.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.button=Keep it as a curiosity
response.2.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.tooltip=Add it to your collection of oddities.
response.2.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.success={0}, the paper unicorn was added to your\
  \ collection of oddities, and the prisoner seemed pleased that their creation was appreciated.\
  \ Guards report that the gesture has had a calming effect on the holding area, and the other\
  \ prisoners appear less agitated.
response.2.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.failure={0}, keeping the paper unicorn as a\
  \ curiosity has caused unease among the prisoners. Many believe it''s being analyzed for hidden\
  \ meaning, and the prisoner who made it has become oddly withdrawn. The holding area feels tense,\
  \ and guards are reporting subtle shifts in behavior.

event.HEAVY_METAL.message={0}, the other guards have reported hearing strange metallic noises\
  \ coming from the holding area during the night. We haven''t identified the source yet, but it''s\
  \ unusual enough to raise concerns. It could be something innocuous, like environmental issues,\
  \ or something deliberate, like tampering or preparations for escape. Recommend conducting a\
  \ thorough inspection of the area to ensure everything is secure. Awaiting your guidance.
response.0.HEAVY_METAL.button=Inspect the cells
response.0.HEAVY_METAL.tooltip=Search thoroughly for contraband or escape attempts.
response.0.HEAVY_METAL.success={0}, the inspection revealed a hidden stash of makeshift tools and\
  \ partially loosened bolts on one of the vents. The contraband was confiscated, and the prisoners\
  \ involved have been isolated. Guards report that the holding area is secure, and no further\
  \ noises have been heard.
response.0.HEAVY_METAL.failure={0}, the inspection turned up nothing unusual, but the process\
  \ caused unrest among the prisoners. They''re now accusing the guards of harassment, and tensions\
  \ in the holding area have increased. Guards report more hostility from the population.
response.1.HEAVY_METAL.button=Ignore it
response.1.HEAVY_METAL.tooltip=It''s probably just the old ventilation system.
response.1.HEAVY_METAL.success={0}, ignoring the noises proved to be the right call. The sound was\
  \ traced to an aging ventilation duct, which has since stopped making noise. Guards report that\
  \ the  holding area is calm, and no further incidents have occurred.
response.1.HEAVY_METAL.failure={0}, ignoring the noises was a mistake. A hidden escape tunnel was\
  \ discovered too late, and several prisoners were caught trying to break through. While the\
  \ attempt was thwarted, the incident has shaken the guards'' confidence, and tensions are rising\
  \ in the holding area.
response.2.HEAVY_METAL.button=Set a trap
response.2.HEAVY_METAL.tooltip=Use the noise to lure out whoever is causing it.
response.2.HEAVY_METAL.success={0}, the guards set a trap, quietly monitoring the source of the\
  \ noises. They successfully caught two prisoners tampering with a vent during the night. The\
  \ prisoners have been isolated, and their tools confiscated. The holding area is stable, and no\
  \ further incidents have been reported.
response.2.HEAVY_METAL.failure={0}, the attempt to set a trap failed. Whoever was causing the\
  \ noises appears to have caught on and stopped before revealing themselves. Guards are left\
  \ uneasy, and the holding area is tense with rumors of an organized plot among the prisoners.

event.PARANOIA.message={0}, one of the prisoners is growing increasingly agitated, insisting that\
  \ someone is going to kill them. While there''s no evidence to support their claim, their\
  \ paranoia is beginning to disrupt the other prisoners. This could escalate if not addressed.\
  \ Recommend monitoring the prisoner closely and deciding whether to confront or attempt to calm\
  \ them down. Let us know how you''d like to proceed.
response.0.PARANOIA.button=Humor them
response.0.PARANOIA.tooltip=Assign a guard to reassure the prisoner.
response.0.PARANOIA.success={0}, a guard was assigned to reassure the prisoner, carefully\
  \ addressing their concerns without validating the paranoia. This approach calmed the prisoner,\
  \ and their disruptive behavior has subsided. Guards report that the holding area is stable, and\
  \ tensions are low.
response.0.PARANOIA.failure={0}, humoring the prisoner only fueled their paranoia. They now believe\
  \ the guard is part of a conspiracy, and their agitation has spread to a small group of\
  \ prisoners. Guards are reporting increased tension in the holding area as rumors take hold.
response.1.PARANOIA.button=Isolate them
response.1.PARANOIA.tooltip=Remove them before their paranoia spreads.
response.1.PARANOIA.success={0}, isolating the prisoner successfully prevented their paranoia from\
  \ spreading. While they remain agitated, the rest of the holding area is calm, and guards report\
  \ no further disruptions. The situation is under control for now.
response.1.PARANOIA.failure={0}, isolating the prisoner caused unrest among the population. Other\
  \ prisoners are now questioning the guards'' motives, suspecting foul play. Tensions have risen,\
  \ and guards are struggling to keep order in the holding area.
response.2.PARANOIA.button=Ignore their claims
response.2.PARANOIA.tooltip=Paranoia is just a side effect of captivity.
response.2.PARANOIA.success={0}, ignoring the prisoner''s claims allowed the situation to resolve\
  \ itself. Over time, their paranoia subsided, and the other prisoners have largely dismissed\
  \ their outbursts. Guards report no further disruptions, and the holding area is calm.
response.2.PARANOIA.failure={0}, ignoring the prisoner''s paranoia was a mistake. Their disruptive\
  \ behavior escalated, and they''ve convinced others to believe their claims. The holding area is\
  \ now rife with tension, and guards report signs of growing unrest among the population.

event.TUNNEL.message={0}, we''ve discovered a half-dug tunnel hidden beneath one of the bunks in the\
  \ holding area. It''s unclear how long they''ve been working on it or how many prisoners are\
  \ involved. We''ve sealed the area for now, but this suggests a coordinated escape attempt.\
  \ Recommend conducting a full sweep of the facility and interrogating key prisoners to uncover\
  \ the extent of the plan. Awaiting your orders.
response.0.TUNNEL.button=Collapse the tunnel
response.0.TUNNEL.tooltip=Seal it up and monitor the area.
response.0.TUNNEL.success={0}, the tunnel was collapsed and sealed off, sending a clear message to\
  \ the prisoners. Guards have been stationed in the area to ensure no further digging occurs. The\
  \ holding area remains secure, and no additional escape attempts have been reported.
response.0.TUNNEL.failure={0}, collapsing the tunnel angered the prisoners. They saw it as a\
  \ provocation and are now more defiant than ever. Guards report increased hostility, and tensions\
  \ in the holding area are dangerously high.
response.1.TUNNEL.button=Find the diggers
response.1.TUNNEL.tooltip=Interrogate prisoners to determine who''s responsible.
response.1.TUNNEL.success={0}, interrogating key prisoners revealed the identities of those involved\
  \ in the escape plan. The ringleaders have been isolated, and the remaining prisoners seem\
  \ subdued. Guards report no further signs of coordination, and the holding area is stable.
response.1.TUNNEL.failure={0}, the interrogations yielded no useful information, but they have\
  \ significantly agitated the prisoners. Accusations of harassment are spreading, and tensions in\
  \ the holding area have escalated. Guards are now dealing with increased defiance.
response.2.TUNNEL.button=Leave it open
response.2.TUNNEL.tooltip=Use it as bait to catch escapees in the act.
response.2.TUNNEL.success={0}, leaving the tunnel open allowed guards to catch the diggers in the\
  \ act during the night. The prisoners involved were detained, and their tools confiscated. The\
  \ holding area is now secure, and guards are closely monitoring the situation.
response.2.TUNNEL.failure={0}, leaving the tunnel open backfired. The prisoners outmaneuvered the\
  \ guards and used the tunnel to attempt an escape. While they were eventually stopped, the\
  \ incident has emboldened the rest of the population, and tensions in the holding area are now\
  \ dangerously high.

event.PET_RODENT.message={0}, one of the prisoners appears to have tamed a small rodent that''s\

response.0.PET_RODENT.button=Allow it
response.0.PET_RODENT.tooltip=Small comforts might keep morale stable.
response.0.PET_RODENT.success={0}, allowing the prisoner to keep the rodent seems to have improved\
  \ morale. Guards report that the prisoners are calmer, and no signs of contraband or messages\
  \ have been detected. The holding area remains stable, and the situation appears harmless for\
  \ now.
response.0.PET_RODENT.failure={0}, allowing the rodent proved to be a mistake. Guards later\

  \ We're impressed, but the incident has undermined security, and we're scrambling to recover\
  \ the smuggled items.
response.1.PET_RODENT.button=Confiscate the animal
response.1.PET_RODENT.tooltip=The prisoners can''t have unauthorized "pets."
response.1.PET_RODENT.success={0}, the rodent was removed without incident. While the prisoner was\
  \ clearly upset, the rest of the population seems indifferent, and guards report no further\
  \ issues. The holding area remains secure, and morale has stabilized.
response.1.PET_RODENT.failure={0}, confiscating the rodent caused unexpected backlash. The prisoners\
  \ viewed the act as unnecessarily cruel, and tensions in the holding area have increased. Guards\
  \ are now dealing with minor disturbances and defiant behavior.
response.2.PET_RODENT.button=Set traps
response.2.PET_RODENT.tooltip=Get rid of all vermin for good.
response.2.PET_RODENT.success={0}, setting traps eliminated the rodent problem entirely. Guards\
  \ report no further sightings of vermin, and the holding area remains secure. While some\
  \ prisoners grumbled about the decision, the overall mood has stabilized, and no further issues\
  \ have arisen.
response.2.PET_RODENT.failure={0}, setting traps caused significant unrest among the prisoners, who\

  \ further contraband has been discovered during follow-up inspections. The situation is under\
  \ control.
response.0.ESCAPE_ROPE.failure={0}, punishing the prisoners caused widespread backlash. The rest of\

response.1.ESCAPE_ROPE.button=Confiscate it quietly
response.1.ESCAPE_ROPE.tooltip=Avoid stirring up unrest.
response.1.ESCAPE_ROPE.success={0}, the rope-like contraband was confiscated quietly, avoiding\
  \ unnecessary attention. Guards have increased patrols and monitoring, and no further suspicious\
  \ behavior has been observed. The holding area remains stable, and morale is unaffected.
response.1.ESCAPE_ROPE.failure={0}, confiscating the contraband quietly wasn''t enough. The\

  \ items being passed around. The holding area is growing tenser, and the risk of further\
  \ attempts is increasing.
response.2.ESCAPE_ROPE.button=Reward the guard
response.2.ESCAPE_ROPE.tooltip=Praise them for catching the attempt early.
response.2.ESCAPE_ROPE.success={0}, rewarding the guard for their vigilance boosted morale among\

  \ have risen sharply, and guards are reporting increased hostility from the population.

event.UNDERCOVER.message={0}, one of the prisoners is claiming to be an undercover agent working\

  \ might warrant further investigation. Recommend verifying their claim through proper channels or\
  \ keeping them under close watch until we know more. Let us know how you''d like to proceed.
response.0.UNDERCOVER.button=Verify their claim
response.0.UNDERCOVER.tooltip=Check their story against your records.
response.0.UNDERCOVER.success={0}, verification through Command confirmed the prisoner''s identity\
  \ as an undercover agent. They''ve been quietly removed from the holding area for debriefing.\
  \ Guards are maintaining their vigilance, but the situation remains calm.
response.0.UNDERCOVER.failure={0}, attempts to verify the prisoner''s story yielded no matching\
  \ records. The prisoner continues to insist on their role, but it''s clear they''ve fabricated\
  \ the claim. Guards report increased distrust from the other prisoners, who now see the situation\
  \ as a ploy by the staff.
response.1.UNDERCOVER.button=Dismiss them
response.1.UNDERCOVER.tooltip=It''s probably just a ploy for better treatment.
response.1.UNDERCOVER.success={0}, dismissing the prisoner''s claims seems to have defused the\
  \ situation. They''ve stopped insisting on their supposed status, and the other prisoners appear\
  \ to view it as a failed attempt at manipulation. Guards report that the holding area remains\
  \ stable.
response.1.UNDERCOVER.failure={0}, dismissing the claim was a grave mistake. The prisoner was, in\
  \ fact, an undercover agent and the other prisoners must have uncovered the truth. The agent was\
  \ found dead in their cell and the situation in the holding area is rapidly deteriorating.
response.2.UNDERCOVER.button=Put them to the test.
response.2.UNDERCOVER.tooltip=See if they have actionable intel.
response.2.UNDERCOVER.success={0}, the prisoner provided actionable intel as a way to prove their\
  \ identity. An allied operation confirmed the information''s accuracy, and we're in a better\
  \ position tactically than we were prior to the debriefing. Guards are now keeping the situation\
  \ quiet to avoid exposing the agent. The holding area remains secure.
response.2.UNDERCOVER.failure={0}, the prisoner''s so-called "intel" turned out to be false. The\
  \ deception has frustrated guards and created confusion among our forces. We're in a worse\
  \ position tactically than we were prior to the debriefing, but the holding area remains secure.

event.BRAND.message={0}, we''ve discovered a prisoner with a fresh burn scar in the shape of their\

  \ and keeping an eye on their interactions. Let us know if further action is needed.
response.0.BRAND.button=Investigate
response.0.BRAND.tooltip=Who branded them, and why?
response.0.BRAND.success={0}, the investigation revealed that the scar was self-inflicted as a show\
  \ of loyalty. While the act inspired some prisoners, guards have increased monitoring of the\
  \ prisoner''s interactions, preventing any further incidents. The holding area remains stable for\
  \ now.
response.0.BRAND.failure={0}, the investigation caused unrest among the prisoners, who viewed it as\
  \ an invasion of their personal matters. Tensions in the holding area have escalated, and guards\
  \ report increased hostility from the population. The branded prisoner is now seen as a martyr\
  \ by their peers.
response.1.BRAND.button=Treat the wound
response.1.BRAND.tooltip=Ensure they receive medical attention.
response.1.BRAND.success={0}, the wound was treated by medical personnel, and the gesture seems to\
  \ have calmed the prisoner and those around them. Guards report that the holding area is more\
  \ subdued, and the prisoner''s interactions with others are being closely monitored without\
  \ incident.
response.1.BRAND.failure={0}, treating the wound led to accusations of favoritism from the other\
  \ prisoners. Many now see the branded individual as a symbol of resistance, and tensions in the\
  \ holding area have increased. Guards are reporting signs of coordination among the population.
response.2.BRAND.button=Ignore it
response.2.BRAND.tooltip=Let the prisoners handle their own business.
response.2.BRAND.success={0}, ignoring the incident has allowed the situation to settle naturally.\
  \ While the branding initially caused a stir, the other prisoners lost interest over time, and\
  \ the holding area has returned to a stable state. Guards are monitoring for any further signs\
  \ of unrest
response.2.BRAND.failure={0}, ignoring the branding was a mistake. The prisoner has gained\
  \ significant influence among their peers, who now view the act as a rallying point. Guards\
  \ report growing solidarity among the prisoners, and the holding area is becoming increasingly\
  \ volatile.

event.SILENCE.message={0}, there''s been an eerie and unusual silence coming from the prisoners''\
  \ holding area. This is out of character, especially given recent behavior. It could indicate\

  \ you''d like to proceed.
response.0.SILENCE.button=Check on them
response.0.SILENCE.tooltip=Ensure everything is in order.
response.0.SILENCE.success={0}, a quick inspection revealed no immediate issues. The prisoners\

response.1.SILENCE.tooltip=Silence is better than trouble.
response.1.SILENCE.success={0}, leaving the prisoners undisturbed seems to have been the right call.\
  \ The silence persisted for a while before normal activity resumed. Guards report no unusual\

response.1.SILENCE.failure={0}, choosing not to act allowed the prisoners to coordinate. A sudden\

response.2.SILENCE.button=Set up surveillance
response.2.SILENCE.tooltip=Keep an eye on the situation from a distance.

response.0.SINGING.button=Encourage it
response.0.SINGING.tooltip=Cooperation might keep things calm
response.0.SINGING.success={0}, allowing the singing to continue seems to have had a calming effect\

  \ peaceful.
response.0.SINGING.failure={0}, encouraging the singing backfired. The prisoners have used the\

  \ effort to defy authority. The holding area feels more volatile despite the temporary calm.
response.1.SINGING.button=Disperse them
response.1.SINGING.tooltip=Unity among prisoners is dangerous
response.1.SINGING.success={0}, dispersing the prisoners before their unity could solidify seems to\
  \ have been the right call. While there was some grumbling, the groups have returned to their\
  \ usual divisions, and guards report no further signs of collaboration. The holding area remains\
  \ secure.
response.1.SINGING.failure={0}, breaking up the singing caused significant unrest. The prisoners\

response.2.SINGING.button=Record it
response.2.SINGING.tooltip=It could be useful propaganda
response.2.SINGING.success={0}, recording the prisoners'' singing provided valuable insights.\
  \ Analysis of the lyrics revealed no hidden messages or coordination, but the recording could be\

response.2.SINGING.failure={0}, recording the singing caused unease among the prisoners, who\
  \ noticed the increased surveillance and interpreted it as an attempt to exploit their actions.\

event.PAPER.message={0}, during a routine cell inspection, we discovered a scrap of paper covered\

response.0.PAPER.button=Decipher it
response.0.PAPER.tooltip=Assign someone to figure out its meaning.
response.0.PAPER.success={0}, deciphering the symbols revealed a rudimentary code being used to\

response.2.PAPER.button=Let it be
response.2.PAPER.tooltip=It''s probably meaningless.
response.2.PAPER.success={0}, choosing not to act seems to have been the right decision. The symbols\
  \ turned out to be nothing more than art, and the prisoners have moved on to other distractions.\
  \ The holding area remains stable, and no signs of unrest have emerged.
response.2.PAPER.failure={0}, ignoring the paper was a mistake. Guards later discovered that the\
  \ symbols were part of a larger coordination effort, and by the time it was uncovered, some\

  \ measures are being taken.

event.HOLIDAY.message={0}, the prisoners appear to be celebrating a holiday, using improvised\
  \ decorations made from scraps around the holding area. So far, it seems harmless, but it''s\

response.1.HOLIDAY.button=Allow it
response.1.HOLIDAY.tooltip=A little morale boost won''t hurt.
response.1.HOLIDAY.success={0}, allowing the celebrations to continue had a surprisingly positive\

response.2.HOLIDAY.button=Exploit it
response.2.HOLIDAY.tooltip=Use the celebration to extract information.
response.2.HOLIDAY.success={0}, using the celebrations to gather intel proved effective. Guards\
  \ were able to mingle and discreetly extract information about the prisoners'' plans and\

  \ are now attempting to rally support from their peers, making the situation more volatile.
response.1.WHISPERS.button=Eavesdrop
response.1.WHISPERS.tooltip=Try to learn what they''re planning.
response.1.WHISPERS.success={0}, eavesdropping on the prisoners revealed discussions of an escape\
  \ plan. Guards intervened before the plan could be set in motion, and the prisoners involved have\
  \ been isolated. The holding area remains secure, and morale among the staff has improved with\
  \ this proactive action.
response.1.WHISPERS.failure={0}, the attempt to eavesdrop was detected, and the prisoners\
  \ immediately stopped talking. Their suspicion has spread to the rest of the population,\

  \ result.
response.2.WHISPERS.button=Let it go
response.2.WHISPERS.tooltip=Alliances sometimes form under strange circumstances.
response.2.WHISPERS.success={0}, ignoring the whispers turned out to be the right choice. The\

  \ Guards report no signs of coordinated activity, and the holding area remains calm.
response.2.WHISPERS.failure={0}, letting the situation go unchecked backfired. The two prisoners\
  \ were coordinating an effort to disrupt operations, and their plans are now in motion. Guards\
  \ are scrambling to contain the situation, and the holding area is growing increasingly unstable.

event.LEADER.message={0}, one of the prisoners appears to have significant influence over the others,\
  \ despite speaking very little. Their presence alone seems to command respect or compliance,\

  \ this individual might warrant closer monitoring or isolation if their influence becomes\
  \ disruptive. Let us know your orders.
response.0.LEADER.button=Interrogate them
response.0.LEADER.tooltip=Find out what makes them so respected.
response.0.LEADER.success={0}, the interrogation revealed that the prisoner''s influence stems from\

  \ about the prisoner''s background and potential plans, and their influence has diminished after\
  \ being publicly questioned. The holding area remains calm.
response.0.LEADER.failure={0}, the interrogation backfired. The prisoner refused to cooperate, and\

response.1.LEADER.button=Isolate them
response.1.LEADER.tooltip=Remove them to weaken their influence.
response.1.LEADER.success={0}, isolating the influential prisoner successfully disrupted their sway\
  \ over the others. Without their presence, the prisoners seem disorganized and less defiant.\
  \ Guards report a noticeable decrease in tension, and the holding area remains secure.
response.1.LEADER.failure={0}, isolating the prisoner caused significant unrest. The other\
  \ prisoners now view them as a martyr, and their influence has grown even in isolation. Guards\

response.2.LEADER.button=Observe quietly
response.2.LEADER.tooltip=See how the dynamic develops.
response.2.LEADER.success={0}, quiet observation revealed no immediate signs of disruption. The\
  \ prisoner''s influence seems passive rather than active, and guards have been able to\
  \ maintain order without interference. The holding area remains stable, and the situation is\
  \ under control.
response.2.LEADER.failure={0}, observing quietly allowed the prisoner to consolidate their\

response.0.ARGUMENTS.failure={0}, the mediation attempt failed. Neither guard was willing to back\

response.1.ARGUMENTS.button=Reassign one of them
response.1.ARGUMENTS.tooltip=End the feud by separating them.
response.1.ARGUMENTS.success={0}, reassigning one of the guards effectively ended the feud. Both\

response.2.ARGUMENTS.button=Let them sort it out
response.2.ARGUMENTS.tooltip=It''s not your job to babysit.
response.2.ARGUMENTS.success={0}, allowing the guards to resolve their dispute on their own proved\
  \ effective. They reached an understanding after a heated discussion, and the team is back on\
  \ track. Morale has stabilized, and operations in the holding area continue without issue.
response.2.ARGUMENTS.failure={0}, leaving the guards to sort it out only worsened the situation.\

response.1.SENTIMENTAL_ITEM.button=Deny the request
response.1.SENTIMENTAL_ITEM.tooltip=Personal items could be used for manipulation.
response.1.SENTIMENTAL_ITEM.success={0}, denying the request sent a clear message that security\

  \ remains stable.
response.1.GHOSTS.failure={0}, ignoring the situation caused it to escalate. The prisoner''s\
  \ condition worsened, and their presence has become a rallying point for fear and superstition\
  \ among the population. Guards are reporting heightened tension and erratic behavior in the\
  \ holding area.
response.2.GHOSTS.button=Separate them
response.2.GHOSTS.tooltip=Move the prisoner into isolation to prevent their despair from spreading\
  \ to others.
response.2.GHOSTS.success={0}, moving the prisoner to isolation has calmed the holding area\
  \ significantly. Without the unsettling influence, the other prisoners appear more focused and\
  \ less fearful. Guards report that tensions are low, and the holding area is secure.
response.2.GHOSTS.failure={0}, isolating the prisoner created backlash among the others, who now see\
  \ them as a tragic figure. The incident has fueled resentment and whispers of defiance, leading\
  \ to increased hostility in the holding area. Guards are on high alert.

event.VOICES.message={0}, guards reported hearing muffled voices coming from a cell that is\
  \ supposed to be unoccupied. Upon investigation, we found messages scratched into the walls,\
  \ apparently left by prisoners who were previously held there. One message reads: "We are\
  \ forgotten, and so are you." The discovery has deeply unsettled my men, and it may rile the\
  \ prisoners if word spreads. Recommend sealing the cell and determining whether any further\
  \ action is necessary to maintain morale and order. Let us know how you''d like us to proceed.
response.0.VOICES.button=Erase the messages
response.0.VOICES.tooltip=Have the guards scrub the walls clean to avoid unnerving the current\
  \ prisoners.
response.0.VOICES.success={0}, the messages were scrubbed clean, and the cell was sealed without\
  \ incident. Guards and prisoners alike seem less unnerved now that the evidence is gone. The\
  \ holding area remains calm, and morale among the guards has improved.
response.0.VOICES.failure={0}, scrubbing the messages created suspicion among the prisoners, who\
  \ have started spreading rumors about what was erased. Guards report increased tension, and the\
  \ atmosphere in the holding area feels more volatile.
response.1.VOICES.button=Let the prisoners see them
response.1.VOICES.tooltip=Use the messages to show what happens to those who defy you.
response.1.VOICES.success={0}, showing the messages to the prisoners had the intended effect. Many\
  \ of them are visibly shaken, and their defiance has given way to quiet submission. Guards\
  \ report that the holding area is now far more subdued and easier to manage.
response.1.VOICES.failure={0}, letting the prisoners see the messages backfired. They interpret\
  \ them as a warning from past captives and are now more united in their defiance. Guards report a\
  \ surge in tension and increased coordination among the prisoners.
response.2.VOICES.button=Investigate the voices
response.2.VOICES.tooltip=Assign guards to monitor the cell - are the voices hallucinations, or\
  \ something more sinister?
response.2.VOICES.success={0}, monitoring the cell revealed no evidence of supernatural activity,\
  \ but guards discovered subtle environmental factors - like air currents - that could explain the\
  \ sounds. This investigation has reassured the staff, and the holding area is now more secure and\
  \ calm.
response.2.VOICES.failure={0}, the investigation into the voices only deepened the mystery. Guards\
  \ report an eerie atmosphere and are visibly unsettled. Word of the unexplained phenomenon is\
  \ spreading among the prisoners, and tensions are rising in the holding area.

# MAJOR
event.BREAKOUT.message={0}, we have a mass breakout in progress! Prisoners are flooding through a\
  \ breach in the holding cell wall - they used stolen equipment and improvised explosives to blow\
  \ it open! Some of them are armed and engaging the guards, trying to fight their way out. We need\
  \ immediate reinforcements to contain this, or they''re going to overwhelm us! Awaiting your\
  \ orders!
response.0.BREAKOUT.button=Lock down the perimeter
response.0.BREAKOUT.tooltip=Focus on preventing any prisoners from leaving the base, even if it\
  \ costs lives.
response.0.BREAKOUT.success={0}, the perimeter lockdown was successful. No prisoners managed to\
  \ escape, though the operation was intense, with some guards sustaining injuries. The breach\
  \ has been secured, and the facility is back under control. The prisoners have been subdued, and\
  \ order has been restored.
response.0.BREAKOUT.failure={0}, despite our efforts to lock down the perimeter, many prisoners\
  \ managed to slip through in the chaos. The guards sustained heavy casualties holding the line,\
  \ and the breach caused significant damage. While the immediate threat has been contained, the\
  \ escapees are unaccounted for, and morale among the team is low.
response.1.BREAKOUT.button=Pursue escapees aggressively
response.1.BREAKOUT.tooltip=Send guards and combat units after fleeing prisoners at full force,\
  \ risking significant casualties.
response.1.BREAKOUT.success={0}, the aggressive pursuit paid off. The majority of the escapees have\
  \ been recaptured, and the rest were neutralized. The operation was costly, with several guards\
  \ injured, but the breakout has been thwarted. Order is restored, and the remaining prisoners are\
  \ under control.
response.1.BREAKOUT.failure={0}, the aggressive pursuit failed. The escapees scattered in multiple\
  \ directions, overwhelming our forces. Several guards were lost or injured in the pursuit, and a\
  \ significant number of prisoners is still at large. The breach has been secured, but the\
  \ breakout''s impact will take time to recover from.
response.2.BREAKOUT.button=Cut your losses
response.2.BREAKOUT.tooltip=Focus on containing the remaining prisoners while letting some escape.
response.2.BREAKOUT.success={0}, cutting our losses allowed us to focus on securing the remaining\
  \ prisoners and minimizing casualties. While some prisoners escaped, the breach has been\
  \ repaired, and the facility is stable. The guards are regrouping, and the remaining population\
  \ has been subdued.
response.2.BREAKOUT.failure={0}, cutting our losses only emboldened the prisoners. While we secured\
  \ the remaining population, the number of escapees was higher than expected. The facility is\
  \ intact, but morale among the guards has plummeted, and tensions are high among the remaining\
  \ prisoners. Stability is fragile at best.

event.RIOT.message={0}, the prisoners have erupted into a full-scale riot! They''ve armed\
  \ themselves with makeshift weapons - pipes, sharp tools, even shards of metal ripped from the\
  \ holding area. We''ve fallen back to the control room. The barricades won''t hold for long, and\
  \ they''re trying to force their way in! We need backup and orders immediately, or we''re going\
  \ to lose control of the entire facility!
response.0.RIOT.button=Deploy riot suppression teams
response.0.RIOT.tooltip=Use stun weapons and tear gas to bring the prisoners under control.
response.0.RIOT.success={0}, the riot suppression teams successfully subdued the prisoners. Stun\
  \ weapons and tear gas brought the situation under control, and all hostiles have been\
  \ restrained. There were injuries on both sides, but no major casualties. The facility is\
  \ secure, and order has been fully restored.
response.0.RIOT.failure={0}, the riot suppression teams were overwhelmed. The prisoners resisted\
  \ tear gas and makeshift barricades, overrunning critical areas before retreating guards could\
  \ regroup. Many guards sustained injuries, and the holding area has suffered significant\
  \ damage. The riot has been quelled, but the aftermath will require a full assessment.
response.1.RIOT.button=Call in reinforcements
response.1.RIOT.tooltip=Deploy combat units to decisively end the riot, even if it means\
  \ significant bloodshed.
response.1.RIOT.success={0}, reinforcements successfully ended the riot. The combat units acted\
  \ decisively, overpowering the prisoners and restoring full control of the facility. There were\
  \ some injuries among the prisoners, including several casualties, but the situation is resolved,\
  \ and the facility is secure once more.
response.1.RIOT.failure={0}, reinforcements engaged the prisoners, but the riot escalated further\
  \ before it could be stopped. Heavy fighting caused significant damage to the facility, and\
  \ multiple injuries were reported on both sides. While control has been regained, the cost was\
  \ high, and parts of the compound are heavily compromised.
response.2.RIOT.button=Offer terms of surrender
response.2.RIOT.tooltip=Promise improved conditions to quell the violence, knowing it might\
  \ embolden the prisoners later.
response.2.RIOT.success={0}, the prisoners accepted the terms of surrender, and the riot has been\
  \ defused. They disarmed and returned to their cells after receiving assurances of improved\
  \ conditions. While the situation is under control, tensions in the facility remain high, and the\
  \ guards are on edge following the incident.
response.2.RIOT.failure={0}, the prisoners rejected the terms of surrender and escalated their\
  \ assault before the riot was finally subdued. They seized additional sections of the facility\
  \ and inflicted serious damage before eventually being overpowered. While the immediate threat\
  \ has passed, the holding area is left in disarray.

event.MURDER.message={0}, we''ve found a prisoner dead in their cell - murdered! The other\
  \ prisoners are furious, and they''re blaming us for letting this happen. They''re threatening\
  \ revenge unless the killer is identified immediately! Tensions are about to explode - we need\
  \ instructions on how to defuse this before it turns into a bloodbath!
response.0.MURDER.button=Launch a full investigation
response.0.MURDER.tooltip=Dedicate resources to finding the murderer and addressing prisoner\
  \ grievances.
response.0.MURDER.success={0}, the investigation was a success. The murderer was identified and\
  \ taken into custody, and the other prisoners are satisfied that justice has been served. While\
  \ tensions remain, the swift and thorough response has calmed the situation. The facility is\
  \ stable, and order has been restored.
response.0.MURDER.failure={0}, the investigation failed to uncover the murderer. Despite our\
  \ efforts, the lack of results has only fueled prisoner anger, and their distrust in us has\
  \ deepened. While the immediate violence has subsided, tensions remain dangerously high, and the\
  \ prisoners are still on edge.
response.1.MURDER.button=Blame a scapegoat
response.1.MURDER.tooltip=Pin the murder on a convenient suspect to restore order quickly, even if\
  \ they''re innocent.
response.1.MURDER.success={0}, a convenient suspect was blamed for the murder, and the prisoners\
  \ accepted the explanation. The scapegoat was removed from the population, and tensions have\
  \ eased significantly. While the situation is now under control, some guards have voiced concerns\
  \ about the ethics of this decision.
response.1.MURDER.failure={0}, the attempt to blame a scapegoat backfired. The prisoners saw\
  \ through the ruse and are more furious than ever. They believe we''re hiding the real murderer,\
  \ and their demands for justice have escalated. Order has been restored for now, but the unrest\
  \ is far from over.
response.2.MURDER.button=Punish the rest
response.2.MURDER.tooltip=Crack down hard on the other prisoners, regardless of whether they were\
  \ involved.
response.2.MURDER.success={0}, a harsh crackdown on the prisoners has restored order. While many\
  \ of them are bitter about the collective punishment, the display of authority has subdued any\
  \ immediate threats. The facility is secure, though tensions remain beneath the surface.
response.2.MURDER.failure={0}, the crackdown sparked even more chaos. The prisoners resisted\
  \ fiercely, resulting in widespread injuries and significant damage to the facility. While the\
  \ riot has been quelled, the cost was high, and the population is now even more defiant. Order\
  \ has been restored, but the situation remains volatile.

event.FIRE.message={0}, a fire has broken out in one of the prisoner cellblocks! We''re scrambling\
  \ to respond, but we''re struggling to contain the blaze. Prisoners are screaming for help as the\
  \ flames spread - some are trying to break free in the chaos, while others are turning on each\
  \ other to survive. The cause of the fire is still unclear - could be an accident or sabotage. We\
  \ need immediate orders on how to prioritize containment, rescues, and security!
response.0.FIRE.button=Save as many as possible
response.0.FIRE.tooltip=Focus your efforts on rescuing prisoners and guards, even if it means\
  \ losing critical resources or risking a breakout.
response.0.FIRE.success={0}, we prioritized rescues, and many prisoners and guards were saved from\
  \ the blaze. Though we lost some critical resources and sustained damage to the facility, the\
  \ majority of lives were spared. The fire has been extinguished, and order is being\
  \ reestablished. While the situation was costly, the effort has restored some trust among the\
  \ prisoners.
response.0.FIRE.failure={0}, despite our best efforts to rescue as many as possible, the fire\
  \ spread too quickly. Several prisoners and guards couldn''t be saved, and critical resources\
  \ were destroyed in the chaos. While the blaze is now extinguished, the loss of life and damage\
  \ to the facility have left morale in shambles.
response.1.FIRE.button=Secure the perimeter
response.1.FIRE.tooltip=Lock down the camp to prevent any escape attempts, even if it means\
  \ sacrificing lives in the cellblock.
response.1.FIRE.success={0}, the perimeter has been secured, and no prisoners managed to escape\
  \ during the chaos. While several prisoners perished in the fire, the facility remains intact,\
  \ and critical infrastructure has been preserved. Order has been restored, but the loss of life\
  \ has heightened tensions within the population.
response.1.FIRE.failure={0}, we locked down the perimeter, but the decision came at a heavy cost.\
  \ Many prisoners and even some guards succumbed to the fire while we focused on security, and\
  \ critical parts of the facility were severely damaged. While no one escaped, the backlash among\
  \ the surviving prisoners is intense, and trust in our leadership has eroded.
response.2.FIRE.button=Investigate first
response.2.FIRE.tooltip=Prioritize finding the source of the fire - sabotage could indicate a\
  \ larger conspiracy among the prisoners.
response.2.FIRE.success={0}, we prioritized investigating the fire and uncovered evidence of\
  \ deliberate sabotage by a faction of prisoners. While the delay in response meant more lives and\
  \ resources were lost, the discovery of this plot has allowed us to identify key culprits and\
  \ prevent future incidents. The fire is extinguished, and the perpetrators have been detained.
response.2.FIRE.failure={0}, the investigation delayed our response to the fire, resulting in\
  \ significant loss of life and damage to the facility. To make matters worse, we found no\
  \ conclusive evidence of sabotage, and the cause of the fire remains uncertain. The surviving\
  \ prisoners are furious, and the facility is in disarray. This failure has only added fuel to the\
  \ unrest.

event.POISON.message={0}, several personnel have fallen ill - turns out their rations were\
  \ poisoned! Investigation reveals a prisoner managed to sabotage the supply lines, and we have\
  \ reason to believe there''s more poison hidden somewhere. The affected personnel aren''t in a\
  \ critical condition, but panic is spreading. We need immediate instructions to secure the\
  \ supplies and contain this threat before it gets worse!
response.0.POISON.button=Shut down food distribution
response.0.POISON.tooltip=Halt all meals temporarily and investigate thoroughly.
response.0.POISON.success={0}, food distribution was immediately halted, and a thorough\
  \ investigation uncovered additional poisoned food supplies. The prisoners were angered by the\
  \ disruption, but no further cases of poisoning occurred, and panic has subsided. Security\
  \ protocols have been reinforced, and the situation is now under control.
response.0.POISON.failure={0}, shutting down food distribution caused widespread disruption,\
  \ sparking unrest and even minor skirmishes in the holding area. Despite this, we failed to\
  \ locate additional poison in the supply. Tensions remain high.
response.1.POISON.button=Punish the suspected saboteur
response.1.POISON.tooltip=Identify and punish a likely suspect to deter further attempts.
response.1.POISON.success={0}, the suspected saboteur was identified and punished. The decisive\
  \ action has sent a clear message to the prisoners, deterring further attempts to sabotage our\
  \ rations. The situation has calmed, and food distribution has resumed under tighter security\
  \ measures. Panic has been contained, and the affected personnel are recovering.
response.1.POISON.failure={0}, punishing the suspected saboteur backfired - our evidence was\
  \ inconclusive, and the prisoners are now accusing us of scapegoating. Distrust has spread, and\
  \ some personnel are refusing their rations entirely. The base remains on edge, and tensions are\
  \ rising.
response.2.POISON.button=Increase food inspections
response.2.POISON.tooltip=Focus on longer-term security measures while addressing the immediate crisis.
response.2.POISON.success={0}, food inspections were ramped up immediately, and we identified and\
  \ removed several poisoned rations from circulation. While the process delayed food distribution,\
  \ it reassured the prisoners and guards alike. The affected personnel are recovering, and the\
  \ enhanced security measures have stabilized the situation.
response.2.POISON.failure={0}, increased food inspections failed to uncover any additional poison,\
  \ and the delays in distribution only added to the tension. Some personnel are accusing us of\
  \ negligence. The threat of further sabotage remains unresolved, and morale is low across the\
  \ base.

event.HOSTAGE.message={0}, we have an emergency! During a routine inspection, a group of prisoners\
  \ overpowered my guards and has taken one of them hostage! They''re demanding better conditions\
  \ and immediate release, threatening to kill the hostage if their demands aren''t met. The\
  \ situation is extremely volatile, and we don''t know how long we have to negotiate. We need your\
  \ orders immediately!
response.0.HOSTAGE.button=Negotiate for time
response.0.HOSTAGE.tooltip=Stall the prisoners with minor concessions while preparing a rescue\
  \ operation.
response.0.HOSTAGE.success={0}, the negotiations bought us enough time to organize a successful\
  \ rescue operation. The hostage was freed with only minor injuries, and the prisoners involved\
  \ have been subdued and detained. While the situation was tense, the outcome was a success, and\
  \ order has been restored.
response.0.HOSTAGE.failure={0}, the negotiations stalled, and the prisoners used the delay to\
  \ reinforce their position. By the time we attempted the rescue, they executed the hostage and\
  \ inflicted heavy casualties on the assault team. The situation has been resolved, but at a\
  \ devastating cost.
response.1.HOSTAGE.button=Storm the area
response.1.HOSTAGE.tooltip=Launch a risky assault to save the hostage, regardless of casualties.
response.1.HOSTAGE.success={0}, the assault team acted swiftly, overwhelming the prisoners and\
  \ rescuing the hostage. While there were injuries during the operation, the hostage was recovered\
  \ alive, and the prisoners responsible have been secured. The operation was a success, and the\
  \ facility is under control once again.
response.1.HOSTAGE.failure={0}, the assault to rescue the hostage failed. The prisoners killed the\
  \ hostage during the attack, and several guards were injured or killed in the chaos. Although the\
  \ prisoners were eventually subdued, the cost was high, and morale among the security team has\
  \ plummeted. The facility is secure, but the scars from this event will linger.
response.2.HOSTAGE.button=Refuse their demands outright
response.2.HOSTAGE.tooltip=Take a hardline stance, knowing the hostage''s life may be lost.
response.2.HOSTAGE.success={0}, taking a hardline stance paid off. The prisoners hesitated and\
  \ ultimately released the hostage unharmed, fearing retaliation. The guards quickly subdued the\
  \ ringleaders, and the situation has been resolved without bloodshed. While tensions remain high,\
  \ the facility is stable, and our authority has been reinforced.
response.2.HOSTAGE.failure={0}, refusing their demands led to the worst outcome. The prisoners\
  \ executed the hostage and escalated their defiance, forcing guards to intervene with deadly\
  \ force. The situation was ultimately contained, but the loss of life and the display of\
  \ violence have left the facility in a state of shock.

event.BOMB.message={0}, a prisoner-planted explosive just detonated in a critical part of the\
  \ facility - the power generator has been hit! Systems are failing, and the blast has\
  \ thrown everything into chaos. The prisoners are using the confusion to launch a coordinated\
  \ attack and attempt a breakout! We''re under heavy assault and barely holding the line. We need\
  \ reinforcements and immediate orders before the situation spirals completely out of control!
response.0.BOMB.button=Secure critical areas
response.0.BOMB.tooltip=Focus on protecting vital systems to prevent further damage, even if\
  \ prisoners escape.
response.0.BOMB.success={0}, critical areas of the facility have been secured. While a few\
  \ prisoners managed to escape during the chaos, the guards successfully protected vital systems,\
  \ preventing further damage. The power generator is offline but intact enough to be repaired. The\
  \ situation is now under control, and the facility''s stability has been preserved.
response.0.BOMB.failure={0}, we focused on securing critical systems, but the effort came at a cost.\
  \ A large group of prisoners managed to escape in the confusion, and damage to the generator is\
  \ extensive. While the immediate threat has been contained, the facility is in disarray, and the\
  \ escapees are unaccounted for.
response.1.BOMB.button=Pursue the saboteurs
response.1.BOMB.tooltip=Send guards after the responsible prisoners, prioritizing retribution over\
  \ security.
response.1.BOMB.success={0}, the guards tracked down and captured the saboteurs behind the\
  \ explosion. Their capture has prevented further coordinated attacks, though the effort left\
  \ other parts of the facility vulnerable. The damage to the generator is extensive, but with the\
  \ ringleaders in custody, the prisoners'' momentum has been crushed, and order is being restored.
response.1.BOMB.failure={0}, pursuing the saboteurs backfired. While the guards managed to apprehend\
  \ some of them, the delay in securing vital systems allowed the breakout to spiral out of\
  \ control. Many prisoners escaped, and the generator sustained catastrophic damage. The situation\
  \ is under control for now, but the losses are severe.
response.2.BOMB.button=Call for reinforcements
response.2.BOMB.tooltip=Bring in additional manpower to handle the chaos, though it may leave other\
  \ areas vulnerable.
response.2.BOMB.success={0}, reinforcements arrived just in time to help contain the breakout and\
  \ stabilize the facility. The coordinated attack was repelled, and the majority of the prisoners\
  \ involved have been subdued or recaptured. The generator is damaged, but the facility is secure,\
  \ and order has been restored.
response.2.BOMB.failure={0}, reinforcements arrived too late to prevent widespread chaos. By the\
  \ time they intervened, significant damage had been done to the generator, and many prisoners had\
  \ already escaped. While the facility has been stabilized, the aftermath of the breakout will\
  \ take considerable time and resources to address.

event.EXECUTION.message={0}, we''ve got a crisis - prisoners just carried out a public execution in\
  \ the holding area, claiming the victim was a collaborator. By the time we arrived, it was too\
  \ late to stop it. Now the prisoners are openly defiant, treating this as a show of strength.\
  \ Tensions are boiling over, and the situation could escalate into full-scale violence at any\
  \ moment. We need orders immediately - how do we contain this?
response.0.EXECUTION.button=Punish the mob leaders
response.0.EXECUTION.tooltip=Identify and publicly punish those responsible to reassert control.
response.0.EXECUTION.success={0}, the mob leaders were identified and swiftly punished, sending a\
  \ clear message to the rest of the prisoners. While tensions remain high, the show of authority\
  \ has reasserted control over the population. The situation has been stabilized, and no further\
  \ violence has occurred.
response.0.EXECUTION.failure={0}, our attempt to punish the mob leaders backfired. The prisoners\
  \ retaliated violently, escalating the situation into a full-blown riot. Several guards were\
  \ injured, and parts of the facility sustained damage before order was finally restored. The\
  \ aftermath has left the facility on edge and resources stretched thin.
response.1.EXECUTION.button=Divide and isolate factions
response.1.EXECUTION.tooltip=Separate prisoners based on alliances to reduce tensions, even if it\
  \ spreads your resources thin.
response.1.EXECUTION.success={0}, faction leaders were identified, and the prisoners were divided\
  \ and isolated based on their alliances. The separation has reduced tensions significantly,\
  \ preventing further outbreaks of violence. While the approach has stretched our resources,\
  \ the facility is now stable, and control has been reestablished.
response.1.EXECUTION.failure={0}, dividing the prisoners only created new flash points, as tensions\
  \ flared within the isolated groups. The strain on our resources made it difficult to maintain\
  \ order, and skirmishes broke out across multiple sections of the facility. The situation has\
  \ been contained, but the fractures among the population remain volatile.
response.2.EXECUTION.button=Use this as a warning
response.2.EXECUTION.tooltip=Let the execution stand as a grim reminder of what happens if the\
  \ guards weren't around.
response.2.EXECUTION.success={0}, we let the execution stand as a warning to the population, and\
  \ the grim  message seems to have worked. The prisoners are subdued, recognizing the consequences\
  \ of defiance. While this approach has left lingering unease, the facility is secure, and no\
  \ further incidents have occurred.
response.2.EXECUTION.failure={0}, treating the execution as a warning backfired. Instead of\
  \ deterring unrest, it emboldened the prisoners, who now view it as a victory. Defiance is\
  \ spreading, and tensions in the facility are at an all-time high. While the situation hasn''t\
  \ escalated into open violence yet, it''s dangerously close.

event.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.message={0}, we''ve just uncovered a horrifying situation - a neglected wing\
  \ of the compound was rediscovered after prisoners were mistakenly transferred there during a\
  \ chaotic intake process. Guards found emaciated bodies, skeletal prisoners barely clinging to\
  \ life, and others who didn''t survive. The survivors are pleading for rescue and accusing us of\
  \ abandoning them. This could spiral into chaos if word spreads further. We need immediate orders\
  \ on how to handle this before it turns into a full-blown crisis.
response.0.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.button=Provide immediate aid
response.0.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.tooltip=Dedicate resources to saving the survivors, even if it strains\
  \ your supplies.
response.0.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.success={0}, immediate aid was provided to the survivors, stabilizing\
  \ their condition. While this strained our supplies and personnel, the effort has quelled\
  \ accusations and restored a measure of trust among the prisoners. The situation has been\
  \ contained, and morale is recovering, though resources remain tight.
response.0.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.failure={0}, despite our efforts to provide aid, it was too late for\
  \ many of the prisoners. The survivors are resentful and spreading accusations of negligence,\
  \ fueling unrest in the facility. The strain on our supplies has left us vulnerable, and tensions\
  \ are rising among both prisoners and staff.
response.1.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.button=Hide the evidence
response.1.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.tooltip=Quietly cover up the incident to prevent morale loss or\
  \ political fallout.
response.1.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.success={0}, the incident was quietly covered up. The bodies were\
  \ removed, and the surviving prisoners were integrated back into the general population under\
  \ close observation. No information has leaked, and the situation has been contained without\
  \ further fallout. The facility remains stable.
response.1.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.failure={0}, the attempt to cover up the incident failed. Word spread\
  \ among the prisoners before we could act, and now the population is furious, accusing us of\
  \ hiding atrocities. The backlash has destabilized the facility, and maintaining control will be\
  \ challenging in the days ahead.
response.2.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.button=Blame the prisoners
response.2.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.tooltip=Shift responsibility for the disaster onto the prisoners\
  \ themselves to maintain control over the remaining population.
response.2.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.success={0}, shifting responsibility to the prisoners has diffused\
  \ blame from our crew. By framing the incident as a result of infighting and poor organization\
  \ among the prisoners, we''ve avoided further accusations. While tensions remain, the population\
  \ is subdued, and the facility is stable for now.
response.2.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.failure={0}, blaming the prisoners only inflamed the situation. The\
  \ survivors and their allies have become openly defiant, accusing us of cruelty and negligence.\
  \ The unrest is spreading, and the situation is dangerously close to spiraling out of control.\
  \ The facility is on edge, and stability is tenuous.

event.UNITED.message={0}, we''ve got a major crisis - prisoners from rival groups have set aside\
  \ their differences and formed a united front against us! Their cooperation has allowed them to\
  \ overwhelm my guards and seize control of an entire holding wing. They''re fortifying their\
  \ position and could spread further if we don''t act fast. We need clear orders on how to retake\
  \ the area before this escalates even more!
response.0.UNITED.button=Divide and conquer
response.0.UNITED.tooltip=Exploit old rivalries to shatter the alliance from within.
response.0.UNITED.success={0}, we exploited old rivalries among the prisoners, planting rumors and\
  \ sowing distrust within their alliance. The united front shattered as factions turned on each\
  \ other, allowing guards to retake the holding wing with minimal resistance. The facility is\
  \ secure, and tensions among the prisoners are back to manageable levels.
response.0.UNITED.failure={0}, our attempts to divide the alliance failed. The prisoners saw\
  \ through the ploy and grew even more unified against us. They''ve tightened their defenses, and\
  \ regaining the holding wing required significant force.
response.1.UNITED.button=Launch a full assault
response.1.UNITED.tooltip=Retake the area with overwhelming force, even if it costs lives.
response.1.UNITED.success={0}, the full assault succeeded. Guards overwhelmed the prisoners with\
  \ decisive force, retaking the holding wing. While there were casualties on both sides, the\
  \ operation reestablished control over the area, and the remaining prisoners have been subdued.\
  \ The facility is stable once again.
response.1.UNITED.failure={0}, the full assault failed. The prisoners were heavily fortified, and\
  \ the guards suffered significant casualties during the operation. Despite this, they were\
  \ successful, and the holding wing is back under our control.
response.2.UNITED.button=Cut them off
response.2.UNITED.tooltip=Seal the wing and starve the prisoners of resources, forcing them to\
  \ surrender over time.

response.2.UNITED.failure={0}, cutting off the holding wing backfired. The prisoners found ways to\
  \ fortify their position and scavenged resources to sustain themselves. Meanwhile, unrest spread\
  \ among the rest of the population, who viewed this as proof of our cruelty. The situation was\
  \ deteriorating rapidly, and the facility''s stability at risk, so I authorized a full assault.\
  \ The assault was successful, but not without casualties.
