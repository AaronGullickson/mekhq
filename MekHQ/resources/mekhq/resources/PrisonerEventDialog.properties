free.report=%s has been freed.
freeEvent0.message=%s, as ordered, we've released prisoners from the overcrowded sections. They\
  \ were processed swiftly, provided minimal supplies for their journey, and escorted beyond the\
  \ perimeter. The remaining prisoners seem calmer, though some voiced frustration about not being\
  \ included in the release.
freeEvent1.message=%s, we've freed a group of prisoners deemed least likely to pose a threat. They\
  \ were escorted to the gates and sent on their way with basic provisions. The holding areas are\
  \ less crowded now, and the guards are reporting fewer signs of unrest among the remaining\
  \ population.
freeEvent2.message=%s, the release operation is complete. Twenty-five prisoners were carefully\
  \ selected and processed out of the facility. We ensured they left with no contraband, and the\
  \ transition went smoothly. Morale among the guards has improved, though the population remains\
  \ wary.
freeEvent3.message=%s, a number of prisoners were freed from the holding wing. They were escorted\
  \ to the outer perimeter, and the gates were sealed behind them. The atmosphere in the facility\
  \ has stabilized somewhat, with guards reporting a noticeable reduction in tension.
freeEvent4.message=%s, we successfully freed 18 prisoners, prioritizing those with no history of\
  \ violence. They were released at a secure checkpoint and directed away from the facility. The\
  \ remaining prisoners are subdued, and overcrowding has been significantly reduced.

  \ with no incidents during the transfer. The guards are reporting improved conditions in the\
  \ holding areas, and order is being reestablished.
freeEvent6.message=%s, as directed, we've released a group of low-risk prisoners. They were\
  \ processed and sent out under supervision. The mood among the guards is improving now that we've\
  \ eased the burden, though some prisoners still seem restless.
freeEvent7.message=%s, prisoners were freed from the compound earlier today. The release was\
  \ orderly, and the guards ensured that none of the remaining population attempted to interfere.\
  \ Overcrowding is no longer an issue, and operations have stabilized.

  \ was completed without incident, and the holding cells are now operating within capacity. The\
  \ guards are resuming normal duties, and the remaining prisoners appear less agitated.

  \ processed and released with basic rations. The remaining prisoners are calmer now that the\
  \ overcrowding has been addressed. The guards have returned to their posts, and the situation is\
  \ stable.
freeEvent10.message=%s, per your directive, we've released some prisoners. Each individual was\
  \ processed thoroughly, ensuring no contraband or intelligence was removed from the facility.\
  \ They were escorted beyond the perimeter under close supervision. The operation proceeded\
  \ without incident, and the remaining prisoners are subdued for now.
freeEvent11.message=%s, the release of prisoners has been completed. The process went smoother than\
  \ expected, with no resistance from the remaining population. Overcrowding in the cells is no\
  \ longer an issue, and the guards are reporting a much-needed reprieve.
freeEvent12.message=%s, the prisoner release has been carried out. While the operation was\
  \ successful, some of our men expressed frustration at seeing hardened combatants set free.\
  \ Nonetheless, the cells are now at manageable levels, and we remain vigilant for any\
  \ repercussions.
freeEvent13.message=%s, as ordered, some prisoners were released earlier today. The process was\
  \ conducted methodically, ensuring no disruptions. While this decision has relieved pressure on\
  \ the facility, it's a calculated risk that we'll monitor closely.
freeEvent14.message=%s, prisoners have been processed and released from custody. The operation was\
  \ completed without complications, and the overcrowding in the holding area has been alleviated.\
  \ Guards are resuming standard operations.
freeEvent15.message=%s, the release of prisoners is complete. Each was escorted out under heavy\
  \ guard, and no incidents occurred during the operation. While this eases the strain on the\
  \ facility, we remain acutely aware of the potential consequences of their return to enemy\
  \ forces.
freeEvent16.message=%s, the transfer of prisoners has been completed successfully. The process went\
  \ according to plan, and the remaining detainees have been compliant since the release. The\
  \ facility is back within capacity, and the guards are reporting improved morale.
freeEvent17.message=%s, we've completed the prisoner release. While the immediate overcrowding\
  \ issue has been resolved, some of my men have expressed concern that we may have released\
  \ valuable assets back to the enemy. Nevertheless, the facility is stable for now.
freeEvent18.message=%s, prisoners have been released into enemy custody. While this decision has\
  \ brought relief to the holding areas, it's clear the remaining population is still watching\
  \ closely. The operation proceeded without incident, but the tension in the air remains palpable.
freeEvent19.message=%s, we've released some prisoners as instructed. The process was conducted\
  \ under strict oversight, ensuring compliance from the remaining detainees. We're maintaining\
  \ heightened vigilance to ensure this release doesn't embolden the remaining population.
freeEvent20.message=%s, we've released some prisoners. Many were barely able to walk, their bodies\
  \ frail from confinement. The look in their eyes spoke volumes - fear, anger, and the haunting\
  \ emptiness of souls broken by captivity. The operation is complete, but the weight of what we've\
  \ witnessed remains heavy.
freeEvent21.message=%s, prisoners have been freed. Their gaunt faces and trembling hands were a\
  \ stark reminder of the suffering they've endured. Some whispered words of home as they stepped\
  \ out, others said nothing at all. The guards are shaken; this wasn't an easy task.
freeEvent22.message=%s, we've carried out the prisoner release. Their condition is\
  \ harrowing - emaciated, covered in bruises, and barely clinging to what humanity remains. Some\
  \ clutched photographs or trinkets as they shuffled out, shadows of the warriors they once were.
freeEvent23.message=%s, the release of prisoners has been completed. Their state was worse than\
  \ expected - sunken eyes, skeletal frames, and the unmistakable marks of prolonged suffering. Some\
  \ cried as they left, others stared blankly ahead. This is a grim chapter for us all.
freeEvent24.message=%s, prisoners were freed today, though it feels like releasing ghosts. Their\
  \ bodies are wasted, their minds distant. Some guards avoided looking at them directly, ashamed\
  \ of the conditions we allowed to persist. The task is done, but the memory will linger.
freeEvent25.message=%s, we've released the prisoners. Their silent, hollow stares told us\
  \ everything we needed to know about their time here. A few clung to each other as they walked\
  \ out, their camaraderie the only thing keeping them from falling apart entirely.
freeEvent26.message=%s, the release of prisoners is complete. The sight of them leaving - many\
  \ limping, others being carried - was gut-wrenching. Their frailty and the haunted looks on their\
  \ faces left no doubt about the toll of captivity. It's a scene none of us will forget.
freeEvent27.message=%s, as ordered, prisoners were released today. Their gaunt frames and unsteady\
  \ steps were a chilling reminder of what captivity has done to them. Some guards muttered prayers\
  \ as they watched them go, grappling with the horrors we've witnessed firsthand.
freeEvent28.message=%s, the release of prisoners has been completed. The holding cells are quieter\
  \ now, but the memory of their suffering hangs heavy. Their skeletal forms and the marks of\
  \ restraint are a testament to the grim reality of war. We'll carry this burden long after\
  \ they've gone.
freeEvent29.message=%s, prisoners were freed today. Their condition was devastating - sunken cheeks,\
  \ scars both old and new, and a silence that seemed louder than any scream. The sight visibly\
  \ shook even my guards. The task is done, but the cost is something we'll all carry.
freeEvent30.message=%s, the prisoner release was completed, but it wasn't without incident. Some\
  \ prisoners refused to leave, claiming they had no homes to return to, while others argued\
  \ violently about who deserved freedom. Guards had to intervene multiple times to prevent\
  \ serious altercations.
freeEvent31.message=%s, prisoners were released, but the process descended into chaos. Fights broke\
  \ out among the prisoners as they vied for supplies, and several guards sustained minor injuries\
  \ trying to separate them. Order has been restored, but tensions remain high.
freeEvent32.message=%s, the prisoner release has been carried out, but some prisoners sabotaged\
  \ their cells before leaving, damaging locks and equipment. The release caused an uproar among\
  \ the remaining population, who're now demanding to know when they will be freed.
freeEvent33.message=%s, as we prepared to release the prisoners, a group of them resisted, accusing\
  \ us of sending them to their deaths. Some of the remaining prisoners joined in the shouting,\
  \ forcing my guards to act swiftly to regain control. The operation continued, but tensions are\
  \ simmering.
freeEvent34.message=%s, prisoners were released today, but the operation nearly collapsed when one\
  \ prisoner attempted to take a guard hostage, claiming they deserved "revenge" for their\
  \ treatment. The guard was unharmed, and the prisoner was restrained, but the mood remains\
  \ hostile.
freeEvent35.message=%s, the prisoner release was delayed when we discovered one of them had\
  \ sabotaged the gate mechanism to prevent the process from moving forward. Repairs took several\
  \ hours, and while the release was eventually completed, the incident has put everyone on edge.
freeEvent36.message=%s, prisoners were released today, but the process was marred by hostility.\
  \ Many hurled insults at the guards, blaming them for the conditions they endured. A few had to\
  \ be forcibly removed from the premises, escalating tensions among those left behind.
freeEvent37.message=%s, prisoners were freed today, but the operation caused a stir among the\
  \ remaining population. Prisoners not chosen for release have begun muttering about favoritism\
  \ and threatening to disrupt future operations. The guards are keeping a close eye on the\
  \ situation.
freeEvent38.message=%s, as we released the prisoners, one collapsed during the final checks,\
  \ claiming severe illness. The guards had to call for medical assistance, delaying the operation\
  \ and causing frustration among the other prisoners. The release was eventually completed, but\
  \ the situation left many guards on edge.
freeEvent39.message=%s, prisoners were released, but the operation turned tense when several of\
  \ them openly declared their intention to rejoin the fight against us. Their defiance unsettled\
  \ my men, and their words riled up the remaining population. While the release was completed, the\
  \ atmosphere in the facility is now significantly more volatile.
freeEvent40.message=%s, during the prisoner release, two rival prisoners shocked everyone by\
  \ shaking hands as they walked out. Their followers cheered, and the remaining prisoners are\
  \ abuzz with rumors of an alliance forming outside the facility. The guards are uneasy, as this\
  \ could spell trouble for the future.
freeEvent41.message=%s, as we prepared to release the prisoners, the commotion allowed three others\
  \ to slip past the guards unnoticed. We've secured the facility, and the missing prisoners are\
  \ accounted for. This incident has raised questions about security protocols during operations\
  \ like this.
freeEvent42.message=%s, the release of prisoners nearly failed when one of them detonated a hidden\
  \ explosive device just outside the perimeter, damaging the gates and a holding cell. The\
  \ prisoner claimed it was a "farewell gift." While the others left without incident, tensions in\
  \ the facility are high.
freeEvent43.message=%s, during the prisoner release, one of them suddenly collapsed and died before\
  \ they could leave. The cause is unclear, though initial signs point to malnutrition or\
  \ exhaustion. The incident delayed the operation, and the remaining prisoners are spreading\
  \ rumors of foul play.
freeEvent44.message=%s, as they were released, a group of prisoners held up scraps of fabric\
  \ stitched together into their faction's banner, chanting slogans of defiance. The display\
  \ enraged some of the remaining prisoners, leading to scuffles in the holding area. Guards\
  \ intervened to prevent further escalation.
freeEvent45.message=%s, prisoners were released, but not before conducting an eerie ritual in the\
  \ holding area. They marked their faces with soot, spoke in hushed chants, and vowed revenge\
  \ before leaving. My guards are deeply unsettled, and the remaining prisoners are whispering\
  \ about what the ritual meant.
freeEvent46.message=%s, during the prisoner release, guards discovered that two individuals\
  \ attempting to leave weren't on the release list. They had swapped identification with others\
  \ in the cells. The imposters were detained, but the real prisoners meant for release remain\
  \ unaccounted for, and we're conducting a headcount to determine their whereabouts
freeEvent47.message=%s, prisoners were released, but one left behind a chilling message scrawled on\
  \ the wall of their cell: "We'll meet again in the ashes." The guards are rattled, and the\
  \ remaining prisoners seem energized by the act. The situation in the holding area is growing\
  \ tense.
freeEvent48.message=%s, during the release, one guard was found attempting to leave disguised as a\
  \ detainee. When questioned, they confessed to trying to desert under the guise of the operation.\
  \ The situation was handled discreetly, but the remaining guards are questioning their loyalty to\
  \ the mission.
freeEvent49.message=%s, prisoners were freed today, but the operation took an emotional turn when\
  \ one of them spotted a guard they recognized from a past battle. Tensions flared, and the two\
  \ nearly came to blows before the situation was de-escalated. The release was completed, but the\
  \ incident has left both parties visibly shaken.

executeEvent0.message=%s, the prisoners have been executed as per your orders. We isolated them in\
  \ the eastern storage hangar to ensure no civilians or non-essential personnel were present. Each\
  \ was dealt with quickly and efficiently, minimizing unnecessary commotion.
executeEvent1.message=<p>%s, the task is done, but I'll be honest - I didn't sign up for this. These\
  \ were just warriors who surrendered when the odds turned. Some of them begged, sir. I kept it\
  \ clean, no unnecessary pain, but this sits heavy.</p>\
  <p>The team's quiet now. Nobody's saying much, but I can see it on their faces. If this is the\
  \ new norm for our outfit, we might need to start asking ourselves who we're becoming.</p>
executeEvent2.message=%s, the prisoners have been eliminated as instructed. Execution took place in\
  \ the quarry, far from camp, ensuring no witnesses or disruptions. Disposal is handled; no\
  \ evidence remains.
executeEvent3.message=<p>%s, prisoners are no longer an issue. Execution was carried out in a\
  \ controlled manner behind the east perimeter. No complications arose, and the cleanup team has\
  \ finished their part.</p>\
  <p>Recommend avoiding this site for at least 48 hours while residual traces are dealt with.\
  \ Moving forward, it might be worth considering alternative methods to minimize resource use.</p>
executeEvent4.message=<p>%s, it's done. I don't like it, but it's done. You should know some of\
  \ these folks weren't even combatants anymore - they barely put up a fight. But hey, I'm\
  \ sure your spreadsheets say it makes sense to treat prisoners like liabilities.</p>\
  <p>If this is where we're headed as a company, I need to think about whether I belong here.</p>
executeEvent5.message=%s, the prisoners have been executed as per your directive. I ensured it was\
  \ handled as cleanly and professionally as possible. That said, I feel it's my duty to express\
  \ concern over the potential fallout of such actions. News travels fast and this could harm our\
  \ reputation with future employers.
executeEvent6.message=%s, prisoners are taken care of. No mess, no fuss. One of them tried to talk\
  \ their way out, but we shut that down fast. No loose ends to worry about.
executeEvent7.message=<p>%s, the prisoners were dealt with, as you ordered. I carried out the task\
  \ personally, ensuring there was no unnecessary suffering. I'll be blunt - I don't know how the\
  \ team will respond to this long-term. Morale's already shaky, and this sort of thing has a way\
  \ of sticking with people.</p>\
  <p>I suggest we give the squad some downtime to process. I'll do what I can to keep things\
  \ steady.</p>
executeEvent8.message=%s, the prisoners are no longer a factor. I understand there may be\
  \ criticism, but let's be clear: they were a security risk. Even under guard, we couldn't\
  \ guarantee they wouldn't escape or sabotage our operations.
executeEvent9.message=%s, prisoners are handled. Nothing fancy, nothing drawn out - they're gone. Let\
  \ me know if there's anything else you need cleaned up.
executeEvent10.message=<p>%s, it's done. I can't say I feel good about it, but I don't suppose that\
  \ matters. They were defeated, powerless - part of me wonders what we achieve by killing men who've\
  \ already lost.</p>\
  <p>Still, I followed through because that's what you expect. Orders are orders, and I'm here to\
  \ do the job. I just hope this isn't the kind of thing that defines us moving forward.</p>
executeEvent11.message=<p>%s, the prisoners have been dealt with, but we encountered complications.\
  \ Two of them overpowered a guard and tried to escape before the execution. We neutralized them,\
  \ but one of our people took a knife to the leg. The rest were executed without further\
  \ incident.</p>\
  <p>Recommend reviewing security procedures to avoid future disruptions. Let me know if you need a\
  \ full report.</p>
executeEvent12.message=%s, we carried out the execution as ordered, but I've just received\
  \ confirmation that one of the prisoners was an allied operative. Their credentials didn't check\
  \ out during processing. I take full responsibility for the oversight and await your instructions\
  \ on handling the fallout.
executeEvent13.message=%s, the task is complete, but there's a problem. Civilians from a nearby\
  \ settlement stumbled onto the site just after we began. They saw too much before we could\
  \ disperse them. If they decide to talk, this could blow back on us hard.
executeEvent14.message=%s, execution of the prisoners is done, but there were complications with\
  \ the team. One guard refused to participate outright and has since isolated himself from the\
  \ unit. Another is showing signs of severe distress. The task weighed heavily on all of us.
executeEvent15.message=<p>%s, the prisoners sabotaged their holding area before we moved them for\
  \ execution. They jammed the gate mechanism and damaged some of the restraints. It delayed the\
  \ operation by several hours, and we had to subdue them with stun rounds before proceeding.</p>\
  <p>The task is now complete, but it wasn't clean. I'll include a report on the equipment damage\
  \ for review.</p>
executeEvent16.message=%s, we began the execution as ordered, but conflicting instructions from\
  \ central command reached us mid-task, demanding the prisoners be kept alive for questioning. Two\
  \ were already dealt with before the halt. The remaining three have been restrained and returned\
  \ to holding.
executeEvent17.message=%s, the execution turned chaotic. While en route to the site, one of the\
  \ prisoners triggered a concealed explosive device during a struggle. Two guards were lightly\
  \ injured, and three prisoners were killed in the blast. The remaining two were executed\
  \ afterward, but the incident could draw unwanted attention.
executeEvent18.message=<p>%s, we encountered complications at the execution site. Sudden\
  \ bad weather forced us to abandon the operation mid-task. The high winds made\
  \ it unsafe to proceed, and transporting the prisoners back to base was risky, but they're\
  \ secured in the auxiliary bunker for now.</p>\
  <p>Once the storm clears, we'll carry out your orders.</p>
executeEvent19.message=<p>%s, the execution order was carried out, but it didn't go smoothly. One\
  \ of the prisoners incited the others to attack while being moved to the site. They managed to\
  \ lightly injure a guard and nearly succeeded in overpowering another. The mutiny was suppressed,\
  \ but it forced us to execute them on the spot instead of the planned location.</p>\
  <p>The situation is contained, and cleanup is underway. We'll double-check procedures to prevent\
  \ another incident.</p>
executeEvent20.message=<p>%s, it's done. I can't shake the sound they made, though - the pleading,\
  \ the sobbing. They knew what was coming, and that's what makes this so much worse. These weren't\
  \ combatants anymore. They were just... people.</p>\
  <p>We did what you asked, but I'll tell you this: some things don't wash off, no matter how many\
  \ orders you follow.</p>
executeEvent21.message=<p>%s, the prisoners are gone, but I can't stop thinking about the way they\
  \ looked at me. Not angry or defiant - just scared. One of them even said thank you when I offered\
  \ them water before the end. I keep asking myself if that was mercy or cruelty.</p>\
  <p>I don't know how to forget their faces.</p>
executeEvent22.message=<p>%s, the order has been carried out, but there was a problem. One of my\
  \ men refused to follow through. He broke down during the task, crying and shaking. I had to\
  \ finish their part myself. I'll handle discipline on my end, but... I think they're shattered.\
  \ This kind of thing breaks people.</p>\
  <p>Recommend pulling him from active duty for now.</p>
executeEvent23.message=<p>%s, the prisoners begged. They begged right up until the end. I didn't\
  \ want to listen, but it's impossible to block out. One of them swore they'd do anything if we\
  \ let them go - offered us intel, even credits. I carried out the task because I know the price of\
  \ disobedience.</p>\
  <p>But their voices keep echoing in my head. I did the job, but what kind of people does this\
  \ make us?</p>
executeEvent24.message=<p>%s, the job is done. It's quiet here now - too quiet. No one on the team is\
  \ speaking, not even the usual chatter on comms. You can feel it hanging in the air, the weight\
  \ of what we just did.</p>\
  <p>I know this is part of the business, but today, it feels like we crossed a line that we can't\
  \ uncross.</p>
executeEvent25.message=<p>%s, the last prisoner was unarmed, kneeling, and crying. They didn't even\
  \ resist, just asked to see their family one last time. I... I made sure it was quick, but it\
  \ didn't feel like mercy. It felt like murder.</p>\
  <p>I know we have reasons for this, but it's starting to feel like we're no better than the\
  \ people we're fighting.</p>
executeEvent26.message=<p>%s, it's done. The bodies have been disposed of, but the team is falling\
  \ apart. Two guards are talking about leaving the company, saying they can't handle this kind of\
  \ work. Another hasn't said a word since it happened.</p>\
  <p>If we keep giving orders like this, sir, we'll lose more than just soldiers - we'll lose our\
  \ humanity.</p>
executeEvent27.message=<p>%s, one of the prisoners asked if they could pray before we executed\
  \ them. I allowed it, thinking it might bring them peace. Instead, it tore the team apart\
  \ emotionally. Some of us couldn't look away. One guard even started crying.</p>\
  <p>The task was completed, but it left us all shaken. This isn't just killing enemies - it's\
  \ killing hope.</p>
executeEvent28.message=<p>%s, the prisoners are gone. Their last words won't leave me. One cursed\
  \ us, one begged, and another just kept saying, "It's not fair." I thought I was hardened to this\
  \ kind of thing, but something about this order feels... wrong.</p>\
  <p>We carried it out because that's what we do, but I don't know how much more of this the\
  \ team - or I - can take.</p>
executeEvent29.message=<p>%s, it's done. I followed through personally, just like you asked. I\
  \ washed my hands afterward, but I can still feel the blood. It doesn't matter how many times I\
  \ tell myself they were enemies - there's something deeply wrong about killing people who can't\
  \ fight back.</p>\
  <p>I don't know if I'm the person you think I am, but I'll keep trying to be.</p>
executeEvent30.message=<p>%s, it's over, but the walk back felt endless. None of us said a word.\
  \ The prisoners were crying, shouting, some just staring, resigned. When it was done, all I could\
  \ hear was the wind.</p>\
  <p>I know we've done worse things in combat, but this feels different. It wasn't war - it was\
  \ slaughter. The guards under my command will follow orders, but today I think we lost a piece of\
  \ ourselves.</p>\
  <p>I'll follow your lead, as always, but I had to tell you what this cost us.</p>
executeEvent31.message=%s, it's done, but the screams won't stop. They didn't go quietly, sir. Some\
  \ of them cried for their families, others screamed until their voices broke. Even when it was\
  \ over, the echoes felt louder than the gunshots.
executeEvent32.message=<p>%s, it's done. One of them asked if their mother would find out what\
  \ happened to them. I told them no. I lied. Then I pulled the trigger.</p>\
  <p>Whatever these orders accomplish, I hope you're ready to live with them. Because I'm not sure\
  \ if I can.</p>
executeEvent33.message=<p>%s, it's done, but not without incident. Half the team refused to go\
  \ through with it, and the others forced them aside to finish the job. There was shouting,\
  \ cursing, even a fistfight before it was over. These weren't soldiers - it was like watching\
  \ animals tear each other apart.</p>\
  <p>I'm not sure if the team will ever recover from this. Maybe none of us will.</p>
executeEvent34.message=<p>%s, they knew what was coming before we even lined them up. Some tried to\
  \ joke, saying, "Make it quick." Others just knelt, trembling, as if they were already dead. The\
  \ worst part was the silence afterward, the sound of boots on blood-soaked ground.</p>\
  <p>We followed orders, but it felt like a massacre.</p>
executeEvent35.message=<p>%s, one of my men broke down halfway through, sobbing as they pulled the\
  \ trigger. I had to step in and finish their part. Now they're curled up in a corner of the\
  \ barracks, shaking like a child.</p>\
  <p>You can give us orders, but you can't make us forget what we've done.</p>
executeEvent36.message=<p>%s, one of the prisoners offered me everything - credits, intel, even their\
  \ own house - if I spared them. They were shaking so hard they could barely speak. I carried out\
  \ your orders anyway, but I'll never forget the way their voice cracked as they begged.</p>\
  <p>Whatever we gained today, it wasn't worth this.</p>
executeEvent37.message=<p>%s, it's done, but I'll never forget the way they looked at me in those\
  \ final moments. Not hatred, not defiance - just confusion. Like they couldn't believe we were the\
  \ ones doing this to them.</p>\
  <p>I keep asking myself: when we became monsters?</p>
executeEvent38.message=<p>%s, the execution site was a horror show. We dug a trench and lined them\
  \ up. When it was over, we had to push the bodies into the pit with a loader. The stench, the\
  \ blood - it's burned into my senses.</p>
executeEvent39.message=<p>%s, one of the prisoners started singing. It was a slow, mournful\
  \ song - something about home. The others joined in, even as we raised our weapons. The sound\
  \ didn't stop until the last one fell.</p>\
  <p>I've never heard anything so beautiful, and I hope I never do again.</p>
executeEvent40.message=<p>%s, it's done, but I have to ask: what do we tell ourselves to justify\
  \ this? That they were enemies? That they would've done the same to us? I've killed men on the\
  \ battlefield, but this wasn't war. This was slaughter, plain and simple.</p>\
  <p>The blood's on my hands now, but I hope it haunts you too.</p>
executeEvent41.message=<p>%s, we moved the prisoners to the site as ordered, but the conditions\
  \ were brutal. The march was longer than expected, and we had no water to spare. When some\
  \ collapsed, the guards shot them on the spot to keep the others moving.</p>\
  <p>By the time we reached the site, half were dead already. The ones who made it didn't even\
  \ resist - they were too weak. This wasn't an execution. It was slow, grinding death.</p>
executeEvent42.message=<p>%s, the task is complete. We took the prisoners into the forest, one by\
  \ one, and finished it there. I thought this would feel efficient, but instead, it was drawn out\
  \ and sickening. Each one realized what was happening when the sound of gunfire reached them.</p>\
  <p>The bodies are buried, but the stench lingers. We've buried more than people today, sir. We've\
  \ buried our humanity.
executeEvent43.message=<p>%s, the prisoners were executed, but the guards got carried away.\
  \ Civilians who were suspected of aiding them - women, children, the elderly - were rounded up as\
  \ well. By the time I realized what was happening, our firing squads were already at work.</p>\
  <p>This was chaos, sir. There was no justice here, just blood. I'll submit a report, but I don't\
  \ know if we can clean this one up.</p>
executeEvent44.message=<p>%s, the prisoners are dead, but this wasn't an execution - it was a\
  \ massacre. Some of the guards recognized them as the ones who ambushed our supply convoy last\
  \ month. They didn't wait for an order - they started shooting, laughing, and kicking the bodies\
  \ when it was over.</p>\
  <p>I tried to restore discipline, but it was too late. This was about vengeance, not orders.</p>
executeEvent45.message=<p>%s, the prisoners were executed, but some of the guards took it too far.\
  \ Before the task was complete, they... I won't put the details in writing, but what happened\
  \ before their deaths was nothing short of barbaric.</p>\
  <p>If this comes to light, it won't just destroy the company's reputation - it'll destroy us.</p>
executeEvent46.message=<p>%s, by the time we reached the prisoners, they were too weak to stand.\
  \ Whoever was supposed to feed them failed, and they hadn't eaten in days. Most of them were\
  \ delirious, begging for water, food, anything.</p>\
  <p>We carried out the execution anyway, but this wasn't punishment - it was a mercy killing. What's\
  \ the point of this?</p>
executeEvent47.message=<p>%s, the executions took hours. We lined them up in groups, forced them to\
  \ kneel, and shot them one at a time. By the end, one of the guards dropped their weapon and\
  \ started screaming. Another tried to run into the forest to escape the sight of it all.</p>\
  <p>The rest of us finished the job, but I'm not sure any of us will ever come back from this.</p>
executeEvent48.message=<p>%s, it's done. We didn't just execute them; we erased them. No records,\
  \ no graves, no witnesses. It's as if they never existed.</p>\
  <p>My men are shaken. Some of them whispered about what happens when our turn comes - when we're\
  \ deemed expendable, too.</p>
executeEvent49.message=<p>%s, your instructions to delay the execution for "psychological impact"\
  \ worked too well. The prisoners were made to dig their own graves, standing by as we pretended\
  \ to debate their fate. Some collapsed, crying, begging. One tried to throw themselves on our\
  \ rifles to end it early.</p>\
  <p>When we finally carried it out, it wasn't just them who broke. Two guards started shaking so\
  \ badly they couldn't hold their weapons, and another swore they'd never take another order like\
  \ this again. We followed through, but at a cost I'm not sure if this team will survive.</p>

eventMinor0.message=%s, we've just had an incident in the holding area. Two groups of prisoners got into\

eventMinor4.message=%s, we've got a situation with the prisoners complaining about the rations, saying\
  \ they're insufficient. A handful of them have refused to eat and are demanding changes before\
  \ they cooperate. So far, it's contained, but this could escalate if more prisoners join in.\
  \ Requesting guidance on how to proceed - do we negotiate, enforce compliance, or handle this\
  \ another way?
responseMinorA4.button=Give them extra rations
responseMinorA4.tooltip=Better-fed prisoners are less likely to cause problems.

responseMinorC4.button=Investigate the supply line
responseMinorC4.tooltip=Check with your quartermaster - are the prisoners being shorted?

eventMinor5.message=%s, we've uncovered a growing contraband trade among the prisoners. They're\
  \ exchanging scraps of mech parts, trinkets, and even messages. So far, it looks harmless, but\
  \ the scale is increasing, and we're concerned it might lead to something bigger. Recommend\

eventMinor6.message=%s, one of my guards has reported feeling drained after extended shifts managing\
  \ the prisoners, particularly with the recent uptick in unruly behavior. Morale across the\
  \ security team seems to be slipping - some of the others are showing signs of frustration as well.\

eventMinor7.message=%s, a prisoner is stirring up trouble in the holding area. They've been loudly\
  \ proclaiming that their "rescue is imminent," and it's starting to catch the attention of other\
  \ prisoners. I'm concerned his defiance might inspire further unrest if we don't\

responseMinorC7.tooltip=His words will ring hollow when no rescue arrives.

eventMinor8.message=%s, one of the prisoners is claiming to have experience repairing mechs. They've\
  \ offered to assist in exchange for improved rations and better living conditions. Could be an\
  \ opportunity to make use of their skills, but there's always the risk they're overstating their\
  \ abilities - or worse, planning something. Recommend evaluating their background and skills before\
  \ making a decision. Let me know how you want to proceed.
responseMinorA8.button=Use his skills
responseMinorA8.tooltip=Allow him limited access to a workshop under heavy supervision.
responseMinorB8.button=Keep him locked up
responseMinorB8.tooltip=It's too risky to trust a prisoner with that kind of access.
responseMinorC8.button=Test his knowledge
responseMinorC8.tooltip=Ask him a series of questions to gauge his expertise.

eventMinor9.message=%s, several prisoners have come down with unexplained symptoms - weakness, coughing,\
  \ and fatigue. I'm concerned it could spread, but the prisoners are blaming the\
  \ conditions in the holding cells. We've isolated the affected individuals for now, but we may\
  \ need to investigate further to rule out a larger issue. Requesting advice on next steps to\
  \ contain this and maintain order.
responseMinorA9.button=Quarantine the sick
responseMinorA9.tooltip=Prevent further spread by isolating the afflicted prisoners.
responseMinorB9.button=Improve their conditions
responseMinorB9.tooltip=Allow better ventilation and clean water to improve health.
responseMinorC9.button=Wait it out
responseMinorC9.tooltip=Let nature take its course - this could reduce the number of prisoners causing trouble.

eventMinor10.message=%s, we've got a situation involving one of the prisoners and a crew member. The\
  \ prisoner recognized them from a previous campaign, and the two exchanged some tense words.\
  \ Sounds like there's some unresolved history that could cause friction if it escalates.\
  \ Recommend keeping them separated for now and determining if this history poses a security risk.\
  \ Let me know how you want to handle it.
responseMinorA10.button=Let them sort it out
responseMinorA10.tooltip=Personal matters aren't your concern.

responseMinorC10.button=Separate them immediately
responseMinorC10.tooltip=Avoid further conflict by assigning them to different areas.

eventMinor11.message=%s, we've discovered crude graffiti on the walls of the holding cells. It's an\
  \ unflattering depiction of you, accompanied by slogans promoting rebellion. While it's likely\
  \ meant to rile up the other prisoners, it's also a sign that tensions might be higher than we\
  \ realized. We've cleaned it up, but we recommend increased vigilance in the holding area to\
  \ prevent further incidents. Your guidance on next steps would be appreciated.
responseMinorA11.button=Clean it up

eventMinor12.message=%s, a group of prisoners has started holding loud, daily prayer sessions. While\
  \ they haven't caused any direct trouble, the noise is disrupting the other prisoners, and we're\
  \ beginning to see some friction between the groups. We can try to mediate or enforce\
  \ restrictions, but we'll need your decision on how to proceed to avoid further conflicts.

responseMinorA12.tooltip=Religious freedom shouldn't be curtailed, as long as it doesn't cause problems.

responseMinorC12.button=Ban it outright
responseMinorC12.tooltip=No religious practices on your watch - it's too divisive.

eventMinor13.message=%s, two prisoners were caught bartering a pack of cigarettes for what appears to be\
  \ "sensitive information" regarding our unit's operations. I've overheard parts of the\
  \ conversation, and it's clear this isn't just idle talk. We've separated the prisoners for now,\

responseMinorC13.tooltip=It's probably just rumors; no harm done.

eventMinor14.message=%s, a captured officer is refusing to share quarters with enlisted prisoners,\
  \ saying it's beneath their dignity. The enlisted prisoners are becoming agitated, seeing it as\
  \ favoritism and unfair treatment. The tension is starting to escalate, and we may need to\
  \ intervene before it becomes a larger issue. Suggest determining whether to enforce equal\
  \ conditions or provide separate accommodations for the officer. Awaiting your orders.

responseMinorC14.tooltip=Subtly pit the groups against each other to keep them distracted.

eventMinor15.message=%s, we've discovered some prisoners running a dice-based gambling game, using\
  \ scraps of metal as currency. So far, it seems harmless, but we're not sure if letting it\
  \ continue might lead to disputes or cause bigger problems later. Do you want us to shut it down\
  \ now or monitor it for the time being? Awaiting your guidance.
responseMinorA15.button=Break it up
responseMinorA15.tooltip=Gambling could lead to fights; it's not worth the risk.
responseMinorB15.button=Let it continue
responseMinorB15.tooltip=Harmless fun might keep morale from dropping too low.
responseMinorC15.button=Tax the winnings
responseMinorC15.tooltip=Use it as a way to assert control over the prisoners.

eventMinor16.message=%s, one of my men has been observed chatting a bit too amicably with the\

responseMinorC16.tooltip=Is this a simple mistake, or is the guard being manipulated?

eventMinor17.message=%s, one of the prisoners has been sobbing uncontrollably during the night,\
  \ disturbing the others. Some prisoners are mocking the outburst, while others seem genuinely\
  \ concerned. The noise is starting to cause unrest in the holding cells. We can isolate the\
  \ prisoner for the sake of order or investigate further to determine if there's something deeper\

responseMinorC17.button=Silence them
responseMinorC17.tooltip=Order the guards to restore order, no matter the method.

eventMinor18.message=%s, we've discovered a stash of propaganda leaflets hidden among the prisoners'\
  \ possessions. It's unclear whether they're being used to boost morale or as part of an\
  \ undercover effort. Either way, this could pose a risk if it spreads. We've confiscated the\

responseMinorB18.button=Interrogate the source

eventMinor19.message=%s, the prisoners have started singing old war songs, loudly and in unison. We're\
  \ not sure if it's just a morale booster or if it's meant to serve as some kind of signal. It's\
  \ causing a stir in the holding area, and we're monitoring the situation closely. Recommend\
  \ deciding whether to let it continue or take steps to disrupt it. Awaiting your guidance.
responseMinorA19.button=Ban singing
responseMinorA19.tooltip=Order the guards to stop any organized group activity.

responseMinorC19.tooltip=Record the lyrics to see if they include hidden messages.

eventMinor20.message=%s, a small group of prisoners is refusing their rations, claiming they're being\
  \ treated unfairly. Most of the prisoners are still eating, but there's a risk this could\
  \ escalate if their complaints gain traction. We can try addressing their concerns to defuse the\
  \ situation or take measures to ensure compliance. Requesting your decision on how to proceed.
responseMinorA20.button=Ignore it
responseMinorA20.tooltip=They'll eat when they're hungry enough.
responseMinorB20.button=Negotiate
responseMinorB20.tooltip=Speak to the ringleader and see what they want.
responseMinorC20.button=Force-feed them
responseMinorC20.tooltip=Demonstrate that resistance won't work here.

eventMinor21.message=%s, one of my guards overheard prisoners talking about "the perfect time" to make\
  \ a break for it. While it might just be idle chatter, it's enough to make the team uneasy. We've\
  \ increased vigilance for now, but it might be worth interrogating the prisoners involved or\

responseMinorC22.button=Punish them all
responseMinorC22.tooltip=Make the prisoners understand sabotage will not be tolerated.

eventMinor23.message=%s, one of the prisoners is claiming the enemy is planning a rescue operation. This\
  \ has started to raise hopes among the other prisoners, and it's making us uneasy. While\
  \ it could just be bluster, it's causing a noticeable shift in the atmosphere. Recommend taking\
  \ precautions to reinforce security and monitoring the prisoner closely. Awaiting your guidance.

responseMinorC23.tooltip=Just in case, increase security in key areas.

eventMinor24.message=%s, one of the prisoners is insisting they were captured by mistake, claiming to be\
  \ a civilian rather than a soldier. Their story sounds plausible, but we currently have no way to\
  \ verify it. This could be an attempt to manipulate us, or it might genuinely warrant further\
  \ investigation. Requesting guidance on how to proceed - whether to interrogate further, hold them,\

eventMinor25.message=%s, I've just intercepted a letter from a prisoner, written entirely in code. It's\
  \ addressed to someone outside the facility, but we haven't been able to determine its contents\
  \ yet. This could be an attempt to coordinate with outside forces or something less significant.\

  \ illness. We can't confirm the legitimacy of their symptoms yet, but we're concerned it\
  \ could spread to the crew if it's real. For now, we've isolated the affected prisoners, but we\

eventMinor27.message=%s, one of the prisoners just handed me a folded piece of paper shaped like a\
  \ bird. It appears harmless, but the gesture feels oddly symbolic, and we're unsure how\
  \ to interpret it. This could be a message, a distraction, or just an unusual display of\
  \ creativity. We'll keep an eye on the prisoner for any further behavior, but let us know if you\
  \ want us to take any specific actions.
responseMinorA27.button=Destroy it
responseMinorA27.tooltip=It's just paper, but better safe than sorry.
responseMinorB27.button=Ask what it means
responseMinorB27.tooltip=Speak to the prisoner and understand their intentions.
responseMinorC27.button=Keep it as a curiosity
responseMinorC27.tooltip=Add it to your collection of oddities.

eventMinor28.message=%s, the other guards have reported hearing strange metallic noises coming from the\
  \ holding area during the night. We haven't identified the source yet, but it's unusual enough to\
  \ raise concerns. It could be something innocuous, like environmental issues, or something\
  \ deliberate, like tampering or preparations for escape. Recommend conducting a thorough\
  \ inspection of the area to ensure everything is secure. Awaiting your guidance.
responseMinorA28.button=Inspect the cells
responseMinorA28.tooltip=Search thoroughly for contraband or escape attempts.
responseMinorB28.button=Ignore it

eventMinor29.message=%s, one of the prisoners is growing increasingly agitated, insisting that someone\
  \ on our crew is spying on them. While there's no evidence to support their claim, their paranoia\

responseMinorA29.tooltip=Assign a guard to reassure the prisoner.

responseMinorC29.tooltip=Paranoia is just a side effect of captivity.

eventMinor30.message=%s, we've discovered a half-dug tunnel hidden beneath one of the bunks in the\
  \ holding area. It's unclear how long they've been working on it or how many prisoners are\
  \ involved. We've sealed the area for now, but this suggests a coordinated escape attempt.\
  \ Recommend conducting a full sweep of the facility and interrogating key prisoners to uncover\
  \ the extent of the plan. Awaiting your orders.

responseMinorC30.tooltip=Use it as bait to catch escapees in the act.

eventMinor31.message=%s, one of the prisoners appears to have tamed a small rodent that's been sneaking\
  \ into the cells for food. While it seems harmless for now, it's unusual behavior, and we're\
  \ concerned it could be used to pass messages or contraband. I'm monitoring the\
  \ situation, but let us know if you want us to take further action.
responseMinorA31.button=Allow it
responseMinorA31.tooltip=Small comforts might keep morale stable.

  \ in the holding area. It's unclear how long it's been in the works or what the prisoners were\

eventMinor33.message=5s, one of the prisoners is claiming to be an undercover agent working for Command.\

responseMinorA33.button=Verify their claim

responseMinorC33.tooltip=See if they have actionable intel.

eventMinor34.message=%s, we've discovered a prisoner with a fresh burn scar in the shape of their\
  \ faction's crest. We're not sure if this was self-inflicted or done by another prisoner, but\
  \ it's likely meant as a symbol of loyalty or defiance. This could inspire solidarity among the\
  \ other prisoners or stir tensions in the holding area. Recommend monitoring the prisoner closely\
  \ and keeping an eye on their interactions. Let us know if further action is needed.
responseMinorA34.button=Investigate
responseMinorA34.tooltip=Who branded them, and why?
responseMinorB34.button=Treat the wound

# MAJOR
eventMajor0.message=%s, we have a mass breakout in progress! Prisoners are flooding through a\
  \ breach in the holding cell wall - they used stolen equipment and improvised explosives to blow\
  \ it open! Some of them are armed and engaging the guards, trying to fight their way out. We need\
  \ immediate reinforcements to contain this, or they're going to overwhelm us! Awaiting your\
  \ orders!
responseMajorA0.button=Lock down the perimeter
responseMajorA0.tooltip=Focus on preventing any prisoners from leaving the base, even if it costs lives.
responseMajorA0.success=%s, the perimeter lockdown was successful. No prisoners managed to escape,\
  \ though the operation was intense, with several guards sustaining injuries. The breach has been\
  \ secured, and the facility is back under control. The prisoners have been subdued, and order has\
  \ been restored.
responseMajorA0.failure=%s, despite our efforts to lock down the perimeter, several prisoners\
  \ managed to slip through in the chaos. The guards sustained heavy casualties holding the line,\
  \ and the breach caused significant damage. While the immediate threat has been contained, the\
  \ escapees are unaccounted for, and morale among the team is low.
responseMajorB0.button=Pursue escapees aggressively
responseMajorB0.tooltip=Send guards and combat units after fleeing prisoners at full force, risking\
  \ significant casualties.
responseMajorB0.success=%s, the aggressive pursuit paid off. The majority of the escapees have been\
  \ recaptured, and the rest were neutralized. The operation was costly, with several guards\
  \ injured, but the breakout has been thwarted. Order is restored, and the remaining prisoners are\
  \ under control.
responseMajorB0.failure=%s, the aggressive pursuit failed. The escapees scattered in multiple\
  \ directions, overwhelming our forces. Several guards were lost or injured in the pursuit, and a\
  \ significant number of prisoners is still at large. The breach has been secured, but the\
  \ breakout's impact will take time to recover from.
responseMajorC0.button=Cut your losses
responseMajorC0.tooltip=Focus on containing the remaining prisoners while letting some escape.
responseMajorC0.success=%s, cutting our losses allowed us to focus on securing the remaining\
  \ prisoners and minimizing casualties. While some prisoners escaped, the breach has been\
  \ repaired, and the facility is stable. The guards are regrouping, and the remaining population\
  \ has been subdued.
responseMajorC0.failure=%s, cutting our losses only emboldened the prisoners. While we secured the\
  \ remaining population, the number of escapees was higher than expected. The facility is intact,\
  \ but morale among the guards has plummeted, and tensions are high among the remaining prisoners.\
  \ Stability is fragile at best.

eventMajor1.message=%s, the prisoners have erupted into a full-scale riot! They've armed themselves\
  \ with makeshift weapons - pipes, sharp tools, even shards of metal ripped from the holding area.\
  \ We've fallen back to the control room. The barricades won't hold for long, and they're trying\
  \ to force their way in! We need backup and orders immediately, or we're going to lose control\
  \ of the entire facility!
responseMajorA1.button=Deploy riot suppression teams
responseMajorA1.tooltip=Use stun weapons and tear gas to bring the prisoners under control.
responseMajorA1.success=%s, the riot suppression teams successfully subdued the prisoners. Stun\
  \ weapons and tear gas brought the situation under control, and all hostiles have been\
  \ restrained. There were minor injuries on both sides, but no major casualties. The facility is\
  \ secure, and order has been fully restored.
responseMajorA1.failure=%s, the riot suppression teams were overwhelmed. The prisoners resisted\
  \ tear gas and makeshift barricades, overrunning critical areas before retreating guards could\
  \ regroup. Several guards sustained injuries, and the holding area has suffered significant\
  \ damage. The riot has been quelled, but the aftermath will require a full assessment.
responseMajorB1.button=Call in reinforcements
responseMajorB1.tooltip=Deploy combat units to decisively end the riot, even if it means\
  \ significant bloodshed.
responseMajorB1.success=%s, reinforcements successfully ended the riot. The combat units acted\
  \ decisively, overpowering the prisoners and restoring full control of the facility. There were\
  \ some injuries among the prisoners, including a few severe cases, but the situation is resolved,\
  \ and the facility is secure once more.
responseMajorB1.failure=%s, reinforcements engaged the prisoners, but the riot escalated further\
  \ before it could be stopped. Heavy fighting caused significant damage to the facility, and\
  \ multiple injuries were reported on both sides. While control has been regained, the cost was\
  \ high, and parts of the compound are heavily compromised.
responseMajorC1.button=Offer terms of surrender
responseMajorC1.tooltip=Promise improved conditions to quell the violence, knowing it might\
  \ embolden the prisoners later.
responseMajorC1.success=%s, the prisoners accepted the terms of surrender, and the riot has been\
  \ defused. They disarmed and returned to their cells after receiving assurances of improved\
  \ conditions. While the situation is under control, tensions in the facility remain high, and the\
  \ guards are on edge following the incident.
responseMajorC1.failure=%s, the prisoners rejected the terms of surrender and escalated their\
  \ assault before the riot was finally subdued. They seized additional sections of the facility\
  \ and inflicted serious damage before eventually being overpowered. While the immediate threat\
  \ has passed, the holding area is left in disarray.

eventMajor2.message=%s, we've found a well-liked prisoner dead in their cell - murdered! There's a\
  \ note pinned to their chest claiming responsibility. The other prisoners are furious, and\
  \ they're blaming us for letting this happen. They're threatening revenge unless the killer is\
  \ identified immediately! Tensions are about to explode - we need instructions on how to defuse\
  \ this before it turns into a bloodbath!
responseMajorA2.button=Launch a full investigation
responseMajorA2.tooltip=Dedicate resources to finding the murderer and addressing prisoner grievances.
responseMajorA2.success=%s, the investigation was a success. The murderer was identified and taken\
  \ into custody, and the other prisoners are satisfied that justice has been served. While\
  \ tensions remain, the swift and thorough response has calmed the situation. The facility is\
  \ stable, and order has been restored.
responseMajorA2.failure=%s, the investigation failed to uncover the murderer. Despite our efforts,\
  \ the lack of results has only fueled prisoner anger, and their distrust in us has deepened.\
  \ While the immediate violence has subsided, tensions remain dangerously high, and the prisoners\
  \ are still on edge.
responseMajorB2.button=Blame a scapegoat
responseMajorB2.tooltip=Pin the murder on a convenient suspect to restore order quickly, even if\
  \ they're innocent.
responseMajorB2.success=%s, a convenient suspect was blamed for the murder, and the prisoners\
  \ accepted the explanation. The scapegoat was removed from the population, and tensions have\
  \ eased significantly. While the situation is now under control, some guards have voiced concerns\
  \ about the ethics of this decision.
responseMajorB2.failure=%s, the attempt to blame a scapegoat backfired. The prisoners saw through\
  \ the ruse and are more furious than ever. They believe we're hiding the real murderer, and their\
  \ demands for justice have escalated. Order has been restored for now, but the unrest is far\
  \ from over.
responseMajorC2.button=Punish the rest
responseMajorC2.tooltip=Crack down hard on the other prisoners, regardless of whether they were involved.
responseMajorC2.success=%s, a harsh crackdown on the prisoners has restored order. While many of\
  \ them are bitter about the collective punishment, the display of authority has subdued any\
  \ immediate threats. The facility is secure, though tensions remain beneath the surface.
responseMajorC2.failure=%s, the crackdown sparked even more chaos. The prisoners resisted fiercely,\
  \ resulting in widespread injuries and significant damage to the facility. While the riot has\
  \ been quelled, the cost was high, and the population is now even more defiant. Order has been\
  \ restored, but the situation remains volatile.

eventMajor3.message=%s, a fire has broken out in one of the prisoner cellblocks! We're\
  \ scrambling to respond, but with limited personnel, we're struggling to contain the blaze.\
  \ Prisoners are screaming for help as the flames spread - some are trying to break free in the\
  \ chaos, while others are turning on each other to survive. The cause of the fire is still\
  \ unclear - could be an accident or sabotage. We need immediate orders on how to\
  \ prioritize containment, rescues, and security!
responseMajorA3.button=Save as many as possible
responseMajorA3.tooltip=Focus your efforts on rescuing prisoners and guards, even if it means\
  \ losing critical resources or risking a breakout.
responseMajorA3.success=%s, we prioritized rescues, and many prisoners and guards were saved from\
  \ the blaze. Though we lost some critical resources and sustained damage to the facility, the\
  \ majority of lives were spared. The fire has been extinguished, and order is being\
  \ reestablished. While the situation was costly, the effort has restored some trust among the\
  \ prisoners.
responseMajorA3.failure=%s, espite our best efforts to rescue as many as possible, the fire spread\
  \ too quickly. Several prisoners and guards couldn't be saved, and critical resources were\
  \ destroyed in the chaos. While the blaze is now extinguished, the loss of life and damage to the\
  \ facility have left morale in shambles.
responseMajorB3.button=Secure the perimeter
responseMajorB3.tooltip=Lock down the camp to prevent any escape attempts, even if it means\
  \ sacrificing lives in the cellblock.
responseMajorB3.success=%s, the perimeter has been secured, and no prisoners managed to escape\
  \ during the chaos. While several prisoners perished in the fire, the facility remains intact,\
  \ and critical infrastructure has been preserved. Order has been restored, but the loss of life\
  \ has heightened tensions within the population.
responseMajorB3.failure=%s, we locked down the perimeter, but the decision came at a heavy cost.\
  \ Many prisoners and even some guards succumbed to the fire while we focused on security, and\
  \ critical parts of the facility were severely damaged. While no one escaped, the backlash among\
  \ the surviving prisoners is intense, and trust in our leadership has eroded.
responseMajorC3.button=Investigate first
responseMajorC3.tooltip=Prioritize finding the source of the fire - sabotage could indicate a\
  \ larger conspiracy among the prisoners.
responseMajorC3.success=%s, we prioritized investigating the fire and uncovered evidence of\
  \ deliberate sabotage by a faction of prisoners. While the delay in response meant more lives and\
  \ resources were lost, the discovery of this plot has allowed us to identify key culprits and\
  \ prevent future incidents. The fire is extinguished, and the perpetrators have been detained.
responseMajorC3.failure=%s, the investigation delayed our response to the fire, resulting in\
  \ significant loss of life and damage to the facility. To make matters worse, we found no\
  \ conclusive evidence of sabotage, and the cause of the fire remains uncertain. The surviving\
  \ prisoners are furious, and the facility is in disarray. This failure has only added fuel to the\
  \ unrest.

eventMajor4.message=%s, several personnel have fallen ill - turns out their rations were poisoned!\
  \ Investigation reveals a prisoner managed to sabotage the supply lines, and we have reason to\
  \ believe there's more poison hidden somewhere. The affected personnel aren't in a critical\
  \ condition, but panic is spreading. We need immediate instructions to secure the supplies\
  \ and contain this threat before it gets worse!
responseMajorA4.button=Shut down food distribution
responseMajorA4.tooltip=Halt all meals temporarily and investigate thoroughly, even if it angers\
  \ the prisoners.
responseMajorA4.success=%s, food distribution was immediately halted, and a thorough investigation\
  \ uncovered additional poisoned rations hidden in the supply. The prisoners were angered by the\
  \ disruption, but no further cases of poisoning occurred, and panic has subsided. Security\
  \ protocols have been reinforced, and the situation is now under control.
responseMajorA4.failure=%s, shutting down food distribution caused widespread outrage among the\
  \ prisoners, sparking unrest and even minor skirmishes in the holding area. Despite the\
  \ disruption, we failed to locate additional poison in the supply. Tensions remain high, and the\
  \ facility's stability is precarious.
responseMajorB4.button=Punish the suspected saboteur
responseMajorB4.tooltip=Identify and punish a likely suspect to deter further attempts.
responseMajorB4.success=%s, the suspected saboteur was identified and punished. The decisive action\
  \ has sent a clear message to the prisoners, deterring further attempts to sabotage the rations.\
  \ The situation has calmed, and food distribution has resumed under tighter security measures.\
  \ Panic has been contained, and the affected personnel are recovering.
responseMajorB4.failure=%s, punishing the suspected saboteur backfired - our evidence was\
  \ inconclusive, and the prisoners are now accusing us of scapegoating. Distrust has spread, and\
  \ some prisoners are refusing their rations entirely. While no further poison has been found, the\
  \ facility remains on edge, and tensions are rising.
responseMajorC4.button=Increase food inspections
responseMajorC4.tooltip=Focus on longer-term security measures while addressing the immediate crisis.
responseMajorC4.success=%s, food inspections were ramped up immediately, and we identified and\
  \ removed several poisoned rations from circulation. While the process delayed food distribution,\
  \ it reassured the prisoners and guards alike. The affected personnel are recovering, and the\
  \ enhanced security measures have stabilized the situation.
responseMajorC4.failure=%s, increased food inspections failed to uncover any additional poison, and\
  \ the delays in distribution only added to the tension. Some prisoners are accusing us of\
  \ negligence, while others are growing restless from the prolonged restrictions. The threat of\
  \ further sabotage remains unresolved, and morale is low across the facility.

eventMajor5.message=%s, we have an emergency! During a routine inspection, a group of prisoners\
  \ overpowered the guards and has taken one of my men hostage! They're demanding better\
  \ conditions and immediate release, threatening to kill the hostage if their demands aren't met.\
  \ The situation is extremely volatile, and we don't know how long we have to negotiate. We need\
  \ your orders immediately!
responseMajorA5.button=Negotiate for time
responseMajorA5.tooltip=Stall the prisoners with minor concessions while preparing a rescue operation.
responseMajorA5.success=%s, the negotiations bought us enough time to organize a successful rescue\
  \ operation. The hostage was freed with only minor injuries, and the prisoners involved have been\
  \ subdued and detained. While the situation was tense, the outcome was a success, and order has\
  \ been restored.
responseMajorA5.failure=%s, the negotiations stalled, and the prisoners used the delay to reinforce\
  \ their position. By the time we attempted the rescue, they executed the hostage and inflicted\
  \ heavy casualties on the assault team. The situation has been resolved, but at a devastating\
  \ cost to morale and trust in our ability to maintain control.
responseMajorB5.button=Storm the area
responseMajorB5.tooltip=Launch a risky assault to save the hostage, regardless of casualties.
responseMajorB5.success=%s, the assault team acted swiftly, overwhelming the prisoners and rescuing\
  \ the hostage. While there were minor injuries during the operation, the hostage was recovered\
  \ alive, and the prisoners responsible have been secured. The operation was a success, and the\
  \ facility is under control once again.
responseMajorB5.failure=%s, the assault to rescue the hostage failed. The prisoners killed the\
  \ hostage during the attack, and several guards were injured or killed in the chaos. Although the\
  \ prisoners were eventually subdued, the cost was high, and morale among the security team has\
  \ plummeted. The facility is secure, but the scars from this event will linger.
responseMajorC5.button=Refuse their demands outright
responseMajorC5.tooltip=Take a hardline stance, knowing the hostage's life may be lost.
responseMajorC5.success=%s, taking a hardline stance paid off. The prisoners hesitated and\
  \ ultimately released the hostage unharmed, fearing retaliation. The guards quickly subdued the\
  \ ringleaders, and the situation has been resolved without bloodshed. While tensions remain high,\
  \ the facility is stable, and our authority has been reinforced.
responseMajorC5.failure=%s, refusing their demands led to the worst outcome. The prisoners executed\
  \ the hostage and escalated their defiance, forcing guards to intervene with deadly force. The\
  \ situation was ultimately contained, but the loss of life and the display of violence have left\
  \ the facility in a state of shock.

eventMajor6.message=%s, a prisoner-planted explosive just detonated in a critical part of the\
  \ facility - the power generator has been hit! Systems are failing, and the blast has\
  \ thrown everything into chaos. The prisoners are using the confusion to launch a coordinated\

  \ reinforcements and immediate orders before the situation spirals completely out of control!
responseMajorA6.button=Secure critical areas
responseMajorA6.tooltip=Focus on protecting vital systems to prevent further damage, even if\
  \ prisoners escape.
responseMajorA6.success=%s, critical areas of the facility have been secured. While a few prisoners\
  \ managed to escape during the chaos, the guards successfully protected vital systems, preventing\
  \ further damage. The power generator is offline but intact enough to be repaired. The situation\
  \ is now under control, and the facility's stability has been preserved.
responseMajorA6.failure=%s, we focused on securing critical systems, but the effort came at a cost.\
  \ A large group of prisoners managed to escape in the confusion, and damage to the generator is\
  \ extensive. While the immediate threat has been contained, the facility is in disarray, and the\
  \ escapees are unaccounted for.
responseMajorB6.button=Pursue the saboteurs
responseMajorB6.tooltip=Send guards after the responsible prisoners, prioritizing retribution over\
  \ repairs.
responseMajorB6.success=%s, the guards tracked down and captured the saboteurs behind the\
  \ explosion. Their capture has prevented further coordinated attacks, though the effort left\
  \ other parts of the facility vulnerable. The damage to the generator is extensive, but with the\
  \ ringleaders in custody, the prisoners' momentum has been crushed, and order is being restored.
responseMajorB6.failure=%s, pursuing the saboteurs backfired. While the guards managed to apprehend\
  \ some of them, the delay in securing vital systems allowed the breakout to spiral out of\
  \ control. Many prisoners escaped, and the generator sustained catastrophic damage. The situation\
  \ is under control for now, but the losses are severe.
responseMajorC6.button=Call for reinforcements
responseMajorC6.tooltip=Bring in additional manpower to handle the chaos, though it may leave other\
  \ areas vulnerable.
responseMajorC6.success=%s, reinforcements arrived just in time to help contain the breakout and\
  \ stabilize the facility. The coordinated attack was repelled, and the majority of the prisoners\
  \ involved have been subdued or recaptured. The generator is damaged, but the facility is secure,\
  \ and order has been restored.
responseMajorC6.failure=%s, reinforcements arrived too late to prevent widespread chaos. By the\
  \ time they intervened, significant damage had been done to the generator, and many prisoners had\
  \ already escaped. While the facility has been stabilized, the aftermath of the breakout will\
  \ take considerable time and resources to address.

eventMajor7.message=%s, we've got a crisis - prisoners just carried out a public execution in the\
  \ holding area, claiming the victim was a collaborator. By the time we\
  \ arrived, it was too late to stop it. Now the prisoners are openly defiant, treating this as a\
  \ show of strength. Tensions are boiling over, and the situation could escalate into full-scale\
  \ violence at any moment. We need orders immediately - how do we contain this?
responseMajorA7.button=Punish the mob leaders
responseMajorA7.tooltip=Identify and publicly punish those responsible to reassert control.
responseMajorA7.success=%s, the mob leaders were identified and swiftly punished, sending a clear\
  \ message to the rest of the prisoners. While tensions remain high, the show of authority has\
  \ reasserted control over the population. The situation has been stabilized, and no further\
  \ violence has occurred.
responseMajorA7.failure=%s, our attempt to punish the mob leaders backfired. The prisoners\
  \ retaliated violently, escalating the situation into a full-blown riot. Several guards were\
  \ injured, and parts of the facility sustained damage before order was finally restored. The\
  \ aftermath has left the facility on edge and resources stretched thin.
responseMajorB7.button=Divide and isolate factions
responseMajorB7.tooltip=Separate prisoners based on alliances to reduce tensions, even if it\
  \ spreads your resources thin.
responseMajorB7.success=%s, faction leaders were identified, and the prisoners were divided and\
  \ isolated based on their alliances. The separation has reduced tensions significantly,\
  \ preventing further outbreaks of violence. While the approach has stretched our resources, the\
  \ facility is now stable, and control has been reestablished.
responseMajorB7.failure=%s, ividing the prisoners only created new flashpoints, as tensions flared\
  \ within the isolated groups. The strain on our resources made it difficult to maintain order,\
  \ and skirmishes broke out across multiple sections of the facility. The situation has been\
  \ contained, but the fractures among the population remain volatile.
responseMajorC7.button=Use this as a warning
responseMajorC7.tooltip=Let the execution stand as a grim reminder of what happens to traitors.
responseMajorC7.success=%s, we let the execution stand as a warning to the population, and the grim\
  \ message seems to have worked. The prisoners are subdued, recognizing the consequences of\
  \ defiance among their own. While this approach has left lingering unease, the facility is\
  \ secure, and no further incidents have occurred.
responseMajorC7.failure=%s, treating the execution as a warning backfired. Instead of deterring\
  \ unrest, it emboldened the prisoners, who now view it as a victory. Defiance is spreading, and\
  \ tensions in the facility are at an all-time high. While the situation hasn't escalated into\
  \ open violence yet, it's dangerously close.

eventMajor8.message=%s, we've just uncovered a horrifying situation - a neglected wing of the\
  \ compound was rediscovered after prisoners were mistakenly transferred there during a chaotic\
  \ intake process. Guards found emaciated bodies, skeletal prisoners barely clinging to life, and\
  \ others who didn't survive. The survivors are pleading for rescue and accusing us of abandoning\
  \ them. This could spiral into chaos if word spreads further. We need immediate orders on how to\
  \ handle this before it turns into a full-blown crisis.
responseMajorA8.button=Provide immediate aid
responseMajorA8.tooltip=Dedicate resources to saving the survivors, even if it strains your supplies.
responseMajorA8.success=%s, immediate aid was provided to the survivors, stabilizing their\
  \ condition. While this strained our supplies and personnel, the effort has quelled accusations\
  \ and restored a measure of trust among the prisoners. The situation has been contained, and\
  \ morale is recovering, though resources remain tight.
responseMajorA8.failure=%s, despite our efforts to provide aid, it was too late for many of the\
  \ prisoners. The survivors are resentful and spreading accusations of negligence, fueling unrest\
  \ in the facility. The strain on our supplies has left us vulnerable, and tensions are rising\
  \ among both prisoners and staff.
responseMajorB8.button=Hide the evidence
responseMajorB8.tooltip=Quietly cover up the incident to prevent morale loss or political fallout.
responseMajorB8.success=%s, the incident was quietly covered up. The bodies were removed, and the\
  \ surviving prisoners were integrated back into the general population under close observation.\
  \ No information has leaked, and the situation has been contained without further fallout. The\
  \ facility remains stable.
responseMajorB8.failure=%s, the attempt to cover up the incident failed. Word spread among the\
  \ prisoners before we could act, and now the population is furious, accusing us of hiding\
  \ atrocities. The backlash has destabilized the facility, and maintaining control will be\
  \ challenging in the days ahead.
responseMajorC8.button=Blame the prisoners
responseMajorC8.tooltip=Shift responsibility for the disaster onto the prisoners themselves to\
  \ maintain control over the remaining population.
responseMajorC8.success=%s, shifting responsibility to the prisoners has diffused blame from our\
  \ crew. By framing the incident as a result of infighting and poor organization among the\
  \ prisoners, we've avoided further accusations. While tensions remain, the population is subdued,\
  \ and the facility is stable for now.
responseMajorC8.failure=%s, blaming the prisoners only inflamed the situation. The survivors and\
  \ their allies have become openly defiant, accusing us of cruelty and negligence. The unrest is\
  \ spreading, and the situation is dangerously close to spiraling out of control. The facility is\
  \ on edge, and stability is tenuous.

eventMajor9.message=%s, we've got a major crisis - prisoners from rival groups have set aside their\
  \ differences and formed a united front against us! Their cooperation has allowed them to\
  \ overwhelm my guards and seize control of an entire holding wing. They're fortifying\
  \ their position and could spread further if we don't act fast. We need clear\
  \ orders on how to retake the area before this escalates even more!
responseMajorA9.button=Divide and conquer
responseMajorA9.tooltip=Exploit old rivalries to shatter the alliance from within.
responseMajorA9.success=%s, we exploited old rivalries among the prisoners, planting rumors and\
  \ sowing distrust within their alliance. The united front shattered as factions turned on each\
  \ other, allowing guards to retake the holding wing with minimal resistance. The facility is\
  \ secure, and tensions among the prisoners are back to manageable levels.
responseMajorA9.failure=%s, our attempts to divide the alliance failed. The prisoners saw through\
  \ the ploy and grew even more unified against us. They've tightened their defenses, and the\
  \ holding wing remains under their control. Regaining control required significant force.
responseMajorB9.button=Launch a full assault
responseMajorB9.tooltip=Retake the area with overwhelming force, even if it costs lives.
responseMajorB9.success=%s, the full assault succeeded. Guards overwhelmed the prisoners with\
  \ decisive force, retaking the holding wing. While there were casualties on both sides, the\
  \ operation reestablished control over the area, and the remaining prisoners have been subdued.\
  \ The facility is stable once again.
responseMajorB9.failure=%s, the full assault failed. The prisoners were heavily fortified, and the\
  \ guards suffered significant casualties during the operation. Despite the effort, the holding\
  \ wing remains under their control, and morale among our personnel has taken a severe hit. The\
  \ prisoners are emboldened, and the situation is critical.
responseMajorC9.button=Cut them off
responseMajorC9.tooltip=Seal the wing and starve the prisoners of resources, forcing them to\
  \ surrender over time.
responseMajorC9.success=%s, we sealed off the holding wing, cutting the prisoners off from\
  \ resources and reinforcements. Over time, their supplies dwindled, and they were forced to\
  \ surrender. The operation was a success, with minimal casualties, and the facility is back under\
  \ our control.
responseMajorC9.failure=%s, cutting off the holding wing backfired. The prisoners found ways to\
  \ fortify their position and scavenged resources to sustain themselves. Meanwhile, unrest spread\
  \ among the rest of the population, who view this as proof of our cruelty. The situation is\
  \ deteriorating rapidly, and the facility's stability is now at risk.
