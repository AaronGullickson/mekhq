eventMinor11.message=%s, we've discovered crude graffiti on the walls of the holding cells. It's an\
  \ unflattering depiction of you, accompanied by slogans promoting rebellion. While it's likely\
  \ meant to rile up the other prisoners, it's also a sign that tensions might be higher than we\

eventMinor15.message=%s, we've discovered some prisoners running a dice-based gambling game, using\
  \ scraps of metal as currency. So far, it seems harmless, but we're not sure if letting it\

eventMinor23.message=%s, one of the prisoners is claiming the enemy is planning a rescue operation. This\
