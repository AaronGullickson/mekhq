abstractMutinyConclusionNoVictorDescription.text=<html><body style='width: 400px;'>The end of the mutiny is marked by the grim and harrowing silence that follows the chaos. As the final shots are fired and the last cries of conflict fade, both loyalists and mutineers lay scattered across the blood-streaked corridors and shattered control rooms. The air is thick with the acrid smell of spent ammunition and the faint, metallic tang of blood.\
  <br>\
  <br>The bridge, once a hub of coordinated effort and command, now stands eerily silent. Consoles flicker with sporadic life, displaying warnings and error messages, unattended and ignored. The captain's chair, a symbol of authority and leadership, is slumped with the lifeless body of its last occupant, a silent testament to the brutality that transpired. Engineering sections, critical for the DropShip's operation, are littered with debris and the remains of desperate combatants who fought fiercely to control the heart of the vessel.\
  <br>\
  <br>With no survivors to tend to the wounded or repair the damage, the DropShip is silent, a ghost ship. Its engines, either critically damaged or left unattended, sputter intermittently, sending the ship into a slow, aimless spin. Systems that once maintained life support, navigation, and communication flicker uncertainly, threatening to fail completely and plunge the vessel into darkness and silence.\
  <br>\
  <br>The catastrophic conclusion of the mutiny not only claims the lives of every crew member but also condemns the DropShip itself to a slow, inevitable demise. Without a guiding hand, the ship becomes a drifting tomb, a chilling reminder of the destructive power of internal conflict. Units, supplies, and the dreams of those who once served aboard are now lost to the void, their mission abandoned and their fate sealed by the ultimate cost of their rebellion.\
  <br>\
  <br>In the aftermath, the once-cohesive unit is no more, and the echoes of their struggle may only be discovered by a passing salvage crew or another vessel, drawn by the silent distress beacon that still pulses, a lonely signal of life extinguished by the very hands meant to protect it.\</body></html>

abstractMutinyConclusionLoyalistVictory.text=<html><body style='width: 400px;'>The end of the mutiny sees the loyalists victorious but at great cost. The last gunfire and shouts fade into silence as the loyal crew stands amidst the aftermath. Bodies of mutineers and loyalists lie scattered through narrow corridors and control rooms, a stark testament to the brutal conflict.\
  <br>\
  <br>The bridge, now under loyalist control, is a wreckage of broken consoles and bloodied bodies. The commander, battered but resolute, surveys casualty reports and system alerts that flicker on the screens. In engineering, loyalist engineers work tirelessly to stabilize critical systems and prevent further catastrophe.\
  <br>\
  <br>Throughout the ship, loyalists secure vital areas and tend to the wounded in a makeshift medbay. Exhaustion and grief mark their faces, reflecting the heavy toll of victory. The unit's cohesion and morale are deeply scarred, and trust among the crew is fragile.</body></html>

abstractMutinyConclusionMutineerVictory.text=<html><body style='width: 400px;'>The end of the mutiny is marked by tense silence as the last echoes of gunfire fade. The mutineers, weary but determined, stand amidst the wreckage of fierce battles in narrow corridors and crucial control rooms. Loyalist crew members lie scattered, their resistance crushed by the mutineers.\
  <br>\
  <br>The bridge, now under mutineer control, is a scene of broken consoles and bloodied bodies. The leader of the mutineers takes the commander's chair, surveying the aftermath with grim satisfaction. Displays flicker with damage reports and system alerts, evidence of the intense struggle to seize command.\
  <br>\
  <br>In engineering, mutineers work frantically to stabilize critical systems, their efforts a desperate attempt to prevent catastrophic failure. The hum of machinery and clatter of tools create a frantic symphony as they patch up the worst damage.\
  <br>\
  <br>Throughout the ship, mutineers secure vital areas and tend to their wounded in a makeshift medbay. Exhaustion and grief mark their faces, reflecting the heavy toll of victory. The unit's cohesion and morale are shattered, trust is fragile, and the shadow of betrayal looms large.\
  <br>\
  <br>As they set a new course, haunted by the memory of their conflict and the high price of rebellion, the future remains uncertain.</body></html>

abstractMutinyCampaignEnd.text=<html><body style='width: 400px;'>Following the mutiny and its grim resolution, your campaign has reached its abrupt and somber end.\
  <br>\
  <br>%s is now a scarred monument to internal conflict, its personnel decimated. The survivors left standing among the wreckage.\
  <br>\
  <br>The once-vibrant corridors of the DropShip are eerily silent, with only the hum of damaged systems breaking the quiet. The victory, whether by loyalists or mutineers, is pyrrhic. The survivors are weary, their faces etched with the toll of battle and the weight of their decisions. However, what happens next is a story told without you.\
