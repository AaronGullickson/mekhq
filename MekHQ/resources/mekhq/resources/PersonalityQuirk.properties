ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.label=Constantly Adjusting Clothes
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.0.COMBATANT=Every strap, every buckle, every seal - Barry checks them all,\
  \ again and again. His battle gear is adjusted with the same precision no matter the circumstance.\
  \ He claims it's discipline, but in truth, it's a ritual to calm his nerves.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry never feels quite right in his gear, always tugging at a\
  \ strap or shifting his gloves even mid-firefight. To his lance, it's just a quirk, but those\
  \ who've fought beside him long enough know: Barry is always waiting for disaster. Maybe it's\
  \ because he's seen too many comrades get vaped by a laser, or maybe it's just instinct. Either\
  \ way, when Barry starts adjusting his gear a little too often, it's time to take cover.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.2.COMBATANT=His gear never fits right. His pistol holster is always too\
  \ tight or too loose. His boots rub raw against his heels. It doesn't matter what uniform he\
  \ wears or what battlefield he's dropped into - Barry will never be comfortable. Some say he's\
  \ fidgety. Others think he's just waiting for the day he won't need to adjust anything ever\
  \ again. Because dead men don't need to fix their collars.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry insists that every uniform, flight suit, and cooling vest\
  \ is properly fitted before deployment. If he sees a tech in a grease-stained jumpsuit with an\
  \ undone collar, they'll get an earful - because a ragged soldier is a careless one, and\
  \ carelessness gets people killed.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.1.CIVILIAN=Between adjusting his sleeves and straightening his belt, Barry\
  \ runs logistics with unsettling speed. He can load a dropship in record time while never once\
  \ standing still. Some think he's just high-strung, but the company keeps running because of him.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry believes if everything is in its place - uniforms pressed,\
  \ boots polished, reports properly filed - maybe, just maybe, fate won't notice him. But in a\
  \ military unit, paperwork means nothing when a JumpShip goes missing, or when the employer\
  \ decides your contract isn't profitable enough to honor. Barry keeps adjusting his cuffs,\
  \ knowing it won't save him.

AFFECTIONATE.label=Overly Affectionate
AFFECTIONATE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry fights like a demon and hugs like a bear. Before a\
  \ mission, he's patting backs, ruffling hair, and making sure everyone knows they're his 'battle\
  \ brothers and sisters.' Even in the middle of a firefight, he'll crack jokes and shout\
  \ encouragement over comms. Some love him for it - others just tolerate the inevitable post-mission\
  \ shoulder squeeze.
AFFECTIONATE.description.1.COMBATANT=In the modern military, most people keep their distance - losing\
  \ friends is inevitable. Not Barry. He remembers every name, every fallen comrade, and he'll\
  \ make damn sure no one in his unit dies feeling alone. Whether it's an arm around your shoulders\
  \ before battle or a whispered, "We've got this," before charging into hell, Barry refuses to let\
  \ the universe turn him cold.
AFFECTIONATE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's always there, hand on your shoulder, telling you that\
  \ everything's gonna be okay. He calls everyone "brother" or "sister," and he means it. But those\
  \ who've been around long enough notice something eerie - he's always closest to the ones who don't\
  \ make it back. It's almost like he can sense when it's someone's last fight. And when he gives\
  \ you that tight, lingering hug before deployment... well, you better hope he's wrong.
AFFECTIONATE.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry runs things like a family dinner table, always checking if\
  \ you've eaten, gotten enough rest, and - somehow - if you're warm enough. He hands out coffee with a\
  \ reassuring pat on the back and calls the greenest recruits 'kiddo' regardless of their age.\
  \ Even the grizzled veterans can't stay mad at him for long.
AFFECTIONATE.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry means well, but his tendency to clap people on the back,\
  \ sling an arm over their shoulders, or hug them when they least expect it has led to more than\
  \ one awkward moment. His warmth is rare, but let's be real - there's a reason HR gave him another\
  \ warning after that last Christmas party.
AFFECTIONATE.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry makes sure everyone feels wanted, needed, remembered. He\
  \ laughs with the fresh-faced recruits, gives the mechanics a warm shoulder squeeze after a long\
  \ shift, and never lets a MechWarrior take off without a genuine, "Be safe, okay?" But in this\
  \ line of work, people disappear - sometimes violently, sometimes just gone between contracts.\
  \ Barry remembers all their names. And he never stops grieving.

APOLOGETIC.label=Overly Apologetic
APOLOGETIC.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry is a competent warrior, but you'd never know it from the\
  \ way he apologizes after every shot. Missed a target? "Sorry about that." Nailed a headshot?\
  \ "Hope that wasn't too brutal." Even enemy pilots getting cored out by his autocannon might hear\
  \ a muttered "Didn't mean for it to go that way..." over comms.
APOLOGETIC.description.1.COMBATANT=No matter where he is, Barry can't stop apologizing. He'll say\
  \ "Sorry" for calling a warning too late, for calling it too early, for asking a question, and\
  \ sometimes just for existing. He fights hard, but his lance suspects he'd apologize to an\
  \ inbound PPC if given the chance.
APOLOGETIC.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry says "Sorry" like a prayer. He apologizes to the comrades\
  \ he couldn't save, to the enemies he had to kill, and to himself for believing the fighting\
  \ would ever end. Maybe he's already dead inside, or maybe he's just waiting for the battlefield\
  \ to make it official. Either way, when Barry starts whispering apologies mid-firefight, it's a\
  \ bad omen.
APOLOGETIC.description.0.CIVILIAN=Need ammo? "Sorry it took so long." Ration packs taste like\
  \ cardboard? "I'm really sorry about that." DropShip delayed by pirate activity? "Wish I could\
  \ fix it, truly." Barry apologizes for things that aren't his fault, but his relentless\
  \ politeness means people rarely yell at him - at least, not for long.
APOLOGETIC.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry is good at his job, but he'll never admit it. No matter how\
  \ well he manages things, he acts like a single misstep could doom the entire unit. He'll\
  \ triple-check orders, then apologize for bothering people about them. If you thank him, he'll\
  \ probably just say, "Oh, it wasn't much, really. Sorry if it was."
APOLOGETIC.description.2.CIVILIAN=Military life is brutal, and when things go wrong, someone has to\
  \ take the fall. Barry, somehow, always ends up volunteering. A shipment lost to raiders? "I\
  \ should've arranged better security." A contract gone bad? "I should've checked the fine print."\
  \ Even when it's not his fault, Barry takes the weight of the unit's sins - and sooner or later,\
  \ the universe will demand payment.

BOOKWORM.label=Always Reading
BOOKWORM.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's never without a datapad, whether it's field manuals,\
  \ After-Action Reports, or ancient texts on combined-arms strategy. He absorbs tactics like a\
  \ sponge, always searching for an edge. If you see him flipping through a history book before a\
  \ mission, don't interrupt - he's probably looking for a maneuver that saved some long-dead\
  \ general's skin.
BOOKWORM.description.1.COMBATANT=Between battles, Barry's nose is buried in a book - anything from\
  \ war poetry to pre-spaceflight philosophy. He claims it helps him make sense of the chaos, but\
  \ his squad worries when he starts quoting lines about fate and inevitability right before a\
  \ drop. The last thing you want to hear before a firefight is someone musing about existential\
  \ doom.
BOOKWORM.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry keeps a small, battered notebook tucked inside his vest.\
  \ It isn't a journal, and it isn't for poetry. It's a list of names - every comrade he's lost,\
  \ every enemy he's killed, every contract that ended in blood. He reads it every night,\
  \ whispering each name like a mantra. One day, he knows, someone else will be reading his.
BOOKWORM.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry can fix a supply chain issue in minutes, negotiate a\
  \ contract loophole, and recite the complete corporate history of the Inner Sphere - mostly because\
  \ he reads everything. Need a regulation cited or an obscure planetary fact? Barry's already\
  \ flipping to the right page.
BOOKWORM.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry's always reading, but the problem is when.\
  \ Mid-conversation? Eyes still on the book. Being addressed by the commander? "Yeah, yeah, one\
  \ sec." He'll draft an action plan while reading an old science-fiction novel and still do a\
  \ better job than anyone else, but it's an open question if he even knows what planet he's on\
  \ half the time.
BOOKWORM.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry reads because he has to. He studies ancient Terran\
  \ records, disaster reports, the economic collapses of entire planets. He says it's to learn from\
  \ the past, but deep down, he knows the truth - history doesn't repeat, it rhymes. And in this\
  \ business, the verse always ends in war, ruin, and silence.

CALENDAR.label=Keeps a Personal Calendar
CALENDAR.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry has every mission, training session, and equipment check\
  \ meticulously scheduled. He even sets reminders for "Check Ammo Reserves" and "Pre-Battle\
  \ Meditation." His lance laughs at him - until they realize he's never the one caught off-guard\
  \ when an op gets moved up at the last minute.
CALENDAR.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's calendar isn't just for logistics; it's full of birthdays,\
  \ contract anniversaries, and even the day he first met each member of his lance. He makes sure\
  \ to slip a small gift or a kind word to comrades on their special days. Some find it endearing,\
  \ others unsettling - because in this line of work, remembering dates also means remembering who\
  \ didn't make it to the next one.
CALENDAR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's calendar is obsessive. He logs every mission, every\
  \ deployment, every injury. He tracks trends - how long the average warrior lasts in the unit; how\
  \ many more battles his lance can take before the odds catch up. He's seen the numbers, and he\
  \ knows. There's a date circled in red, deep in the future. He won't say what it means, but he\
  \ checks it every day.
CALENDAR.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry's calendar isn't just personal - it's the real company\
  \ schedule. Payroll deadlines, JumpShip departures, contract negotiations - he's got it all mapped\
  \ out. If the commander wants to know when they're leaving, they don't ask the XO. They ask Barry.
CALENDAR.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry believes mercenary life shouldn't be all death and logistics,\
  \ so he makes sure to schedule "Company Movie Night," "Optional Poker Tournament," and\
  \ "Morale-Boosting Happy Hour." Even the gruffest veterans roll their eyes at first - until they\
  \ find themselves actually looking forward to "Trivia Night, Hegemony Edition."
CALENDAR.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry keeps a calendar because someone has to. It tells him exactly\
  \ when the company's bank account will run dry, when their mechs will finally wear out, and when\
  \ their contracts will leave them stranded in hostile space. He keeps the bad news to himself for\
  \ now, but he's already penciled in "Final Dissolution of Unit" just in case.

CANDLES.label=Fond of Scented Candles
CANDLES.description.0.COMBATANT=The repair bays stink of sweat and burnt wiring, the barracks\
  \ always reek of gun oil, and the battlefield is worse. Barry fights the stink of war with an\
  \ arsenal of lavender, sandalwood, and citrus candles. His squadmates mock him - until they realize\
  \ his bunk actually smells nice.
CANDLES.description.1.COMBATANT=Before every battle, Barry lights a small candle in his\
  \ quarters or in the corner of a DropShip hangar. It's always the same scent, something that\
  \ reminds him of home - wherever that was. He doesn't talk about it, but those who've fought beside\
  \ him know: it's not just a habit. It's a tether, a way to remind himself there's still a world\
  \ beyond the blood and steel.
CANDLES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry used to share a tent, a bunk, or a barracks with someone\
  \ who loved scented candles. They're gone now, but their habit remains. Every time he lights one,\
  \ the memory lingers in the air like the smoke curling from the wick - fading, but never truly gone.
CANDLES.description.0.CIVILIAN=The company barracks are cold, impersonal, and smell like old\
  \ metal - but not Barry's office. His desk is lined with small candles, filling the air with warm\
  \ vanilla, crisp pine, or exotic spices from some world he barely remembers. Even the grizzled\
  \ veterans find themselves stopping by just to breathe for a moment.
CANDLES.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry's love for scented candles has nearly gotten him banned\
  \ from multiple compounds. Between fire suppression alarms going off and that one time a candle\
  \ nearly ignited a munitions crate, he's been forced to compromise. Now he sticks to flameless\
  \ aromatherapy diffusers - but deep down, he knows it's not the same.
CANDLES.description.2.CIVILIAN=The scent of blood, burning cities, and melted armor haunt\
  \ Barry's memories. He learned long ago that no amount of scrubbing can erase the past. But a \
  candle - one simple, flickering light - can mask it for just a little while. And when the wax burns\
  \ down to nothing, he knows it's time to light another.

CHEWING_GUM.label=Always Chewing Gum
CHEWING_GUM.description.0.COMBATANT=Explosions shake the ground, autocannon fire rips through\
  \ cover, and Barry just keeps chewing. His squad swears he's unflappable - always calm, always\
  \ focused, grinding his teeth through minty freshness while delivering precise, lethal fire. If\
  \ Barry ever spits his gum out in the middle of a fight, then you know things are bad.
CHEWING_GUM.description.1.COMBATANT=Whether he's gunning down enemy infantry, dodging PPC blasts,\
  \ or lining up a shot, Barry's always got a smirk and a fresh stick of gum. He pops it in like a\
  \ pre-battle ritual, as if to say, This is just another day at the office. And honestly? He\
  \ fights like he believes it.
CHEWING_GUM.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't chew gum for fun. He chews because if he stops,\
  \ his jaw clenches, his stomach knots, and the ghosts get a little louder. He's tasted blood,\
  \ smoke, and the bitter air of burning cities. But as long as he's chewing, as long as he\
  \ focuses on that single, repetitive motion, he can pretend - just for a little while - that things\
  \ are normal.
CHEWING_GUM.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry juggles manifests, schedules, and disputes all while\
  \ chewing a steady rhythm of bubblegum-flavored efficiency. If he's blowing bubbles in the middle\
  \ of a meeting, it means he's already outmaneuvered the other side.
CHEWING_GUM.description.1.CIVILIAN=The constant snapping, popping, and chewing drives half the\
  \ company insane, but Barry refuses to stop. "It helps me focus," he says. And, somehow, it does.\
  \ He's the only one who can keep track of deployment schedules, cargo weights, and which planet\
  \ their next contract is on without breaking a sweat.
CHEWING_GUM.description.2.CIVILIAN=There's not much softness in the military life - just rations,\
  \ burnt coffee, and the bitter taste of war. But gum? Gum reminds Barry that there used to be\
  \ shops, vendors, normalcy. Every time he unwraps a fresh stick, he pretends, for just a second,\
  \ that he's somewhere else. Somewhere safer. Somewhere that still exists.

CHRONIC_LATENESS.label=Chronically Late
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry is never on time, but somehow, he always shows up just\
  \ when things are about to go south. Whether it's rolling onto the battlefield in a hail of\
  \ fire, dropping into the fray seconds before an ambush, or sprinting to his post as the DropShip\
  \ doors open, he's living proof that "better late than never" sometimes does work.
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's alarms are always ignored, his comms are always buzzing\
  \ with angry messages, and he's always the last one suited up. No one knows how he still manages\
  \ to be an effective warrior, but somehow, he gets away with it. The day his luck runs out,\
  \ though, is going to be spectacularly bad.
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.2.COMBATANT=No matter how hard he tries, Barry is always one step behind.\
  \ He arrived late to the briefing where his lance was assigned their final mission. He reached\
  \ the rendezvous just in time to see the DropShip leaving without him. He sprinted to save his\
  \ best friend, but by the time he got there, the only thing left was blood. He keeps running,\
  \ keeps trying - but in the end, he's always too late.
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry is late to everything - staff meetings, supply runs,\
  \ deadlines - but when he finally shows up, he solves problems like no one else. Need a deadline\
  \ renegotiated? A missing shipment found? A discrepancy fixed? Just give him five more minutes\
  \ (or maybe thirty).
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.1.CIVILIAN=Everyone in the company has learned to lie to Barry about\
  \ meeting times. If the briefing is at 0800, he's told 0730. If a shuttle departs at noon, he\
  \ gets an 1130 memo. He knows they do this. He still manages to be late.
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry wasn't always this way. He used to be punctual, precise.\
  \ But after a while, what's the point? Military units fall apart, contracts get broken, people\
  \ die. Schedules are just an illusion of control in a universe that doesn't care. So Barry lets\
  \ the minutes slip by, knowing deep down that, one day, there won't be any more time left.

CLEANER.label=Compulsive Cleaner
CLEANER.description.0.COMBATANT=Whether it's scrubbing down his gear, wiping every speck of dust\
  \ off his boots, or meticulously cleaning his bunk after a long mission, Barry keeps everything\
  \ spotless. He claims that "clean gear is reliable gear," and to his credit, he looks good.
CLEANER.description.1.COMBATANT=Before every mission, Barry polishes his sidearm, tightens every\
  \ strap, and scrubs the inside of his helmet until it gleams. Some say it's just ritual; others\
  \ think it's his way of dealing with the chaos of combat. Either way, his unit knows that when\
  \ Barry starts cleaning, it's a sign he's mentally preparing to face hell.
CLEANER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry is constantly wiping down his gear, scrubbing his hands, and\
  \ sweeping his bunk. No matter how much he cleans, though, the stains are never really gone. He's\
  \ haunted by the blood he couldn't wash away - whether it's his comrades', his enemies', or his\
  \ own, even he's no longer sure.
CLEANER.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry's workspace is a model of precision. Tools are perfectly\
  \ arranged, spare parts gleam under harsh lighting, and every surface is dust-free. Anyone who\
  \ messes up his spotless system is likely to get a mop shoved into their hands and a long lecture\
  \ on "basic respect for shared spaces."
CLEANER.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry can't stand clutter, grime, or grease stains, which makes him\
  \ a constant presence in the repair bay. Whether he's scrubbing someone else's tools or wiping\
  \ down DropShip corridors, he's always cleaning something - and somehow, that relentless energy\
  \ keeps the whole operation running smoother.
CLEANER.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry cleans because it's the only thing left that he can control.\
  \ He polishes the windows even though they look out on a dead world. He scrubs the briefing table\
  \ even though no one's gathered around it in weeks. One by one, the others are leaving, dying, or\
  \ simply giving up. Barry just keeps cleaning, as if he can scrub away the decay of a company\
  \ that's already rotting from within.

COLLECTOR.label=Collects Odd Items
COLLECTOR.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry has a knack for finding strange things in the ruins of\
  \ battlefields - enemy insignias, discarded dog tags, fragments of Mech armor with odd markings.\
  \ His squad jokes that he could start a museum, but they've all seen him pull out a bent bullet\
  \ casing mid-fight, rub it like a lucky charm, and somehow walk away unscathed.
COLLECTOR.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry collects junk. Old playing cards, broken holodisks,\
  \ half-melted action figures. He swears each one has a story, even if it's just "found it in a\
  \ burned-out bunker." Some say it's a harmless habit, but others worry - because Barry never throws\
  \ anything away, even the stuff that should be forgotten.
COLLECTOR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry keeps a little bag tied inside his jacket, filled with\
  \ small trinkets - items he's taken from the dead. A ration tin from a fallen comrade, an enemy\
  \ soldier's wristwatch, a child's toy found in the wreckage of a bombed-out city. He doesn't know\
  \ why he does it, only that every time he loses someone, he has to take something to remember\
  \ them. His collection keeps growing. It always grows.
COLLECTOR.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry's supply closet isn't just stocked with spare parts and\
  \ ammo - it's got weird stuff. A pre-Hegemony coffee mug, an old recruitment poster, a stuffed\
  \ animal with one button eye. No one knows where he gets this junk, but somehow, he always has\
  \ exactly what you didn't realize you needed.
COLLECTOR.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry picks up odd relics from every planet the company\
  \ visits - outdated currency, antique tools, even random street signs. "Every piece of junk tells a\
  \ story," he says. But when someone asks why he's so obsessed with lost things, he just shrugs.\
  \ "If we don't remember them, who will?"
COLLECTOR.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry never leaves a battlefield without taking\
  \ something - sometimes a spent shell casing, sometimes a piece of fabric, sometimes a nameplate\
  \ from a wrecked Mech. It started as a way to remember fallen comrades, but now? He keeps things\
  \ from everyone - raiders, civilians, people whose names he never even knew. His collection is a\
  \ graveyard in miniature, and it will never be full.

COMPETITIVE_NATURE.label=Competitive Nature
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he has to win. Whether it's in\
  \ a bar brawl, a shooting contest, or a live-fire battlefield, he takes every engagement as a\
  \ personal challenge. He's the first to volunteer for high-risk missions just to prove he's the\
  \ best. One day, that attitude is going to get him killed.
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry turns everything into a competition. Who gets the\
  \ most confirmed kills? Who takes out the enemy Mech fastest? Who can pee the furthest? If\
  \ there's a scoreboard, real or imaginary, Barry's keeping track. His squad puts up with\
  \ it - mostly because, despite all the trash talk, he always buys the first round of drinks.
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just want to win - he needs to. When things\
  \ get desperate, he doesn't hesitate. He'll break rules, take risks no sane person would, leave\
  \ others behind if it means claiming victory. Because in the end, in war, second place is just\
  \ another name for dead.
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry doesn't just file reports - he races against himself\
  \ to get them done faster than last time. Supply chains? He optimizes them like a battlefield\
  \ tactician. Budget allocations? He takes bets on how much he can shave off unnecessary expenses.\
  \ If you challenge him to an efficiency contest, you will lose.
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.1.CIVILIAN=Poker night? Barry plays to win. PT drills? He'll run\
  \ extra laps just to prove he can. Even downtime isn't safe - he'll challenge you to arm wrestling,\
  \ trivia, or who can drink the most without passing out. The crew loves him, but sometimes they\
  \ wish he'd let something go just once.
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry tracks wins and losses, not just his own, but\
  \ everyone's. How many battles won, how many contracts failed, how many comrades lost. He used to\
  \ think if he could just get ahead, just win enough, it would mean something. But the names on\
  \ the "Losses" side of his ledger keep growing, and he's starting to realize - maybe, in this life,\
  \ nobody really wins.

COMPLIMENTS.label=Excessive Complimenter
COMPLIMENTS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry showers his teammates with praise, whether they just\
  \ pulled off a perfect ambush or simply reloaded their weapon without a jam. "Great shot! Perfect\
  \ footwork! Love the way you took cover behind that debris, textbook execution!" He's genuine\
  \ about it too - maybe too genuine. Even the most hardened veterans aren't sure how to respond when\
  \ he compliments their "exceptional battlefield posture."
COMPLIMENTS.description.1.COMBATANT=Enemy forces closing in? Barry still finds time to compliment\
  \ someone for their "magnificent trigger discipline" or the team's scout for "nailing that\
  \ stealthy approach." Some think it's just his way of keeping morale up. Others think he's\
  \ stalling, trying to keep himself from processing the violence happening around him.
COMPLIMENTS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's compliments aren't just encouragement. They're last\
  \ words in disguise. He wants the last thing someone hears before they die to be something good.\
  \ His lance knows that when he stops fighting to say, "You really handled that situation well,"\
  \ it means he doesn't think they're making it out alive.
COMPLIMENTS.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry thinks everyone is amazing. The way the MechTechs replace\
  \ a fusion engine? "Brilliant." The way the warriors dock their Mechs? "Precision work." The way\
  \ the cook managed to make ration packs almost edible? "A culinary triumph." He hands out praise\
  \ so fast and frequently that no one's sure if he's being sarcastic - but he's absolutely serious.
COMPLIMENTS.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry can make even the most jaded warriors uncomfortable with\
  \ his relentless positivity. Military companies are built on cynicism, but Barry? Barry will\
  \ look a tired, underpaid, underappreciated AsTech dead in the eye and say, "You're the backbone\
  \ of this operation. Without you, we're nothing." And damn it - sometimes that's exactly what they\
  \ need to hear.
COMPLIMENTS.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry gives compliments like his life depends on it. Maybe, in a\
  \ way, it does. He wants to believe that if he acknowledges every small act of skill, courage, or\
  \ kindness, it matters. That in a universe of endless war and forgotten lives, someone's efforts\
  \ will be seen. Because if they aren't, if people are just lost and unremembered - then what was\
  \ the point of it all?

DAYDREAMER.label=Prone to Daydreaming
DAYDREAMER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry has a habit of staring off into the distance, lost in\
  \ thoughts of battlefield maneuvers and hypothetical scenarios. "What if we used a pincer\
  \ formation, but with jump-capable units repositioning mid-battle?" he mutters, mid-firefight.\
  \ His ideas are often brilliant - if only he'd stop zoning out long enough to share them before\
  \ bullets start flying.
DAYDREAMER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry fights because he has to, but his mind is always\
  \ elsewhere - strolling through the jungles of some uncharted world, watching the sunrise over a\
  \ crystalline ocean, or fighting through a battlefield that isn't real, where no one dies and\
  \ every shot is just for sport. War has a way of pulling him back to reality, violently.
DAYDREAMER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry spends more and more time staring into nothing, lost in\
  \ memories of places he's never been, people he's never met. He flinches at explosions a little\
  \ less than he used to. He doesn't even notice the warnings blaring in his HUD anymore. One day,\
  \ he won't snap back at all - his mind will keep drifting while his body is torn apart by war.
DAYDREAMER.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry is great at his job - when he remembers he has one. One\
  \ second, he's calculating JumpShip fuel reserves; the next, he's staring at a loading crane,\
  \ imagining how much more efficient it would be if they redesigned the entire docking system.\
  \ Someone usually has to snap him out of it before he redesigns the payroll system instead.
DAYDREAMER.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry dreams of things beyond war: a better future, a life\
  \ outside of contracts and bloodshed, a world where people don't have to sell their lives for\
  \ money. He writes down these ideas in an old, worn notebook. No one knows if he actually\
  \ believes in them, or if it's just a way to distract himself from the reality of his work.
DAYDREAMER.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry reads old records, stories of lost worlds, of cities\
  \ untouched by war, of a time when life wasn't dictated by strategy and firepower. He dreams\
  \ about them, too - vivid, detailed dreams that feel more real than the dim, gray present. Maybe\
  \ it's just escapism. Or maybe, deep down, he knows he was born in the wrong century, and this\
  \ war-torn existence was never meant for him.

DOODLER.label=Compulsive Doodler
DOODLER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's field manual is covered in scribbles - little sketches of\
  \ battle formations, enemy Mech silhouettes, and doodled maps of planets he's never even been\
  \ to. His commanders are annoyed, but his squad swears that more than once, one of Barry's\
  \ absentminded sketches ended up being the key to surviving an operation.
DOODLER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's war journal is supposed to be for mission notes, but it's\
  \ filled with sketches of things not on the battlefield: towering trees from some distant world,\
  \ the face of a woman he can't quite remember, the endless stars above the DropShip bay. Maybe he\
  \ fights so one day he won't have to anymore.
DOODLER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry fills every spare scrap of paper with drawings - names carved\
  \ into ruined buildings, faces half-remembered, insignias from units that no longer exist. He\
  \ says he draws so he won't forget, but the way he looks at his sketches, like he's haunted by\
  \ them... maybe he already has.
DOODLER.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry's official reports always come back with little sketches in\
  \ the margins - better weapon mounting brackets, new DropShip layouts, a completely redesigned\
  \ coolant system. Some of his ideas are insane. Some get implemented. The tech crews have learned\
  \ to always check his notes
DOODLER.description.1.CIVILIAN=Briefings, budget reviews, deployment schedules - Barry listens,\
  \ technically, but his notepad is always filled with little cartoons of his comrades, absurdly\
  \ detailed Mech drawings, or a sketch of the commander looking way too serious. Half the company\
  \ keeps his doodles as personal trophies.
DOODLER.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry's doodles have changed. Once, they were harmless, funny little\
  \ scribbles. Now, they're battlefields reduced to smoldering craters, Mechs collapsing in fire,\
  \ DropShips breaking apart in orbit. When asked about them, he just shrugs. "I don't know," he\
  \ says. "Sometimes I feel like I'm just drawing what's going to happen."

DOOLITTLE.label=Talks to Animals
DOOLITTLE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry will stop mid-patrol to have a full conversation with a\
  \ local stray or a scavenger bird perched on a ruined building. His lance teases him for it - until\
  \ a pack of giant canines doesn't attack them, or an avian swarm takes off suddenly, giving him\
  \ just enough warning before an ambush. Maybe Barry's just lucky. Or maybe the animals know\
  \ something the rest of them don't.
DOOLITTLE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't care much for the politics and ego battles of\
  \ military life. He's more comfortable talking to a DropShip's cat or a bunker rat than his\
  \ commanding officer. "Animals don't lie, and they don't stab you in the back for a bigger\
  \ payday," he says. "You could learn a thing or two from 'em."
DOOLITTLE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's seen too many comrades die. He's stopped trying to make\
  \ real connections with people - they never last. But animals? They don't ask questions. They don't\
  \ make promises they can't keep. And when Barry whispers to a half-starved dog before a\
  \ firefight, telling it to run and hide, it's not because he's worried about the mutt. It's\
  \ because, deep down, he knows it'll outlive him.
DOOLITTLE.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry talks to every animal that wanders into camp - whether it's a\
  \ lizard sunning itself on a crate or a cargo bay rat sneaking rations. He's the reason the\
  \ company somehow has a "mascot," even though nobody remembers adopting it.
DOOLITTLE.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry insists animals understand him. The company's techs were\
  \ skeptical - until he got a half-feral warehouse dog to stop stealing rations, or convinced a\
  \ colony of birds to roost outside the DropShip's exhaust ports instead of inside them. No one\
  \ knows how he does it, but it's saved them a lot of maintenance hours.
DOOLITTLE.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry has a habit of talking to stray animals like they're the\
  \ only ones who really understand him. He says things to them he'd never admit to another\
  \ human - his fears, his regrets, the things he's seen that still keep him up at night. "At least\
  \ you won't lie to me," he mutters to a one-eyed cat. It just stares at him, unblinking, as if it\
  \ knows.

DRAMATIC.label=Overly Dramatic
DRAMATIC.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry never just reloads - he flourishes like he's starring in a war\
  \ epic. He doesn't dive for cover, he hurls himself into it. Every fight is a set piece, every\
  \ victory a monologue waiting to happen. His squad rolls their eyes, but they have to admit - when\
  \ he pulls off a perfectly timed, slow-motion explosion escape, it's damn impressive.
DRAMATIC.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry describes battle like it's high art. "The PPC arcs like a\
  \ comet's tail, marking the end of an enemy's story," he mutters over comms. "The battlefield\
  \ sings with the percussion of autocannons and missile strikes." His lance just wants him to call\
  \ the damn targets, but he's too busy turning war into a performance.
DRAMATIC.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he plays a role. He wants his last stand\
  \ to be legendary, his name whispered in hushed tones long after he's gone. If he falls, it has\
  \ to be in a blaze of glory, outnumbered but never outmatched. The problem is... war doesn't care\
  \ about theatrics. And no one remembers the dead the way they think they will.
DRAMATIC.description.0.CIVILIAN="Ah, once again we are denied the spare fusion engines we so\
  \ desperately need! Shall we resign ourselves to ICEs, or dare we defy fate and improvise?" Barry\
  \ narrates every minor setback like it's a Shakespearean tragedy. Somehow, the sheer absurdity of\
  \ it makes the bureaucracy almost tolerable.
DRAMATIC.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry doesn't just deliver status reports - he performs them. He\
  \ gestures wildly, paces like a stage actor, and gasps in mock horror at every budget cut. The\
  \ higher-ups are exasperated, but his dramatic delivery actually keeps people awake during\
  \ meetings, so they tolerate him. Barely.
DRAMATIC.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry speaks in grand, sweeping terms because he knows the truth:\
  \ in war, most lives are forgotten, reduced to a footnote in someone else's report. He refuses to\
  \ let that happen. He remembers the dead, tells their stories, makes their sacrifices matter.\
  \ Even if no one listens. Even if, in the end, he'll be forgotten too.

EATING_HABITS.label=Unpredictable Eating Habits
EATING_HABITS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry will go an entire day without eating, only to inhale\
  \ three full MREs right before a drop. Sometimes, he forgets to eat at all, other times, he's\
  \ gnawing on a ration bar mid-firefight. His squad has stopped questioning it - except for the time\
  \ he casually sipped a protein shake while under heavy fire.
EATING_HABITS.description.1.COMBATANT=One day, Barry is choking down cold canned meat in a muddy\
  \ foxhole like everyone else. The next, he's somehow managed to sear a cut of unknown protein\
  \ over an engine vent and is sprinkling scavenged spices on it. "Eat well when you can," he says,\
  \ as if anyone else has time for battlefield fine dining.
EATING_HABITS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry either forgets to eat for days or devours everything in\
  \ sight, like he's afraid there won't be another meal. He doesn't talk about it, but those who\
  \ know him well suspect he's been through famine, blockade, or a siege. He never wastes food. He\
  \ never complains about rations. Because he remembers when there wasn't anything to eat at all.
EATING_HABITS.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry tracks every supply shipment, fuel order, and ration\
  \ count with precision - yet somehow, he always forgets to eat himself. It's not uncommon to find\
  \ him gnawing on a stale protein bar at 3 AM while recalculating fuel logistics, as if he just\
  \ remembered that human beings require sustenance.
EATING_HABITS.description.1.CIVILIAN=One day, Barry is eating gourmet-grade imported beef from a\
  \ high-end merchant. The next, he's happily spooning up a cold can of something labeled only as\
  \ "Meat Product." Nobody can predict what he'll eat next, and at this point, no one dares try.
EATING_HABITS.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry eats like someone who's seen real hunger. He never\
  \ throws food away, never turns down a meal, and has a habit of keeping emergency rations even\
  \ when food is plentiful. Sometimes, he chews slower, as if trying to make each bite last,\
  \ staring at his plate like he's seeing something the rest of them can't - like he's remembering.

ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.label=Extreme Environmental Sensitivity
ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.description.0.COMBATANT=Whether it's too hot, too cold, too humid, or too\
  \ dry, Barry will let you know. "I swear, this desert heat is melting me." "This jungle humidity\
  \ is literally trying to kill me." Yet, despite his endless gripes about the conditions, he's\
  \ still right there in the thick of it, fighting like hell. Complaining is just part of his\
  \ battlefield routine.
ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry is miserable in extreme conditions, but he\
  \ always finds ways to cope. On an ice world? He's hoarding heat packs in his boots. Stuck in a\
  \ dust storm? He's wearing a scarf like some kind of post-apocalyptic bandit. His ability to\
  \ adapt is almost as impressive as his ability to suffer loudly.
ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.description.2.COMBATANT=Every harsh wind feels like the bite of an old\
  \ wound. Every humid jungle reminds him of the infections he barely survived. Every freezing\
  \ night brings back the ghost of near-hypothermia. Barry's body has been through hell, and now it\
  \ feels every shift in the weather like a lingering punishment.
ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry has a personal grudge against the entire\
  \ Inner Sphere. "This world is too dusty." "This one has toxic rain." "This one? Too much\
  \ gravity." He's a professional, but the moment he steps outside a temperature-controlled\
  \ building, he's loudly questioning why anyone thought this planet was worth fighting for.
ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry has a personal stash of climate-control\
  \ gear that would make a survivalist jealous. Cooling vests, heated socks, humidifiers,\
  \ dehumidifiers - if there's a way to mitigate discomfort, he has it. He's always prepared, and if\
  \ you forgot to bring gloves to an ice world, you might be able to borrow some... for a price.
ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry's body isn't built for this life. Every\
  \ drop in temperature burns his nerves. Every breath of thin atmosphere makes his lungs scream.\
  \ Every exposure to a new planet's toxic pollen, biting cold, or acidic rain grinds him down.\
  \ The universe is harsh, and Barry feels every bit of it. One day, his body just won't adapt\
  \ anymore.

EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.label=Excessive Caution
EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry double-checks everything. His lance rolls their\
  \ eyes when he insists on inspecting his gear one more time before deployment, but his weapon\
  \ never jams. He never walks into an ambush, never gets caught off guard - and when he tells the\
  \ unit, "Something doesn't feel right," they've learned to listen.
EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry refuses to rush. Every movement in combat is\
  \ deliberate, every approach is scouted, and every plan has a contingency. His unit grumbles when\
  \ he insists on re-checking their escape route for the third time - but when the first two go bad,\
  \ they don't complain anymore.
EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry survives. He's survived everything. He never\
  \ charges in, never takes unnecessary risks, never makes the fatal mistakes his comrades do. But\
  \ survival comes at a cost - he's always the one left standing, always the one pulling bodies from\
  \ wreckage, always the one left to bury the dead. He wonders if, one day, caution won't be enough.
EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry plans for every possible scenario. Need backup\
  \ rations? Already stocked. Emergency medical supplies? Got 'em. Redundant power systems?\
  \ Installed last week. Some say he's paranoid - until the day things go wrong, and he's the only\
  \ reason they survive.
EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry refuses to sign off on anything until he's read\
  \ every contract clause, cross-checked the budget, and confirmed the supplier's reputation. It\
  \ makes things excruciatingly slow, but it also means the company never gets scammed, shorted, or\
  \ stuck with defective equipment.
EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry isn't just cautious - he's aware. He sees the cracks\
  \ forming before anyone else does. He knows when a company is running on borrowed time, when a\
  \ contract is one mistake away from turning into a death sentence. He doesn't panic, doesn't\
  \ shout - he just watches, silent and grim, waiting for the inevitable collapse.

EXCESSIVE_GREETING.label=Over-the-Top Greetings
EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.0.COMBATANT=Whether it's a battlefield check-in or a casual\
  \ encounter in the barracks, Barry never greets anyone normally. "Ah-ha! My favorite sniper,\
  \ still breathing, I see!" "BEHOLD, THE ACE MECHJOCK RETURNS FROM ANOTHER GLORIOUS VICTORY!" Even\
  \ in the middle of combat, he'll key his comm just to yell, "GOOD MORNING, YOU MAGNIFICENT\
  \ BASTARDS!" It's impossible to ignore him - and, admittedly, hard to feel unappreciated.
EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry treats every greeting like a full-scale reunion.\
  \ Even if he saw you five minutes ago, he'll wave both arms, slap you on the back, and shout your\
  \ name like you've been missing for years. It's ridiculous - but in a profession where people do\
  \ disappear forever, nobody minds hearing, "Well, look who's still alive! Damn good to see ya!"
EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry greets everyone like they're his long-lost best\
  \ friend, because deep down, he knows - they might be gone tomorrow. He's seen too many empty\
  \ bunks, too many callsigns go silent, too many comrades blown apart mid-sentence. So he greets\
  \ everyone like it's the last time he'll ever get the chance. Because someday, it will be.
EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.0.CIVILIAN=Walk into the depot, and you will be greeted. Loudly.\
  \ "Ah-HA! The HERO of the battlefield RETURNS to my humble domain! What grand treasures do you\
  \ seek today, O Mighty Warrior?" It's impossible to take him seriously - but it's also impossible\
  \ to leave in a bad mood.
EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry doesn't just greet people, he performs an\
  \ introduction. Whether it's an exaggerated bow, a dramatic handshake, or an entire impromptu \
  speech about your accomplishments, he somehow turns entering a room into an event. The commander\
  \ tried to make him stop - until even the most exhausted warriors admitted they kind of liked it.
EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.2.CIVILIAN=Sometimes, Barry slips up. He greets people who aren't\
  \ there anymore. "Jenkins! Damn good to see you!" Only to be met with silence, an empty bunk, or\
  \ a blank stare from someone who remembers Jenkins died last month. He laughs it off, pretends\
  \ it didn't happen. But deep down, he knows - one day, someone else is going to do the same thing\
  \ to his empty bunk.

EYE_CONTACT.label=Maintains Intense Eye Contact
EYE_CONTACT.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just look at people - he locks on like a targeting\
  \ system. Enemy lining up a shot? He stares them down through the HUD like he dares them to miss.\
  \ Comrade panicking under fire? He grips their shoulder and holds their gaze until they snap out\
  \ of it. His stare isn't just intense - it's commanding.
EYE_CONTACT.description.1.COMBATANT=Whether he's giving orders, lining up a shot, or listening to a\
  \ mission briefing, Barry does not blink. His lance jokes that he doesn't need targeting\
  \ computers - he just looks at a target long enough and the shot finds its mark. It'd be impressive\
  \ if it weren't so unsettling.
EYE_CONTACT.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's stare is hollow, deep, wrong. He looks through people,\
  \ past them, as if he's seeing something beyond the present moment. It's like he already knows\
  \ how this battle will end - how everyone's battle will end. And when he looks at you too long, you\
  \ start to wonder... does he see your fate, too?
EYE_CONTACT.description.0.CIVILIAN=Trying to get extra rations? Claiming you never got issued ammo?\
  \ Barry doesn't even need to check the manifest. He just stares at you, silent, waiting. Within\
  \ seconds, most people break down and confess. "Okay, fine, I did take an extra case of heat\
  \ sinks. Just stop looking at me like that."
EYE_CONTACT.description.1.CIVILIAN=A casual chat with Barry is anything but casual. He maintains\
  \ direct, unwavering eye contact the entire time, no matter how mundane the topic. Whether he's\
  \ talking about supply shipments or asking if you've eaten today, it always feels like he's\
  \ staring into your soul.
EYE_CONTACT.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry doesn't just look at people - he memorizes them. The shape\
  \ of their scars, the flicker of hesitation in their voice, the way they tense when discussing\
  \ past battles. It's not just observation; it's cataloging. Because Barry knows that in a\
  \ military unit, faces disappear. And someone has to remember them.

FASHION_CHOICES.label=Eccentric Fashion Choices
FASHION_CHOICES.description.0.COMBATANT=While the rest of the squad sticks to standard-issue gear,\
  \ Barry finds ways to stand out. Maybe it's a bright red scarf tied around his combat armor, a\
  \ custom-painted helmet with flair, or a ridiculous pair of aviator shades that he insists\
  \ improve his targeting. He fights just as hard as anyone else, but he'll damned if he does it\
  \ without style.
FASHION_CHOICES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry has one piece of gear he refuses to part with - an old\
  \ leather jacket, a neon-colored sash, or maybe a battered hula girl that somehow survived a\
  \ cockpit ejection. He claims it's lucky. His squad claims it's a liability. But after seeing him\
  \ walk away from three near-death situations, nobody tells him to take it off anymore.
FASHION_CHOICES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's patches don't match. His gear is a mix of different\
  \ uniforms, scavenged from fallen mercs, lost comrades, or abandoned battlefields. He says it's\
  \ "just practical." But every piece has a name behind it, a story he won't tell. And when he\
  \ gears up, he's not just wearing armor - he's carrying ghosts.
FASHION_CHOICES.description.0.CIVILIAN=Everyone else in the company wears standard fatigues. Barry?\
  \ Barry struts around the hangar in a velvet waistcoat, a brightly patterned scarf, or a jumpsuit\
  \ covered in custom patches from a dozen different mercenary outfits. He argues that if he has to\
  \ run support for a bunch of killers, he might as well look good doing it.
FASHION_CHOICES.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry's wardrobe is a mystery. One day, he's in a full\
  \ Hegemony officer's coat (with no explanation). The next, he's wearing knee-high boots and a\
  \ flamboyant sash like he's leading a parade. The only constant is that no one ever sees him wear\
  \ the same outfit twice. Where does he get this stuff? No one knows.
FASHION_CHOICES.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry's clothes don't fit the war-torn world he lives in.\
  \ His coats are pristine, his accessories impractical, his boots polished like he's about to\
  \ attend a grand ball instead of supporting a military unit. He dresses like he's from a world\
  \ that hasn't existed in centuries - as if, by refusing to acknowledge reality, he can pretend it\
  \ still does.

FIDGETS.label=Constantly Fidgeting
FIDGETS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry is always moving - tapping his fingers on his rifle, adjusting\
  \ his gloves, shifting his stance even when in cover. His lance used to think he was anxious, but\
  \ no - this is just how he operates. He says he fights better when he's in motion. And judging by\
  \ his reaction time, he might actually be right.
FIDGETS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's knee bounces when he's on a stakeout. His hands tap rhythms\
  \ when he's waiting to drop. His fingers drum against his sidearm before a fight. Some say it's\
  \ nerves, some say it's a bad habit - but whatever it is, it's impossible to ignore. His squad\
  \ isn't sure if it makes him more dangerous, or if one day, he's just going to snap.
FIDGETS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry fidgets because if he stops moving, his hands remember. They\
  \ remember the recoil of every shot, the weight of a dying friend, the texture of dried blood\
  \ under his nails. He plays with his gear, taps his fingers, shifts his stance - not because he's\
  \ impatient, but because stillness brings memories, and memories are worse than war.
FIDGETS.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry is always doing something, even when he doesn't need to be. If\
  \ he's talking to you, he's also reorganizing crates, flipping a pen between his fingers, or\
  \ double-checking inventory counts that don't actually need to be checked. He calls it "efficient\
  \ multitasking." Everyone else calls it "exhausting to watch."
FIDGETS.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry doesn't attend briefings so much as survive them. He taps on\
  \ tables, spins a data slate in his hands, or starts disassembling and reassembling whatever\
  \ piece of equipment is within reach. He swears it helps him focus, but more than once, a\
  \ commander has had to stop mid-sentence to tell him to put that back together.
FIDGETS.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry keeps his hands busy, always. If he's moving, if he's doing\
  \ something, then maybe he won't think about how many people he's seen walk to their death, how\
  \ many jobs he's approved that led to ruin, how many times he's signed off on death orders\
  \ disguised as payroll. His hands shake when they're empty, so he makes sure they never are.

FITNESS.label=Extreme Personal Fitness Routine
FITNESS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just stay in shape - he pushes himself beyond reason.\
  \ If the squad is running drills, he's doing extra laps. If they're training, he's doing push-ups\
  \ between maneuvers. He treats his body like a weapon, and he's determined to keep it sharpened\
  \ at all times.
FITNESS.description.1.COMBATANT=If Barry can do something in a harder, more exhausting way, he\
  \ will. He sprints to his Mech instead of walking, does pull-ups on a DropShip's cargo racks, and\
  \ somehow turns reloading a missile rack into a full-body workout. "Gotta stay combat-ready," he\
  \ says, between sets of one-arm push-ups.
FITNESS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry trains like a man trying to break himself. He pushes through\
  \ injuries, ignores exhaustion, and punishes his body like it owes him something. Maybe he's\
  \ trying to outlast the war, or maybe he's just waiting for the day his body finally gives\
  \ out - because he knows the battlefield won't do it cleanly.
FITNESS.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry may work support, but he's built like an elite commando. He\
  \ wakes up before the MechWarriors to train, runs extra PT drills, and somehow convinces\
  \ maintenance crews to do push-ups while waiting for system diagnostics. He insists it's just a\
  \ hobby, but when he casually deadlifts a supply crate meant for two people, no one's sure\
  \ anymore.
FITNESS.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry turns everything into exercise. Organizing inventory? He\
  \ carries two crates at once for the added resistance. Long-haul travel on a JumpShip? He's doing\
  \ bodyweight workouts in zero-G. If he's standing still, he's probably clenching his abs just to\
  \ make sure he's "maximizing muscle engagement."
FITNESS.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry trains like a man expecting the worst. Even though he runs\
  \ support, he preps like he'll be the last line of defense. His body is covered in\
  \ micro-injuries, stress fractures, and old bruises that never heal right. He says he just "likes\
  \ to stay in shape." But his eyes say he's afraid of what'll happen if he ever stops.

FIXATES.label=Fixates on One Topic
FIXATES.description.0.COMBATANT=Once Barry gets an idea in his head, nothing will get him to drop\
  \ it. If he's convinced a flanking maneuver is the best strategy, he'll argue about it until\
  \ deployment. If he thinks a certain Mech loadout is ideal, he'll lecture anyone who'll listen.\
  \ Sometimes it's annoying - but sometimes, he's right.
FIXATES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry has a special interest, and by God, you will hear about it.\
  \ Maybe it's the history of a specific battle, maybe it's the aerodynamics of autocannon rounds,\
  \ maybe it's the exact specifications of every BattleMech ever made. Whatever it is, once he\
  \ starts talking, there's no stopping him.
FIXATES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry latches onto a topic with desperation. He throws himself into\
  \ technical specs, tactics, anything that keeps his mind from wandering. He knows if he stops\
  \ thinking about this, he'll start thinking about everything else - the battles he's lost, the\
  \ friends who never made it back, the creeping realization that fighting never really ends.
FIXATES.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry has one passion: streamlining supply chains. He has charts. He\
  \ has diagrams. He's written essays about how they could shave seconds off deployment times. The\
  \ company's operations have never been smoother - but dear God, someone please get him to talk\
  \ about anything else.
FIXATES.description.1.CIVILIAN=No matter where a conversation starts, Barry will bring it back to\
  \ his chosen topic. "Oh, you're talking about planetary weather patterns? That reminds me of how\
  \ desert conditions affect Mech heat sinks!" No one knows how he does it. No one wants him to do\
  \ it.
FIXATES.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry fixates because if he doesn't, his mind starts wandering to\
  \ places it shouldn't. It's easier to focus on logistics, or Mech classifications, or the finer\
  \ points of battlefield tactics than to acknowledge what he's really doing - desperately clinging\
  \ to one thing in a universe that's constantly tearing everything else away.

FLASK.label=Carries a Flask
FLASK.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's flask isn't just for drinking - it's ritual. A sip before\
  \ battle for luck, a sip after for survival. He swears it keeps him steady, keeps the nerves from\
  \ creeping in. His lance jokes that he's pickling himself so he can live forever.
FLASK.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's flask is always full, and he's always willing to pass it\
  \ around. Before a mission, after a mission, in the middle of one if things are slow enough.\
  \ "Nothing wrong with a quick sip," he says, handing it over with a grin. No one's sure if it's\
  \ actual alcohol, battlefield coffee, or something worse - but whatever it is, it burns.
FLASK.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry drinks because if he doesn't, the memories come crawling back.\
  \ The faces of the dead, the screams over comms, the way burning metal smells just like burning\
  \ flesh. He's not drinking to get drunk - he's drinking to function. The flask is always with him.\
  \ It has to be. Because the moment it's empty, the past comes rushing in.
FLASK.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry's flask isn't just for himself - it's for everyone. He's got a\
  \ special reserve for MechWarriors after a hard fight, a backup stash for celebrating a rare win,\
  \ and a hidden emergency bottle for when things really go to hell. His philosophy? A military\
  \ unit runs on money, ammo, and just enough booze to keep people sane.
FLASK.description.1.CIVILIAN="It's just for the nerves," Barry says, casually taking a sip while\
  \ filing requests. "Good for circulation." He's got an excuse for every situation - cold weather,\
  \ bad food, long meetings. If he ever actually ran out, the entire admin staff would probably\
  \ collapse from shock.
FLASK.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry doesn't drink for fun. He drinks because he made choices - signed\
  \ orders that got people killed, approved supply runs that never made it back, trusted the wrong\
  \ people. The flask is his way of forgetting, if only for a moment. But no matter how much he\
  \ drinks, the ledger never balances.

FOOT_TAPPER.label=Always Tapping Foot
FOOT_TAPPER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's foot is always tapping - against the floor of the\
  \ DropShip, against the dirt in a trench, against the side of an ammo crate during a briefing.\
  \ It's like he's waiting for something to happen, like he's just a half-second away from bolting\
  \ into action. His squad has learned that when Barry's foot stops tapping, that's when things are\
  \ about to get serious.
FOOT_TAPPER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't sit still. His foot taps because his whole body\
  \ wants to move. He's the first one geared up, the first one out the DropShip, and the first one\
  \ pushing the pace in an assault. When he's forced to wait, he gets jittery, practically\
  \ vibrating with impatience. "Hurry up and get to the shooting part," he mutters, tapping away.
FOOT_TAPPER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's foot taps to a rhythm that no one else can hear. Maybe\
  \ it's an old war march, maybe it's the echoes of battles past, or maybe it's just his way of\
  \ staying present. He doesn't talk about it, but some nights, when everything is quiet, he's\
  \ still tapping. Like he's counting down to something only he knows is coming.
FOOT_TAPPER.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry's foot taps as he calculates supply orders, budget\
  \ projections, and shipment schedules in real-time. It's like his brain is moving too fast for\
  \ his body to keep up. The tapping isn't impatience - it's momentum. He's already thinking about\
  \ the next problem before anyone else even realizes there is one.
FOOT_TAPPER.description.1.CIVILIAN=The tapping never stops. Boardroom table? Tap tap tap. Cargo bay\
  \ inspection? Tap tap tap. Even when he's standing still, the sound of his boot against the deck\
  \ is constant. No one knows if he's nervous, bored, or just wired differently - but after a while,\
  \ people start tapping along without realizing it.
FOOT_TAPPER.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry taps his foot to remind himself he's alive. That he's\
  \ still moving, still breathing, still part of this world. Some nights, after too many bad\
  \ missions, he has to force his foot to tap - because if it stops, even for a second, he's afraid\
  \ he won't be able to start it again.

FORGETFUL.label=Chronically Forgetful
FORGETFUL.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry is a solid fighter, but damn if he doesn't always forget\
  \ something before a mission. Harness? Left it in the barracks. Comms check? Oops. Forgot to eat\
  \ before deployment? Absolutely. His squad has learned to double-check his gear along with their\
  \ own because, sooner or later, Barry is going to pat himself down and go, "Wait... where's my\
  \ sidearm?"
FORGETFUL.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry remembers battle tactics, enemy weak points, and how to\
  \ compensate for environmental conditions perfectly. But ask him what day it is? Who they're\
  \ fighting this week? Whether or not he ate before a mission? Gone. His mind is laser-focused on\
  \ combat, but the second they get back to base, he's back to asking, "Wait, what planet is this\
  \ again?"
FORGETFUL.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't forget because he's careless. He forgets because\
  \ his head is already full - full of old battlefields, old mistakes, old names. There's only so\
  \ much room in a person's memory, and Barry made a choice long ago: he'll never forget the\
  \ fallen, even if it means losing everything else.
FORGETFUL.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry is great at managing supplies. He remembers critical\
  \ shipment schedules, high-priority requests, and budget restrictions flawlessly. But somehow, he\
  \ always forgets one thing - sometimes minor, sometimes catastrophic. "Oh, we were supposed to\
  \ order coolant last cycle? Uh... whoops."
FORGETFUL.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry forgets names, times, and occasionally his own job title,\
  \ but somehow, the company still runs. He keeps the entire operation afloat through sheer\
  \ instinct, despite being the guy who asks, "Wait, did I eat today?" while running inventory\
  \ checks.
FORGETFUL.description.2.CIVILIAN=At first, Barry just forgot little things - dates, meetings, faces.\
  \ Then it got worse. Entire conversations lost. Mission details slipping. A comrade's name, right\
  \ on the tip of his tongue, but... gone. He laughs it off, pretends it's nothing, but deep down, he\
  \ knows: one day, he's going to forget something that really matters. Maybe he already has.

FORMAL_SPEECH.label=Overly Formal Speech
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry delivers battlefield reports like he's speaking in a\
  \ royal court. "Sir, I must inform you that our current tactical position is most untenable." His\
  \ lance has given up trying to get him to talk like a normal human being, and at this point, they\
  \ just roll with it.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry insists on addressing even his closest comrades as\
  \ "Lieutenant," "Sergeant," or "esteemed colleague." No one knows if it's a quirk, a joke, or if\
  \ he actually thinks they're all attending a formal gala instead of wading through battlefield\
  \ wreckage. Either way, it makes war sound bizarrely polite.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry speaks like a man out of time, using words and phrases\
  \ that no one else does anymore. Maybe it's because he came from somewhere refined. Maybe it's a\
  \ desperate attempt to hold on to a piece of himself before war grinds him into dust like\
  \ everyone else. Or maybe... he knows that once he stops speaking this way, there'll be nothing\
  \ left of the person he used to be.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry's supply reports don't just list numbers - they tell a\
  \ story. "It is with deep regret that I must inform you that our reserve ammunition stocks have\
  \ dwindled to perilous levels, necessitating swift resupply lest we court catastrophe." The\
  \ commander sighs, but at least someone in the unit is keeping things interesting.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry doesn't just give briefings. He delivers them with the\
  \ gravitas of a statesman addressing a planetary congress. "Honored comrades, we find ourselves\
  \ at a most critical juncture in our fiscal projections." Everyone wishes he'd just say they're\
  \ running low on cash, but at least it makes budget meetings marginally less soul-crushing.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry speaks with eloquence and grace because someone has to.\
  \ The universe is brutal, war is endless, and civility is dying. If he starts talking like the\
  \ rest of them - cold, clipped, brutal - then what's left? Just another gun for hire, another cog in\
  \ the war machine. He refuses. Even if it makes him sound ridiculous, he refuses.

FURNITURE.label=Constantly Rearranges Furniture
FURNITURE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry treats every space like a battlefield map. Barracks layout?\
  \ He adjusts the bunks for "optimal emergency evacuation routes." DropShip lounge? The chairs\
  \ need to be "fortified positions in case of boarding actions." His squad rolls their eyes when\
  \ they find their lockers moved again - but deep down, they know he's probably not wrong.
FURNITURE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry never leaves a room the way he found it. He'll shift crates\
  \ in the hangar, move chairs around briefing rooms, and completely rearrange the break area just\
  \ because it didn't feel right. No one knows why he does it, but at this point, the unit just\
  \ waits for The Barry Edition of any given room before getting comfortable.
FURNITURE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry moves furniture not for comfort, but for survival. Every\
  \ table, every chair, every bunk - every piece has to be in the right place. Barricades, fallback\
  \ positions, places to hide. He learned the hard way that when an ambush comes, your surroundings\
  \ matter. If his lance thinks he's obsessive, that's fine - one day, it might save their lives.
FURNITURE.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry is incapable of leaving a room alone. The storage crates?\
  \ Better flow if they're stacked this way. The command center? Desks should be closer for\
  \ efficiency. The mess hall? Obviously, tables need to be rotated 45 degrees for maximum comfort.\
  \ The crew walks in every morning never knowing what new layout Barry has cooked up.
FURNITURE.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry can't stop tweaking the company's base layout. "This would\
  \ be way more functional if the tool racks were over there." "Why is the coffee machine so far\
  \ from the main entry?" It doesn't matter if it's a barracks, a mobile command center, or a\
  \ DropShip cargo hold - Barry will optimize it, even if it means driving everyone insane.
FURNITURE.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry moves furniture, gear, everything - not because it matters,\
  \ but because it's something he can change. He can't control which contracts they take, who lives\
  \ or dies, or when the next battle will come. But he can control where the damn chairs go. And\
  \ some days, that's the only thing keeping him from losing his mind.

GLASSES.label=Constantly Adjusts Glasses
GLASSES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just push up his glasses - he does it while scanning\
  \ enemy formations, calculating range corrections, or muttering about heat efficiency. His squad\
  \ has learned that when he adjusts them twice in a row, he's about to say something really\
  \ important. If he takes them off, it's already too late.
GLASSES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry looks like he should be in a research lab, not a battlefield.\
  \ His glasses are always slipping down his nose, his HUD is constantly recalibrating for glare,\
  \ and he's the only one who checks a damage report before checking his own injuries. And yet,\
  \ somehow, he never misses a shot.
GLASSES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry pushes up his glasses like it'll make the world clearer, like\
  \ it'll help him understand why he's still alive when so many aren't. He sees every mistake,\
  \ every miscalculation, every doomed maneuver before it happens - but no one ever listens in time.\
  \ He keeps adjusting his glasses, keeps trying to see better - but it doesn't change a damn thing.
GLASSES.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry's glasses are always slipping because he's always\
  \ reading - contract clauses, supply manifests, tech manuals in languages he doesn't actually\
  \ speak. If there's a scam in a deal, he'll find it. If there's a loophole in a contract, he'll\
  \ close it. His glasses may be old, scratched, and constantly need an adjustment, but they\
  \ never miss a detail.
GLASSES.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry adjusts his glasses so often that people have started using it\
  \ as a warning sign. If he's doing it absentmindedly while scribbling notes, he's solving a\
  \ problem. If he does it sharply while reading, he's just found something terrible. If he\
  \ adjusts them three times in a row? Someone messed up big time.
GLASSES.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry adjusts his glasses as he scans death tolls, burned-out\
  \ accounts, the slow collapse of everything. He keeps records, because someone has to. He keeps\
  \ reading, because ignorance won't save them. He keeps adjusting his glasses, because the numbers\
  \ never get any better.

GLOVES.label=Always Wearing Gloves
GLOVES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry insists that good grip is everything. Whether he's scoffing\
  \ down an MRE, cleaning his sidearm, or attending a mandatory training meeting, his gloves are\
  \ always on. He claims they improve performance, reduce wear on his hands, and help keep sweat\
  \ from ruining his trigger control. His squad thinks he's being excessive - until their own hands\
  \ are blistered and bruised while his are perfectly fine.
GLOVES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry is always wearing gloves, no exceptions. No one has ever seen\
  \ him take them off - not to eat, not to fix his gear, not even to shake hands. Some assume it's\
  \ habit, others think it's superstition. The truth? Barry won't say, and no one has the nerve to\
  \ ask.
GLOVES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's gloves aren't just habit - they're armor. Beneath them, his\
  \ hands tell stories no one else is allowed to read - burns from an engine explosion, deep scars\
  \ from a knife fight, skin that's never fully healed from exposure to toxic rain. He covers them\
  \ up because if he doesn't, he'll have to explain. And he doesn't want to remember.
GLOVES.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry handles supply crates, repair tools, and even paperwork with\
  \ gloved hands. "You do not want to know how dirty these surfaces are," he insists while\
  \ disinfecting a shipment manifest. The tech crews roll their eyes, but when they see what\
  \ actually grows inside a poorly maintained coolant line, they start wondering if he's got a\
  \ point.
GLOVES.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry cycles through different gloves for different jobs. No matter\
  \ the occasion, he always has the right pair ready. At this point, it's just part of who he is.
GLOVES.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry wears gloves because he remembers. The first time he felt warm\
  \ blood seep through his fingers, the first time he held a dying friend's hand, the first time he\
  \ had to scrub his own hands raw to get rid of a stain that never really went away. He wears\
  \ gloves now, not to protect himself, but to pretend that some things never happened.

HAND_GESTURES.label=Excessive Hand Gestures
HAND_GESTURES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just call out targets - he illustrates them with\
  \ wild gestures. He points, waves, and practically mimes his battle strategies. His lance jokes\
  \ that if his radio ever goes down, he could probably still direct an entire skirmish just with\
  \ hand signals and exaggerated shrugs.
HAND_GESTURES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry can't give a briefing, tell a story, or even trash-talk\
  \ an enemy without animated, sweeping gestures. He's nearly smacked his own teammates more than\
  \ once while explaining a maneuver mid-battle. He fights just as expressively - every reload, every\
  \ charge, every headshot somehow feels like it belongs in an action holo.
HAND_GESTURES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's hands never stop moving - because if they do, he might\
  \ remember. Remember the times he couldn't signal for help, when orders were lost in the chaos,\
  \ when a simple gesture could've saved someone but didn't come in time. He talks with his hands\
  \ because the alternative is letting them be still - and stillness brings nothing but ghosts.
HAND_GESTURES.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry doesn't just explain supply chain issues - he acts them\
  \ out. A shipment delay? He throws his hands skyward in exasperation. Budget cuts? He pantomimes\
  \ a knife slitting a throat. The crew half-listens to his actual words, but they always get the\
  \ message thanks to his theatrics.
HAND_GESTURES.description.1.CIVILIAN="Go left - no, left-left - okay, look, just follow my hand."\
  \ Barry's gesturing is so wild and exaggerated that sometimes people understand him less, not\
  \ more. His coworkers have learned to watch the gestures first and listen second.
HAND_GESTURES.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry's hands move constantly, tracing out stories, shaping\
  \ invisible diagrams, gesturing through explanations. But there's something in the way he\
  \ hesitates, like he's trying to use them for something else, something other than what they\
  \ were made for - pulling triggers, closing airlocks, writing names on casualty reports. The\
  \ motions keep the past at bay. Barely.

HAND_WRINGER.label=Compulsive Hand-Wringer
HAND_WRINGER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry wrings his hands while waiting for battle to start,\
  \ during mission briefings, even mid-firefight. He sees every possible way things could go wrong\
  \ and can't help but fret over them. His lance jokes that if he ever stops rubbing his hands\
  \ together, that's when they should start panicking.
HAND_WRINGER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry double-checks his weapons, reviews the mission plan\
  \ again, and adjusts his gear obsessively - but no matter how prepared he is, his hands keep\
  \ twisting together, like he's waiting for some unseen disaster. The second the bullets start\
  \ flying, though, the hand-wringing stops - because once the battle begins, there's no time left to\
  \ worry.
HAND_WRINGER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry wrings his hands because they remember. They remember\
  \ every mission gone wrong, every time he hesitated, every comrade he couldn't save. His fingers\
  \ trace scars, phantom pains from injuries long healed, from choices that never will. The war\
  \ might not have killed him yet, but it's taken pieces of him - one nervous motion at a time.
HAND_WRINGER.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry isn't just responsible for his team - he's responsible for\
  \ people. Every time he hands out rations, ammo, or medical kits, his hands twist together like\
  \ he's wondering if it's enough. He knows the numbers, but knowing doesn't make it easier when he\
  \ has to tell someone there's nothing left to give.
HAND_WRINGER.description.1.CIVILIAN=It doesn't matter if it's a million-C-bill contract or a coffee\
  \ order, Barry agonizes over every decision. His hands wring as he debates between fuel\
  \ allocations, payment schedules, or whether he should requisition one more crate of emergency\
  \ rations. "What if we need it later?" is his constant refrain, and no amount of reassurance\
  \ stops the fidgeting.
HAND_WRINGER.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry wrings his hands not just in nervousness, but in guilt.\
  \ He's the one who signs the orders. The one who makes the calculations - who lives, who fights,\
  \ who doesn't come back. The numbers say he's making the right calls, but his hands still shake\
  \ every time he stamps approval on a contract that sends people to their deaths.

HANDSHAKE.label=Overly Enthusiastic Handshake
HANDSHAKE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just shake hands - he grips with both hands, shakes\
  \ firmly, and holds on just a little too long. "Good to meet you, friend! We're going to do great\
  \ things together!" His enthusiasm is infectious, but some recruits worry they've just signed an\
  \ unspoken blood pact with him.
HANDSHAKE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry seals deals, alliances, and battle plans with a handshake\
  \ that could crush a lesser man's fingers. "Damn good to have you on board!" he booms, nearly\
  \ dislocating the arm of a junior officer. It's less a greeting and more an event, and somehow,\
  \ it actually makes people believe in him.
HANDSHAKE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry grips hands like he's afraid to let go, like he's holding\
  \ onto something real in a universe where people vanish in an instant. His squad has seen it\
  \ before - he shakes hands like it might be the last time. And too often, it is.
HANDSHAKE.description.0.CIVILIAN="Welcome to the chaos!" Barry grins as he shakes a MechWarriors's\
  \ hand so hard their whole torso moves. "Need anything? Ammo, armor, a replacement heat sink? You\
  \ just say the word!" No one can ever claim Barry lacks customer service skills... if they can\
  \ still feel their fingers afterward.
HANDSHAKE.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry's handshake is a statement, even when it really shouldn't\
  \ be. Meeting a high-ranking officer? He pumps their hand like they're old drinking buddies.\
  \ Signing a delicate negotiation? He shakes so hard it nearly knocks over the paperwork. Everyone\
  \ remembers meeting Barry - if only because their wrist hurts afterward.
HANDSHAKE.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry's handshakes are too firm, too eager, too desperate. Like\
  \ he's making sure you know you exist, that you're real, that you're still here. Because the\
  \ last time he let someone go without a proper handshake, they walked into a battle they didn't\
  \ walk out of. And he's been making up for it ever since.

HEADPHONES.label=Always Wearing Headphones
HEADPHONES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just go into battle - he does it with a playlist.\
  \ Whether it's heavy metal, modern symphonies, or classical rock, he swears the right song\
  \ keeps him in the zone. His squad is used to seeing him nodding along mid-firefight, completely\
  \ unfazed by the chaos around him.
HEADPHONES.description.1.COMBATANT=Whether he's about to drop, in the repair bay, or riding in a\
  \ DropShip, Barry always has his headphones on. Always. No one knows what he's listening to, but\
  \ they're pretty sure he's ignoring everything else - until it's time to fight. Then, suddenly,\
  \ he's hyper-focused, like the world just synced to his personal rhythm.
HEADPHONES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't listen to music because he enjoys it. He listens\
  \ because if he doesn't, the silence creeps in - the echoes of artillery, the screams over comms,\
  \ the last words of people who didn't make it. The headphones aren't just habit. They're\
  \ survival.
HEADPHONES.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry works like he's conducting an orchestra. No one knows\
  \ exactly what he's listening to, but if his head starts bobbing, it means things are getting\
  \\ done.
HEADPHONES.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry's headphones are a barrier. People argue? He doesn't hear\
  \ it. Commanders complain about budgets? Not his problem. Someone waves frantically for his\
  \ attention? He sighs, reluctantly pulls off one earpiece, and mutters, "This better be\
  \ important."
HEADPHONES.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry keeps his headphones on because music is the only thing\
  \ that still feels safe. He's seen planets burn, heard the real sounds of war. If he keeps the\
  \ music playing, maybe - just maybe - he can pretend, for a little while, that the universe isn't\
  \ completely falling apart.

HEALTHY_SNACKS.label=Frequently Snacking on Healthy Foods
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry treats combat like a sport, and fueling his body is part\
  \ of his routine. He's always chewing on protein bars, popping dried fruit between drills, and\
  \ downing electrolyte drinks like they're going out of style. His squad teases him, but they\
  \ don't complain when he hands out energy-packed snacks that keep them going during long\
  \ deployments.
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry believes in balance. One moment he's unloading an\
  \ autocannon into an enemy vehicle, the next he's peeling an orange and offering vitamin-packed\
  \ snacks to the team. "Hydration's key to peak combat performance," he says, handing a bottle of\
  \ electrolyte water to a comrade who's still shaking from adrenaline.
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't eat healthy because he's a fitness nut - he does it\
  \ because he knows what it's like to have nothing. To go days without food, to feel his body\
  \ weaken, to fight while running on empty. He stocks up, he preps, he controls his intake - because\
  \ the day will come when the food runs out again. And this time, he'll be ready.
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry believes a well-fed crew is a functional crew. He stocks\
  \ supply depots with the best ration options, pushes fresh produce when he can get it, and\
  \ constantly reminds people to eat real meals. If you need a snack, he's already got one on\
  \ hand - just don't ask for junk food.
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry is that guy - the one replacing coffee with herbal tea,\
  \ swapping ration packs for high-protein alternatives, and lecturing the unit about eating real\
  \ food instead of surviving on caffeine and spite. It's well-meaning... but after the third speech\
  \ about micronutrients, people start hiding their snacks from him.
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry stockpiles food, not out of paranoia, but because he\
  \ remembers. The hunger, the desperation, the slow, creeping weakness of not having enough. Even\
  \ in times of plenty, he stashes protein bars, dried fruit, anything that will last - because he\
  \ knows the moment will come when the company is cut off, and when it does, he won't be the one\
  \ caught starving again.

HISTORIAN.label=Passionate about History
HISTORIAN.description.0.COMBATANT=Every skirmish, every engagement, every ambush reminds him of a\
  \ past war. "This is just like the Hesperus II siege, different scale, same mistakes," he\
  \ mutters, adjusting his sights. His lance has learned that whenever he starts recounting\
  \ military history mid-firefight, it's either a sign of his confidence - or a really bad omen.
HISTORIAN.description.1.COMBATANT=Tactical formations, famous last stands, the lineage of a\
  \ particular mercenary unit - he can recall all of it. One moment he's breaking down the enemy's\
  \ battle doctrine, the next he's casually mentioning that their insignia has roots in some\
  \ obscure rebellion from 2434. Most of his comrades don't mind - unless they're trying to focus on\
  \ not dying.
HISTORIAN.description.2.COMBATANT=Wars don't change, only the names and weapons do. Barry has\
  \ studied enough conflicts to know how units rise and fall, how every so-called unstoppable force\
  \ eventually collapses. His knowledge isn't inspiring - it's a weight. He fights anyway, not\
  \ because he thinks this time will be different, but because he's got no other choice.
HISTORIAN.description.0.CIVILIAN=A simple request for replacement heat sinks can turn into a\
  \ twenty-minute lesson on old Terran engineering. Reviewing supply routes? Expect a tangent about\
  \ the logistical failures of the Rim War. Most of the company just nods along, secretly hoping\
  \ they'll retain at least one useful piece of trivia.
HISTORIAN.description.1.CIVILIAN=Somewhere in his personal storage are old reports, battlefield\
  \ maps, declassified documents, and a collection of holobooks that would make a historian\
  \ jealous. If a mercenary unit ever existed, he probably knows about it. If a planet ever hosted\
  \ a battle, he has the details. The trick isn't finding information - it's escaping before he tells\
  \ the entire backstory.
HISTORIAN.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry doesn't just study the famous battles - he memorizes the\
  \ names of those no one remembers. The soldiers whose units were wiped out, the mercenary\
  \ companies that vanished, the colonies erased by war and never rebuilt. He collects their\
  \ stories because no one else will. Because one day, someone will have to do the same for him.

HUMMER.label=Habitual Hummer
HUMMER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry is always humming - sometimes a marching cadence, sometimes\
  \ an old bar song, sometimes a melody no one else recognizes. It's not loud, just a quiet hum\
  \ over comms while he lines up a shot or waits for the next engagement. His lance jokes that if\
  \ he ever stops humming, that's when things have really gone bad.
HUMMER.description.1.COMBATANT=In the middle of a firefight, with missiles flying and alarms\
  \ blaring, Barry is still humming. He does it when charging, when bracing for impact, even while\
  \ dodging incoming fire. Some say it helps him focus. Others think he's just a little too\
  \ comfortable in the chaos. Either way, the tune never stops - until the shooting does.
HUMMER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry hums to fill the silence where voices used to be. The\
  \ comrades who didn't make it back, the allies lost on distant battlefields, the old commanders\
  \ who once barked orders over the radio. If he hums loud enough, maybe he won't have to hear\
  \ their ghosts whispering back.
HUMMER.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry hums as he takes inventory, hums while filling out\
  \ manifests, hums while rerouting cargo through bureaucratic nightmares. The tech crew has long\
  \ since accepted that the low hum of an old war tune or a jaunty little ditty means Barry is\
  \ nearby - usually with a clipboard and a sarcastic comment.
HUMMER.description.1.CIVILIAN=No matter where he is, Barry is always humming something. It's\
  \ never the same tune twice, and it's always just loud enough to be noticed. Whether he's\
  \ reviewing documents or walking through the barracks, his ever-present melody has become as much\
  \ a part of the company as the sound of Mech repairs in the hangar.
HUMMER.description.2.CIVILIAN=The company has lost a lot - good pilots, steady contracts, entire\
  \ DropShips full of people who never made it back. Barry hums because silence is worse. Silence\
  \ means another mission failure. Silence means another name wiped off the roster. Silence means\
  \ they're next. If he keeps humming, keeps making some kind of noise, maybe they're not done yet.

HYGIENIC.label=Obsessed with Hygiene
HYGIENIC.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry keeps his gear spotless, his weapons polished, and his\
  \ bunk smelling shockingly fresh. No matter how bad the battlefield gets, he finds time to wipe\
  \ down his visor and disinfect his gloves. His lance laughs, but when their weapons jam from dust\
  \ buildup and his fires clean, they start to reconsider.
HYGIENIC.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry refuses to drink from shared canteens, avoids touching\
  \ anything that hasn't been sanitized, and definitely has a stash of antiseptic wipes in every\
  \ pocket. "You think the enemy is the real threat?" he scoffs. "Try an untreated infection in the\
  \ middle of a contract." They joke that he's over the top - until half the squad goes down with\
  \ trench fever, and Barry's the only one still standing.
HYGIENIC.description.2.COMBATANT=No amount of scrubbing can wash the blood from his hands. Barry\
  \ showers until his skin is raw, sterilizes his gear twice before every battle, and wipes down\
  \ every surface he touches. He tells himself it's just habit, but deep down, he knows - no matter\
  \ how hard he tries, some stains never come out.
HYGIENIC.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry keeps his workspace pristine. Every surface is dusted,\
  \ every tool is disinfected, and no one touches the inventory without wearing gloves. "Clean\
  \ workspace, clean workflow," he mutters, wiping down a perfectly spotless terminal. The techs\
  \ roll their eyes, but deep down, they appreciate not having to work in filth.
HYGIENIC.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry has a very firm stance on personal cleanliness. Boots off\
  \ before entering the barracks, no eating near the control consoles, and absolutely no sneezing\
  \ without covering your mouth. If he had it his way, every MechWarrior would get decontaminated\
  \ before stepping into a cockpit. The commander refuses to humor him - but Barry still sprays down\
  \ every chair with disinfectant when no one's looking.
HYGIENIC.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry can't stop the war. He can't stop the deaths, the\
  \ betrayals, the slow rot of another unit heading toward ruin. But he can keep his workspace\
  \ clean. He can scrub the blood from the floors. He can make sure that, if nothing else, his\
  \ hands don't feel dirty - even when the rest of him does.

IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.label=Unusual Sleep Patterns
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't follow a normal sleep cycle - he sleeps when the\
  \ war lets him. A 15-minute nap in a cockpit? Good enough. Two hours slumped against a crate\
  \ between missions? That'll do. His squad wonders how he functions, but when the fighting starts,\
  \ he's always ready, no matter when he last closed his eyes.
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust sleep, not completely. He's the one pacing\
  \ the perimeter at odd hours, tinkering with his gear at 0300, sipping coffee while watching the\
  \ horizon. "Somebody's gotta keep an eye on things," he says, adjusting his harness. The truth?\
  \ He sleeps best when he knows someone else is standing watch - but he never quite trusts anyone\
  \ enough to let himself drift off.
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't sleep like normal people because his body\
  \ remembers too much. Every time he closes his eyes, his mind replays firefights he barely\
  \ survived, comrades he couldn't save, the slow-motion collapse of a battle gone wrong. He stays\
  \ awake as long as possible, dreading the moment exhaustion forces him to relive it all.
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry sleeps in shifts that make no sense to anyone else - two\
  \ hours here, a nap there, then somehow a full eight hours in the middle of a work cycle. No one\
  \ knows how he keeps things running on such an erratic schedule, but somehow, the work is still\
  \ finished on time.
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry treats sleep like an inconvenience. There's always another\
  \ report to file, another order to review, another detail to double-check. "I'll sleep when\
  \ things slow down," he says - but things never slow down. His coworkers have started making bets\
  \ on when he'll finally pass out at his desk.
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.2.CIVILIAN=Sleep isn't rest - it's vulnerability. It's time lost, moments he\
  \ can't control, a gap in awareness where something can go wrong. Barry puts it off, fights it,\
  \ drinks stimulant-laced tea just to keep going a little longer. He tells himself it's about\
  \ efficiency, but deep down, he knows - when he finally crashes, he might not want to wake up\
  \ again.

JOKER.label=Fond of Puns
JOKER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry cracks puns even in the heat of battle. "Looks like that\
  \ guy's having a meltdown," he quips after overheating an enemy Mech. His squad groans at his\
  \ constant wordplay, but they can't deny it lightens the tension - just enough to keep them steady\
  \ when the situation turns grim.
JOKER.description.1.COMBATANT=Whether it's a firefight, a stealth op, or a tense briefing,\
  \ Barry finds time for a pun. "Guess you could say we really blasted through that ambush," he\
  \ says with a grin, wiping soot off his armor. His squad has stopped trying to stop him - it's\
  \ better to let him get it out of his system and keep moving.
JOKER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's puns aren't just for fun - they're armor. Every terrible\
  \ joke, every groan-worthy pun is a way to push back against the constant dread of war. "We may\
  \ be fighting uphill, but at least we've got a peak advantage," he says with a wink. But behind\
  \ the grin, there's a weariness he'll never put into words.
JOKER.description.0.CIVILIAN=Whatever Barry is doing, there's always a pun involved. His\
  \ colleagues roll their eyes, but even the most jaded warrior cracks a smile now and then.
JOKER.description.1.CIVILIAN=The war never stops, the work never ends, but Barry finds a way\
  \ to make it just a little less awful. He sticks pun-laden sticky notes on schedules, makes\
  \ groan-worthy jokes during routine maintenance, and ensures no report leaves his desk without at\
  \ least one bad pun. No one likes it - but no one really wants him to stop, either.
JOKER.description.2.CIVILIAN=Every pun is forced, every joke just a little too loud. Barry\
  \ keeps the wordplay coming because if he stops, he'll have to face the reality of what he's\
  \ dealing with - the broken machines, the wounded soldiers, the paperwork documenting another\
  \ casualty instead of another paycheck. "Looks like someone's having a rough day," he says,\
  \ filling out another death report. The laugh that follows is just a little too hollow.

LISTS.label=Compulsive List Maker
LISTS.description.0.COMBATANT=Before every mission, Barry has a list - objectives, fallback\
  \ positions, enemy strengths, even a checklist of which comrades owe him money from last week's\
  \ poker game. He swears by his method, and given how rarely he's caught off guard, his team is\
  \ starting to believe he's onto something.
LISTS.description.1.COMBATANT=Every battle, every skirmish, every firefight has a plan. Barry\
  \ keeps a running list in his HUD - priority targets, terrain advantages, escape routes. "War is\
  \ just a series of problems to solve," he says, adding a mental checkmark as he takes down\
  \ another enemy.
LISTS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry knows war is a mess - he's seen friends die, missions\
  \ collapse, and too many unpredictable variables. So he makes lists. Lists of enemies confirmed\
  \ dead. Lists of the wounded. Lists of names he never wants to forget. It doesn't stop the chaos,\
  \ but at least on paper, it looks like something is under control.
LISTS.description.0.CIVILIAN=It doesn't matter what he's doing - Barry has a list for it. Daily\
  \ tasks? Listed. Emergency protocols? Color-coded and categorized. Someone asks him about\
  \ inventory? He flips through his secondary list to cross-reference the real list. No one knows\
  \ how he keeps track of so much, but without him, the whole operation would grind to a halt.
LISTS.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry doesn't trust memory - he trusts lists. Schedules, ration\
  \ allocations, critical injuries - if it matters, it's on a datapad or scribbled onto a notepad he\
  \ refuses to lose. "If it's not written down, it didn't happen," he says, making another\
  \ annotation that absolutely didn't need to be recorded but will come in handy later.
LISTS.description.2.CIVILIAN=The lists are getting longer. More damaged equipment, more\
  \ unpaid wages, more missing personnel. Barry doesn't just track resources - he tracks the decline.\
  \ Every name marked "deceased," every supply line lost, every payment delayed. He doesn't talk\
  \ about it, but in the quiet hours, he flips through his notes, wondering when he'll have to add\
  \ himself to the final list.

LITERAL.label=Overly Literal
LITERAL.description.0.COMBATANT="Cover me!" Barry's lance shouts, diving for cover. Barry,\
  \ standing still, replies, "Cover you with what? Suppressive fire? Smoke? A tarp?" While his unit\
  \ groans, he's already assessing precisely what they need - because in battle, clarity matters.
LITERAL.description.1.COMBATANT="Take out that tank!" Barry pauses. "Do you mean destroy the\
  \ tank, or just disable it? Are we capturing it? Are we worried about collateral damage?" By the\
  \ time he gets his answers, the squad has already moved - but at least he never misinterprets a\
  \ command.
LITERAL.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't use euphemisms. He doesn't talk about\
  \ "eliminating hostiles" or "neutralizing threats." He calls it what it is - killing. He's seen too\
  \ many people hide behind vague language, pretending it makes war cleaner. He refuses. War isn't\
  \ clean. And he won't pretend otherwise
LITERAL.description.0.CIVILIAN="Barry, patch up that report." He grabs a literal patch kit.\
  \ "Barry, hand me that tool." He places it directly in someone's palm. "Barry, fix this system\
  \ real quick." "Define quick," he responds, already pulling out a diagnostic report. He's not\
  \ trying to be difficult - he just needs precision.
LITERAL.description.1.CIVILIAN=If a contract says "supplies will be provided as available,"\
  \ Barry will absolutely demand clarification on what "available" means. If a report says\
  \ someone was "lost in action," he will not accept it unless he gets clear details. It makes\
  \ negotiations painful - but it also prevents a lot of costly mistakes.
LITERAL.description.2.CIVILIAN="How's the company holding up, Barry?" someone asks. He doesn't\
  \ sugarcoat it. "We've lost 32% of our working Mechs, supply reserves are critical, and we're\
  \ two payroll cycles from insolvency." No one ever wants to hear his reports, but Barry won't\
  \ lie, won't soften the truth. Because in a world where everyone tries to mask the inevitable,\
  \ someone has to face it head-on.

LOCKS.label=Checks Locks Repeatedly
LOCKS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry double-checks every hatch, seal, and weapons locker\
  \ before and after deployment. "If you assume something's secure, that's when it isn't," he\
  \ mutters, tugging at a latch one more time. His squad jokes that he'd probably check the\
  \ airlock itself if they let him - but no one complains when his obsessive habits keep them alive.
LOCKS.description.1.COMBATANT=It doesn't matter if they're bunked down in a secure zone or\
  \ camping in enemy territory - Barry will always check every entrance, every lock, every secured\
  \ weapon. "You laugh now," he says, rattling the latch again, "but the one time I don't do this,\
  \ we'll get jumped in our sleep."
LOCKS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry used to trust that locked doors stayed locked. He doesn't\
  \ anymore. He remembers the time a door didn't seal, the time an enemy slipped through unsecured\
  \ defenses, the time someone he was supposed to protect didn't make it. Now, he checks every\
  \ lock, every latch, every seal - because if something does go wrong, at least he'll know it wasn't\
  \ his fault this time.
LOCKS.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry runs things like a fortress. If a locker is supposed to be\
  \ locked, he'll verify it three times. If a storage bay has security codes, he personally resets\
  \ them. No one gets unauthorized access on his watch - partially because he's paranoid, and\
  \ partially because he really enjoys telling people no.
LOCKS.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry always double-checks the locks. If someone says a door is\
  \ sealed, he'll check anyway. If someone insists an override is definitely disabled, he'll still\
  \ run his test. It's not personal - he just knows better than to trust assumptions.
LOCKS.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry locks things because he knows what happens when you don't.\
  \ He's seen desperate refugees raid supply caches, saboteurs slip into barracks, doors that\
  \ should have held shattered when it mattered most. He can't control the war, the contracts, the\
  \ inevitable losses - but he can make sure that, for now, the doors stay locked.

MEASURED_TALKER.label=Tends to Speak in a Measured Pace
MEASURED_TALKER.description.0.COMBATANT=No matter how intense the battle gets, Barry's voice never\
  \ wavers. He delivers orders with the slow, deliberate cadence of someone who refuses to be\
  \ rushed. "Adjust... thirty meters left... fire." His squad swears that hearing him on comms is\
  \ almost calming - until they realize that if Barry's still speaking that way, things must be even\
  \ worse than they thought.
MEASURED_TALKER.description.1.COMBATANT=While others shout over each other, Barry waits. He listens,\
  \ thinks, then speaks carefully. "We engage now, we overextend. We wait ten seconds, we flank."\
  \ He refuses to let adrenaline dictate his decisions, and while it frustrates more aggressive\
  \ warriors, his squad has learned to trust him.
MEASURED_TALKER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry used to talk faster, used to joke, used to care more.\
  \ Now, every word is deliberate, like he's trying not to waste them. He's seen too many people\
  \ speak their last words before they even knew they'd die. So now, he speaks like he's making\
  \ sure every sentence matters. Because someday, he won't get another one.
MEASURED_TALKER.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry talks like he's drafting a contract in real time. Whether\
  \ it's discussing orders, timelines, or options, every word is deliberate, precise. No one ever\
  \ walks away confused - but they do sometimes walk away wondering if they just got outmaneuvered in\
  \ a simple conversation.
MEASURED_TALKER.description.1.CIVILIAN=When Barry explains a process, he does it slowly, clearly, and\
  \ with no room for misunderstanding. "You will disconnect the relay. You will not touch the\
  \ exposed wiring. If you do, you will absolutely die." Whether he's training rookies or giving\
  \ mission updates, his methodical speech ensures that no one can claim they didn't hear him.
MEASURED_TALKER.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry doesn't raise his voice, doesn't rush his words, doesn't\
  \ waste breath. He speaks with the weight of someone who has already delivered bad news too many\
  \ times. When he tells a soldier, "You'll be fine," they believe him. When he says, "There's\
  \ nothing more I can do," they know he's already tried everything.

MINIMALIST.label=Extreme Minimalism
MINIMALIST.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's kit is stripped down to the absolute essentials - no\
  \ extra ammo, no backup gear, no sentimental keepsakes. "More weight slows you down," he says,\
  \ tightening the one pouch he allows himself. His lance teases him for it, but when they're\
  \ struggling under overstuffed packs and he's still moving, they start to reconsider.
MINIMALIST.description.1.COMBATANT=No unnecessary attachments, no redundant weapons, no fancy\
  \ tech. Barry keeps his loadout simple - because simple works. "You don't need a dozen backup\
  \ plans," he says, securing his sidearm. "You need one that won't fail." It's an efficient\
  \ mindset, but some worry it's less about discipline and more about not wanting to get attached\
  \ to anything.
MINIMALIST.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry owns nothing he wouldn't be willing to leave behind. No\
  \ personal items, no extra gear, no home to return to. He fights with what he carries, and if he\
  \ has to abandon it tomorrow, he will. Because war takes everything eventually - better to live\
  \ like you've already lost it all.
MINIMALIST.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry doesn't believe in excess. Everything in his workspace is\
  \ accounted for and necessary. If it's not useful, it's gone. "Extra gear is just dead weight,"\
  \ he mutters, denying yet another request for nonessential items. Efficiency isn't just a\
  \ goal - it's the rule.
MINIMALIST.description.1.CIVILIAN=No unnecessary tasks, no excessive reports, no overcomplicated\
  \ solutions. Barry patches what needs patching, nothing extra. "Good enough is good enough," he\
  \ says, stepping back from another just-functional-enough fix. It keeps things running - but some\
  \ worry that one day, his definition of 'good enough' won't be enough.
MINIMALIST.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry doesn't just live simply - he removes everything that\
  \ doesn't serve a purpose. Personal items? A distraction. Extra gear? Just something to lose.\
  \ Relationships? Harder to let go of than supplies, but just as fleeting. If he only keeps what's\
  \ necessary, maybe it won't hurt so much when it all falls apart.

MUG.label=Prefers Using a Specific Mug
MUG.description.0.COMBATANT=Before every mission, Barry drinks from his mug. Doesn't matter\
  \ if it's coffee, tea, or a protein shake - it only counts if it's in the same battered, slightly\
  \ dented, and thoroughly stained cup. His squad doesn't question it. Given how many battles he's\
  \ survived, they figure it might actually be lucky.
MUG.description.1.COMBATANT="The shape keeps the liquid at the optimal temperature," Barry\
  \ insists, sipping from his one and only mug. "The handle has perfect weight distribution." He\
  \ refuses to use any other cup, even if it means rinsing it out in battlefield runoff before\
  \ pouring another drink. His squad has long since accepted that the mug goes where he goes.
MUG.description.2.COMBATANT=The mug has been with him longer than most of his comrades.\
  \ He's left planets behind, lost equipment, abandoned people - but this remains. Barry doesn't\
  \ talk about where he got it or why he won't replace it. He just holds it a little tighter on the\
  \ nights when the war feels particularly close.
MUG.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry keeps things running like clockwork, but if anyone so much\
  \ as touches his mug, they're in for a lecture. "You want coffee? Fine. You don't use this mug."\
  \ He's signed off on impossible job lists without blinking, but the day someone borrowed his mug?\
  \ That was a crisis.
MUG.description.1.CIVILIAN=There could be an emergency, a full company deployment, a\
  \ reactor on fire - but Barry will not start work without drinking from his one mug. "Things\
  \ function better with consistency," he says, taking another sip. The fact that he talks about\
  \ his mug the same way he talks about people is concerning.
MUG.description.2.CIVILIAN=The bunk, the uniform, the gear - it all belongs to the company.\
  \ It all changes with every contract, every deployment. But the mug? The mug is his. The one\
  \ thing that hasn't been replaced, reassigned, or lost to war. If he ever loses it, he's not sure\
  \ what will be left of him.

NAIL_BITER.label=Constant Nail Biter
NAIL_BITER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't flinch under fire, doesn't panic when missiles\
  \ rain down - but his fingers tell a different story. His nails are jagged, bitten down to near\
  \ nothing, the casualty of endless waiting, briefing delays, and long hours in the scrum. It's\
  \ not fear, he insists. Just something to do while the next battle looms.
NAIL_BITER.description.1.COMBATANT=Mid-firefight, mid-strategy meeting, mid-conversation - Barry's\
  \ fingers are always near his mouth, absentmindedly gnawed as he thinks. "Barry, stop biting your\
  \ damn nails," someone mutters over comms. A second of silence, then: "Huh? Oh. Right." It lasts\
  \ maybe five minutes before he starts again.
NAIL_BITER.description.2.COMBATANT=His hands shake after missions, so he bites his nails. It gives\
  \ him something to focus on, something small to control when everything else spirals beyond his\
  \ grasp. If his fingers are raw, if his nails are ruined - well, at least it's proof he's still\
  \ here. At least it's his own damage, not someone else's.
NAIL_BITER.description.0.CIVILIAN=His job is a battlefield of its own, and Barry feels every\
  \ engagement. Inventory shortages, delayed shipments, missing tools - each issue gets a little more\
  \ nail chewed away. "We're short on fusion coolant again?" he mutters, biting the edge of his\
  \ thumbnail. If he had an intact fingernail left, it would be a miracle.
NAIL_BITER.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry works fast, his brain running just ahead of his hands, his\
  \ teeth worrying at his nails between quick repairs. "Hold still, almost done - just let me - "\
  \ crunch. The nervous habit doesn't slow him down, but his tools are often slick with antiseptic\
  \ from another self-inflicted cut.
NAIL_BITER.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry doesn't talk about his stress. He doesn't lash out,\
  \ doesn't break things, doesn't complain. Instead, his nails are bitten down to raw, torn messes,\
  \ silent proof of the pressure grinding him down. It's the only thing he allows himself - the only\
  \ wound he's willing to show.

NICKNAMING.label=Frequent Nicknaming
NICKNAMING.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry almost never calls his teammates by their actual names.\
  \ The rookie pilot? 'Hotshot.' The team's allocated tech? 'Sparky.' The commander? 'Big Boss.'\
  \ Half the unit has stopped correcting him, because by the time they do, he's already come up\
  \ with another one.
NICKNAMING.description.1.COMBATANT="Alright, Thunderfist, you take point. Stickbug, you cover the\
  \ left flank. Princess, you - " "Barry, I swear to god, stop calling me that." But Barry doesn't\
  \ stop. Ever. Once he's assigned a nickname, it sticks. If you don't like it? Too bad. That just\
  \ makes him say it more.
NICKNAMING.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry hands out nicknames like candy. It's easier than\
  \ remembering real names - because real names come with memories. With losses. With faces he'd\
  \ rather not picture when he tries to sleep. As long as they're 'Razor' or 'Gunsmoke' or\
  \ 'Scrappy', he doesn't have to think about how many real names he's already had to cross out.
NICKNAMING.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry doesn't believe in titles. The lead mechanic is 'Grease,'\
  \ the MedTech is 'Patches,' and the newest recruit is 'Fresh Meat' until they earn something\
  \ better. It's all part of the company's culture now - at this point, even he probably doesn't\
  \ remember their real names.
NICKNAMING.description.1.CIVILIAN=Everyone who works with Barry gets a nickname, and once he\
  \ assigns one, it's yours for life. The problem? They don't always make sense. "Hey, 'Wires,'\
  \ pass me that wrench." "Barry, I'm not an electrician." "Don't argue with me, Wires." The\
  \ name sticks. It always sticks.
NICKNAMING.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry gives out names because it means someone sees you.\
  \ Military units burn through people fast - soldiers, techs, medics, clerks. Most of them get a\
  \ number on a payroll log and little else. But if Barry calls you 'Chief' or 'Rookie' or\
  \ 'Grimlock,' it means you existed. Even if only for a little while.

NIGHT_OWL.label=Night Owl
NIGHT_OWL.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry is at his best when the sun's down. While the rest of the\
  \ squad struggles through late-night operations, he's fully alert, reacting faster, making\
  \ sharper calls. "Midnight raids, night drops, stealth ops? That's my time to shine," he says,\
  \ adjusting his visor. Some wonder if he even sleeps - or if he just waits for daylight to pass.
NIGHT_OWL.description.1.COMBATANT=While the squad sleeps, Barry patrols, cleans his gear, and\
  \ tunes his HUD. "Somebody's gotta be awake," he says, sipping yet another cup of bitter coffee.\
  \ He insists it's not paranoia - he just prefers the quiet, the way the battlefield feels different\
  \ under starlight.
NIGHT_OWL.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry stays up not because he wants to, but because sleep\
  \ brings things he doesn't want to see. Memories of burning cities, last words over broken comms,\
  \ the slow count of names he's lost. The night is quiet. And if he keeps his eyes open long\
  \ enough, maybe he won't have to dream at all.
NIGHT_OWL.description.0.CIVILIAN=If you need something from Barry, better check after\
  \ midnight - because that's when he's actually working. Inventory manifests? Updated at 3 AM.\
  \ Reports? Submitted right before dawn. The company has learned to just roll with it. "You can do\
  \ this at a normal time, you know." "Yeah, but I won't."
NIGHT_OWL.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry's tools are always in motion long after everyone else has\
  \ passed out. Diagnostics, late-night assignment overhauls, last-minute job lists? That's when he\
  \ gets his best work done. "No distractions, no idiots asking questions - just me and the\
  \ machines," he says, taking a sip of something that definitely isn't just coffee.
NIGHT_OWL.description.2.CIVILIAN=The company's debts. The worn-out equipment. The empty beds of\
  \ warriors who aren't coming back. Barry stays awake long after the others sleep, because someone\
  \ has to see it, to witness the slow collapse. He won't talk about it, won't wake anyone up - but\
  \ every night, he's there, staring at the ceiling, wondering how much longer it'll all last.

NOTE_TAKER.label=Compulsive Note-Taking
NOTE_TAKER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry keeps a small, weathered notebook strapped to his gear.\
  \ Enemy movements, ammo counts, battle formations - if it happens, he writes it down. Some joke\
  \ that he's trying to become a war historian, but when his notes reveal enemy patterns before\
  \ command does, no one's laughing.
NOTE_TAKER.description.1.COMBATANT=Every briefing, every engagement, every conversation - Barry is\
  \ writing. Notes in a datapad, shorthand scribbled on the back of his glove, coordinates\
  \ scratched into the inside of his cockpit. "Memory's unreliable," he says, flipping through\
  \ pages of previous battles. "Records last."
NOTE_TAKER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry writes names. He writes dates. He writes everything\
  \ because he's seen too many people vanish without a trace. No records. No burial. Just gone. So\
  \ he records them, their stories, their moments - because in a war where people disappear\
  \ overnight, maybe this way, they'll still exist.
NOTE_TAKER.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry's logs are legendary. Every job, every tool, every\
  \ assignment is recorded somewhere. "Paper trails save lives," he mutters, flipping through his\
  \ notes to prove - again - that the last batch of supplies was signed out three days ago. No one ever\
  \ wins arguments with Barry.
NOTE_TAKER.description.1.CIVILIAN=Every shift, every report, every single action Barry takes gets\
  \ documented and his notes are meticulous. If someone asks for a status update, he doesn't\
  \ speak - he hands them a log entry with timestamps, materials used, and a breakdown of everything\
  \ that happened.
NOTE_TAKER.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry keeps too many notes. Not just equipment statuses and\
  \ mission briefings, but the slow decay of everything around him. Fuel shortages. Unpaid wages.\
  \ The steady reduction of names in the payroll log. One day, someone will look back at his\
  \ records and see exactly when the company started dying. But for now, only he's paying\
  \ attention.

NOTEBOOK.label=Always Carrying a Notebook
NOTEBOOK.description.0.COMBATANT=Enemy formations, heat sink efficiency, which teammate still\
  \ owes him money - Barry documents it all. His notebook is crammed with mission notes, tactical\
  \ sketches, and half-finished thoughts written in hurried shorthand. "If I forget, it's my fault.\
  \ If I write it down, it's fact."
NOTEBOOK.description.1.COMBATANT=While others rely on intuition, Barry checks his notes. "Last\
  \ time we fought a lance like this, they favored a pincer maneuver," he mutters, flipping back\
  \ through pages. Some scoff at his reliance on old scribbles - until they realize his predictions\
  \ are almost always right.
NOTEBOOK.description.2.COMBATANT=Names of fallen comrades. Coordinates of battles no one\
  \ remembers. A tally of shots fired, Mechs destroyed, debts unpaid. Barry writes it all down\
  \ because if he doesn't, it'll be like it never happened. He doesn't trust history to remember\
  \ the truth. That's his job.
NOTEBOOK.description.0.CIVILIAN=No matter what someone needs Barry has it written down. "I\
  \ logged that two weeks ago," he says, flipping through pages, already finding the answer before\
  \ anyone else even thinks to check a terminal. His system isn't digital, but it never fails.
NOTEBOOK.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry doesn't rely on memory. Every job requested, every\
  \ procedure performed, every minor incident - all of it goes in the notebook. He doesn't always\
  \ explain why he records so much, but if someone asks, he simply says, "Because someone has to."
NOTEBOOK.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry's notebook isn't just logs - it's a record of decline.\
  \ Ration cuts, missing payments, the names of warriors who never came back. He writes it all\
  \ because no one else does. Because someday, the company will fall apart completely. And someone\
  \ should at least remember how it happened.

OBJECT.label=Carries a Personal Object
OBJECT.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry never enters battle without his one personal item - a lucky\
  \ coin, a worn-out playing card, a patch from an old uniform. "You don't mess with luck," he\
  \ says, tucking it into his pocket before every mission. Whether it actually helps or not, his\
  \ squad knows better than to question it.
OBJECT.description.1.COMBATANT=In the chaos of war, Barry keeps one thing constant. Maybe it's\
  \ a trinket from home, maybe it's something given to him by someone long gone. It doesn't matter\
  \ what it is - what matters is that it's his. When the battle's over and the adrenaline fades, he\
  \ grips it tight, reminding himself that he's still here.
OBJECT.description.2.COMBATANT=The object in Barry's possession isn't sentimental - it's\
  \ survival. A reminder of who he used to be, of a promise he couldn't keep, of a person he once\
  \ knew. He doesn't talk about it, doesn't let anyone touch it, doesn't explain why he refuses to\
  \ part with it. Some wounds don't bleed, but they never heal either.
OBJECT.description.0.CIVILIAN=Whether it's a well-worn multitool, an old pocket watch, or a\
  \ scrap of a long faded photo, Barry's always carrying something familiar. "You gotta have\
  \ something of your own in a job like this," he says. No one knows where he got it, but they know\
  \ he'd notice immediately if it ever went missing.
OBJECT.description.1.CIVILIAN=Barry's job changes, his location changes, the people around him\
  \ change - but one thing never does. That personal item, the thing always tucked into a pocket,\
  \ clipped to his belt, or hidden inside his jacket. It's not about sentimentality. It's about\
  \ having something that stays the same.
OBJECT.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry doesn't keep his special object because it makes him\
  \ happy. He keeps it because it reminds him of what's been lost. A tag from a dead comrade, a\
  \ ring from a life left behind, a torn page from a book he never got to finish. He doesn't talk\
  \ about it. He doesn't need to. Anyone who looks into his eyes when he holds it already\
  \ understands.

ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.label=Obsessive Tendencies
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just follow orders - he perfects them. Whether it's\
  \ drilling a maneuver until it's second nature or recalibrating his weapon for the third time in\
  \ an hour, he won't stop until every variable is accounted for. His squad teases him for being\
  \ too precise - until they see him land a shot no one else could make.
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.1.COMBATANT=If an enemy gets away, Barry remembers. If a battle doesn't go\
  \ exactly as planned, he analyzes it endlessly. His obsession with what should have happened\
  \ keeps him awake at night, scribbling notes and running scenarios. The squad tells him to let it\
  \ go, but deep down, they know - his fixation makes him dangerous.
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's obsessiveness isn't just habit - it's desperation. He\
  \ can't stop tweaking his loadout, refining battle plans, checking his gear again and\
  \ again - because the moment he stops? The moment he trusts things to go as expected? That's when\
  \ people die. And he's already lost too many.
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.0.CIVILIAN=Barry doesn't just do his job - he masters it and triple-checks\
  \ everything. "There is no such thing as an acceptable margin of error," he mutters while going\
  \ over numbers again. Others may get frustrated with his constant rechecking, but they also\
  \ know - if Barry says it's right, it's right.
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.1.CIVILIAN=No matter the task Barry refuses to call something finished\
  \ until it meets his impossibly high standards. "It's fine," someone tells him. "No," he replies,\
  \ making one last adjustment. "It's correct." The rest of the team has learned to let him\
  \ work - because once he's satisfied, the job is done right.
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry's attention to detail isn't about perfection - it's about\
  \ control. He can't stop the war. He can't stop people from dying. But he can make sure that this\
  \ form is filed correctly. Because if he ever lets his mind wander to the things he can't fix,\
  \ he's not sure he'll come back from it.

ORGANIZER.label=Always Organizing
ORGANIZER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's gear is always perfectly arranged - pants folded, boots\
  \ cleaned and stored in exact order, emergency rations packed in a precise grid. His squad teases\
  \ him about it, but when they need something fast in the middle of a fight, he's the one who\
  \ always knows where to find it.
ORGANIZER.description.1.COMBATANT=Before every battle, Barry insists on running a final check.\
  \ Formation assignments? Confirmed. Backup comms? Verified. Extraction routes? Plotted and\
  \ re-plotted. "The battlefield is messy enough," he mutters. "No reason we have to be." The\
  \ others may roll their eyes, but when things go wrong, his plans are why they make it out alive.
ORGANIZER.description.2.COMBATANT=War is disorder, destruction, entropy. Barry fights back the\
  \ only way he can - by making sure his world stays structured. His clothes are perfectly aligned in\
  \ his locker. His boots are arranged at precise angles. His gear is exactly where it needs to be.\
  \ Because if he ever lets the chaos creep in, he knows it'll take more than just his\
  \ equipment - it'll take him, too.
ORGANIZER.description.0.CIVILIAN=It doesn't matter if he's relaxing, performing his duties, or\
  \ handling reports - Barry makes sure everything is where it's supposed to be. Files? Sorted.\
  \ Tools? Arranged by frequency of use. Supplies? Restocked and labeled. No one questions his\
  \ methods anymore - because when they need something fast, Barry already has it ready.
ORGANIZER.description.1.CIVILIAN=A cluttered workspace? Unacceptable. A jumbled manifest?\
  \ Unthinkable. If Barry walks into a messy storage room, he will reorganize it. "I don't care if\
  \ you know where everything is," he mutters, shifting crates into a more logical layout. "You'll\
  \ know where it is, and it'll make sense." The others sigh, but they also know - his system works.
ORGANIZER.description.2.CIVILIAN=Barry can't stop the war. He can't save everyone. But he can\
  \ make sure the medical kits are stocked, the equipment is sorted, the files are in perfect\
  \ order. If he controls the little things, maybe - just maybe - it'll feel like he has control over\
  \ something. Because deep down, he knows: no amount of organization can stop the unit from\
  \ falling apart.
