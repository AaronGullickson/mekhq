ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.label=Constantly Adjusting Clothes
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.0.COMBATANT=Every strap, every buckle, every seal - Barry checks them all,\
  \ again and again. His battle gear is adjusted with the same precision no matter the circumstance.\
  \ He claims it's discipline, but in truth, it's a ritual to calm his nerves.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry never feels quite right in his gear, always tugging at a\
  \ strap or shifting his gloves even mid-firefight. To his lance, it's just a quirk, but those\
  \ who've fought beside him long enough know: Barry is always waiting for disaster. Maybe it's\
  \ because he's seen too many comrades get vaped by a laser, or maybe it's just instinct. Either\
  \ way, when Barry starts adjusting his gear a little too often, it's time to take cover.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.2.COMBATANT=His gear never fits right. His pistol holster is always too\
  \ tight or too loose. His boots rub raw against his heels. It doesn't matter what uniform he\
  \ wears or what battlefield he's dropped into - Barry will never be comfortable. Some say he's\
  \ fidgety. Others think he's just waiting for the day he won't need to adjust anything ever\
  \ again. Because dead men don't need to fix their collars.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry insists that every uniform, flight suit, and cooling vest\
  \ is properly fitted before deployment. If he sees a tech in a grease-stained jumpsuit with an\
  \ undone collar, they'll get an earful - because a ragged soldier is a careless one, and\
  \ carelessness gets people killed.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.1.SUPPORT=Between adjusting his sleeves and straightening his belt, Barry\
  \ runs logistics with unsettling speed. He can load a DropShip in record time while never once\
  \ standing still. Some think he's just high-strung, but the company keeps running because of him.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry believes if everything is in its place - uniforms pressed,\
  \ boots polished, reports properly filed - maybe, just maybe, fate won't notice him. But in a\
  \ military unit, paperwork means nothing when a JumpShip goes missing, or when the employer\
  \ decides your contract isn't profitable enough to honor. Barry keeps adjusting his cuffs,\
  \ knowing it won't save him.

AFFECTIONATE.label=Overly Affectionate
AFFECTIONATE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry fights like a demon and hugs like a bear. Before a\
  \ mission, he's patting backs, ruffling hair, and making sure everyone knows they're his 'battle\
  \ brothers and sisters.' Even in the middle of a firefight, he'll crack jokes and shout\
  \ encouragement over comms. Some love him for it - others just tolerate the inevitable post-mission\
  \ shoulder squeeze.
AFFECTIONATE.description.1.COMBATANT=In the modern military, most people keep their distance - losing\
  \ friends is inevitable. Not Barry. He remembers every name, every fallen comrade, and he'll\
  \ make damn sure no one in his unit dies feeling alone. Whether it's an arm around your shoulders\
  \ before battle or a whispered, "We've got this," before charging into hell, Barry refuses to let\
  \ the universe turn him cold.
AFFECTIONATE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's always there, hand on your shoulder, telling you that\
  \ everything's gonna be okay. He calls everyone "brother" or "sister," and he means it. But those\
  \ who've been around long enough notice something eerie - he's always closest to the ones who don't\
  \ make it back. It's almost like he can sense when it's someone's last fight. And when he gives\
  \ you that tight, lingering hug before deployment... well, you better hope he's wrong.
AFFECTIONATE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry runs things like a family dinner table, always checking if\
  \ you've eaten, gotten enough rest, and - somehow - if you're warm enough. He hands out coffee with a\
  \ reassuring pat on the back and calls the greenest recruits 'kiddo' regardless of their age.\
  \ Even the grizzled veterans can't stay mad at him for long.
AFFECTIONATE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry means well, but his tendency to clap people on the back,\
  \ sling an arm over their shoulders, or hug them when they least expect it has led to more than\
  \ one awkward moment. His warmth is rare, but let's be real - there's a reason HR gave him another\
  \ warning after that last Christmas party.
AFFECTIONATE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry makes sure everyone feels wanted, needed, remembered. He\
  \ laughs with the fresh-faced recruits, gives the mechanics a warm shoulder squeeze after a long\
  \ shift, and never lets a MechWarrior take off without a genuine, "Be safe, okay?" But in this\
  \ line of work, people disappear - sometimes violently, sometimes just gone between contracts.\
  \ Barry remembers all their names. And he never stops grieving.

APOLOGETIC.label=Overly Apologetic
APOLOGETIC.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry is a competent warrior, but you'd never know it from the\
  \ way he apologizes after every shot. Missed a target? "Sorry about that." Nailed a headshot?\
  \ "Hope that wasn't too brutal." Even enemy pilots getting cored out by his autocannon might hear\
  \ a muttered "Didn't mean for it to go that way..." over comms.
APOLOGETIC.description.1.COMBATANT=No matter where he is, Barry can't stop apologizing. He'll say\
  \ "Sorry" for calling a warning too late, for calling it too early, for asking a question, and\
  \ sometimes just for existing. He fights hard, but his lance suspects he'd apologize to an\
  \ inbound PPC if given the chance.
APOLOGETIC.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry says "Sorry" like a prayer. He apologizes to the comrades\
  \ he couldn't save, to the enemies he had to kill, and to himself for believing the fighting\
  \ would ever end. Maybe he's already dead inside, or maybe he's just waiting for the battlefield\
  \ to make it official. Either way, when Barry starts whispering apologies mid-firefight, it's a\
  \ bad omen.
APOLOGETIC.description.0.SUPPORT=Need ammo? "Sorry it took so long." Ration packs taste like\
  \ cardboard? "I'm really sorry about that." DropShip delayed by pirate activity? "Wish I could\
  \ fix it, truly." Barry apologizes for things that aren't his fault, but his relentless\
  \ politeness means people rarely yell at him - at least, not for long.
APOLOGETIC.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry is good at his job, but he'll never admit it. No matter how\
  \ well he manages things, he acts like a single misstep could doom the entire unit. He'll\
  \ triple-check orders, then apologize for bothering people about them. If you thank him, he'll\
  \ probably just say, "Oh, it wasn't much, really. Sorry if it was."
APOLOGETIC.description.2.SUPPORT=Military life is brutal, and when things go wrong, someone has to\
  \ take the fall. Barry, somehow, always ends up volunteering. A shipment lost to raiders? "I\
  \ should've arranged better security." A contract gone bad? "I should've checked the fine print."\
  \ Even when it's not his fault, Barry takes the weight of the unit's sins - and sooner or later,\
  \ the universe will demand payment.

BOOKWORM.label=Always Reading
BOOKWORM.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's never without a datapad, whether it's field manuals,\
  \ After-Action Reports, or ancient texts on combined-arms strategy. He absorbs tactics like a\
  \ sponge, always searching for an edge. If you see him flipping through a history book before a\
  \ mission, don't interrupt - he's probably looking for a maneuver that saved some long-dead\
  \ general's skin.
BOOKWORM.description.1.COMBATANT=Between battles, Barry's nose is buried in a book - anything from\
  \ war poetry to pre-spaceflight philosophy. He claims it helps him make sense of the chaos, but\
  \ his squad worries when he starts quoting lines about fate and inevitability right before a\
  \ drop. The last thing you want to hear before a firefight is someone musing about existential\
  \ doom.
BOOKWORM.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry keeps a small, battered notebook tucked inside his vest.\
  \ It isn't a journal, and it isn't for poetry. It's a list of names - every comrade he's lost,\
  \ every enemy he's killed, every contract that ended in blood. He reads it every night,\
  \ whispering each name like a mantra. One day, he knows, someone else will be reading his.
BOOKWORM.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry can fix a supply chain issue in minutes, negotiate a\
  \ contract loophole, and recite the complete corporate history of the Inner Sphere - mostly because\
  \ he reads everything. Need a regulation cited or an obscure planetary fact? Barry's already\
  \ flipping to the right page.
BOOKWORM.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's always reading, but the problem is when.\
  \ Mid-conversation? Eyes still on the book. Being addressed by the commander? "Yeah, yeah, one\
  \ sec." He'll draft an action plan while reading an old science-fiction novel and still do a\
  \ better job than anyone else, but it's an open question if he even knows what planet he's on\
  \ half the time.
BOOKWORM.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry reads because he has to. He studies ancient Terran\
  \ records, disaster reports, the economic collapses of entire planets. He says it's to learn from\
  \ the past, but deep down, he knows the truth - history doesn't repeat, it rhymes. And in this\
  \ business, the verse always ends in war, ruin, and silence.

CALENDAR.label=Keeps a Personal Calendar
CALENDAR.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry has every mission, training session, and equipment check\
  \ meticulously scheduled. He even sets reminders for "Check Ammo Reserves" and "Pre-Battle\
  \ Meditation." His lance laughs at him - until they realize he's never the one caught off-guard\
  \ when an op gets moved up at the last minute.
CALENDAR.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's calendar isn't just for logistics; it's full of birthdays,\
  \ contract anniversaries, and even the day he first met each member of his lance. He makes sure\
  \ to slip a small gift or a kind word to comrades on their special days. Some find it endearing,\
  \ others unsettling - because in this line of work, remembering dates also means remembering who\
  \ didn't make it to the next one.
CALENDAR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's calendar is obsessive. He logs every mission, every\
  \ deployment, every injury. He tracks trends - how long the average warrior lasts in the unit; how\
  \ many more battles his lance can take before the odds catch up. He's seen the numbers, and he\
  \ knows. There's a date circled in red, deep in the future. He won't say what it means, but he\
  \ checks it every day.
CALENDAR.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's calendar isn't just personal - it's the real company\
  \ schedule. Payroll deadlines, JumpShip departures, contract negotiations - he's got it all mapped\
  \ out. If the commander wants to know when they're leaving, they don't ask the XO. They ask Barry.
CALENDAR.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry believes mercenary life shouldn't be all death and logistics,\
  \ so he makes sure to schedule "Company Movie Night," "Optional Poker Tournament," and\
  \ "Morale-Boosting Happy Hour." Even the gruffest veterans roll their eyes at first - until they\
  \ find themselves actually looking forward to "Trivia Night, Hegemony Edition."
CALENDAR.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry keeps a calendar because someone has to. It tells him exactly\
  \ when the company's bank account will run dry, when their mechs will finally wear out, and when\
  \ their contracts will leave them stranded in hostile space. He keeps the bad news to himself for\
  \ now, but he's already penciled in "Final Dissolution of Unit" just in case.

CANDLES.label=Fond of Scented Candles
CANDLES.description.0.COMBATANT=The repair bays stink of sweat and burnt wiring, the barracks\
  \ always reek of gun oil, and the battlefield is worse. Barry fights the stink of war with an\
  \ arsenal of lavender, sandalwood, and citrus candles. His squadmates mock him - until they realize\
  \ his bunk actually smells nice.
CANDLES.description.1.COMBATANT=Before every battle, Barry lights a small candle in his\
  \ quarters or in the corner of a DropShip hangar. It's always the same scent, something that\
  \ reminds him of home - wherever that was. He doesn't talk about it, but those who've fought beside\
  \ him know: it's not just a habit. It's a tether, a way to remind himself there's still a world\
  \ beyond the blood and steel.
CANDLES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry used to share a tent, a bunk, or a barracks with someone\
  \ who loved scented candles. They're gone now, but their habit remains. Every time he lights one,\
  \ the memory lingers in the air like the smoke curling from the wick - fading, but never truly gone.
CANDLES.description.0.SUPPORT=The company barracks are cold, impersonal, and smell like old\
  \ metal - but not Barry's office. His desk is lined with small candles, filling the air with warm\
  \ vanilla, crisp pine, or exotic spices from some world he barely remembers. Even the grizzled\
  \ veterans find themselves stopping by just to breathe for a moment.
CANDLES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's love for scented candles has nearly gotten him banned\
  \ from multiple compounds. Between fire suppression alarms going off and that one time a candle\
  \ nearly ignited a munitions crate, he's been forced to compromise. Now he sticks to flameless\
  \ aromatherapy diffusers - but deep down, he knows it's not the same.
CANDLES.description.2.SUPPORT=The scent of blood, burning cities, and melted armor haunt\
  \ Barry's memories. He learned long ago that no amount of scrubbing can erase the past. But a \
  candle - one simple, flickering light - can mask it for just a little while. And when the wax burns\
  \ down to nothing, he knows it's time to light another.

CHEWING_GUM.label=Always Chewing Gum
CHEWING_GUM.description.0.COMBATANT=Explosions shake the ground, autocannon fire rips through\
  \ cover, and Barry just keeps chewing. His squad swears he's unflappable - always calm, always\
  \ focused, grinding his teeth through minty freshness while delivering precise, lethal fire. If\
  \ Barry ever spits his gum out in the middle of a fight, then you know things are bad.
CHEWING_GUM.description.1.COMBATANT=Whether he's gunning down enemy infantry, dodging PPC blasts,\
  \ or lining up a shot, Barry's always got a smirk and a fresh stick of gum. He pops it in like a\
  \ pre-battle ritual, as if to say, This is just another day at the office. And honestly? He\
  \ fights like he believes it.
CHEWING_GUM.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't chew gum for fun. He chews because if he stops,\
  \ his jaw clenches, his stomach knots, and the ghosts get a little louder. He's tasted blood,\
  \ smoke, and the bitter air of burning cities. But as long as he's chewing, as long as he\
  \ focuses on that single, repetitive motion, he can pretend - just for a little while - that things\
  \ are normal.
CHEWING_GUM.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry juggles manifests, schedules, and disputes all while\
  \ chewing a steady rhythm of bubblegum-flavored efficiency. If he's blowing bubbles in the middle\
  \ of a meeting, it means he's already outmaneuvered the other side.
CHEWING_GUM.description.1.SUPPORT=The constant snapping, popping, and chewing drives half the\
  \ company insane, but Barry refuses to stop. "It helps me focus," he says. And, somehow, it does.\
  \ He's the only one who can keep track of deployment schedules, cargo weights, and which planet\
  \ their next contract is on without breaking a sweat.
CHEWING_GUM.description.2.SUPPORT=There's not much softness in the military life - just rations,\
  \ burnt coffee, and the bitter taste of war. But gum? Gum reminds Barry that there used to be\
  \ shops, vendors, normalcy. Every time he unwraps a fresh stick, he pretends, for just a second,\
  \ that he's somewhere else. Somewhere safer. Somewhere that still exists.

CHRONIC_LATENESS.label=Chronically Late
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry is never on time, but somehow, he always shows up just\
  \ when things are about to go south. Whether it's rolling onto the battlefield in a hail of\
  \ fire, dropping into the fray seconds before an ambush, or sprinting to his post as the DropShip\
  \ doors open, he's living proof that "better late than never" sometimes does work.
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's alarms are always ignored, his comms are always buzzing\
  \ with angry messages, and he's always the last one suited up. No one knows how he still manages\
  \ to be an effective warrior, but somehow, he gets away with it. The day his luck runs out,\
  \ though, is going to be spectacularly bad.
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.2.COMBATANT=No matter how hard he tries, Barry is always one step behind.\
  \ He arrived late to the briefing where his lance was assigned their final mission. He reached\
  \ the rendezvous just in time to see the DropShip leaving without him. He sprinted to save his\
  \ best friend, but by the time he got there, the only thing left was blood. He keeps running,\
  \ keeps trying - but in the end, he's always too late.
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry is late to everything - staff meetings, supply runs,\
  \ deadlines - but when he finally shows up, he solves problems like no one else. Need a deadline\
  \ renegotiated? A missing shipment found? A discrepancy fixed? Just give him five more minutes\
  \ (or maybe thirty).
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.1.SUPPORT=Everyone in the company has learned to lie to Barry about\
  \ meeting times. If the briefing is at 0800, he's told 0730. If a shuttle departs at noon, he\
  \ gets an 1130 memo. He knows they do this. He still manages to be late.
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry wasn't always this way. He used to be punctual, precise.\
  \ But after a while, what's the point? Military units fall apart, contracts get broken, people\
  \ die. Schedules are just an illusion of control in a universe that doesn't care. So Barry lets\
  \ the minutes slip by, knowing deep down that, one day, there won't be any more time left.

CLEANER.label=Compulsive Cleaner
CLEANER.description.0.COMBATANT=Whether it's scrubbing down his gear, wiping every speck of dust\
  \ off his boots, or meticulously cleaning his bunk after a long mission, Barry keeps everything\
  \ spotless. He claims that "clean gear is reliable gear," and to his credit, he looks good.
CLEANER.description.1.COMBATANT=Before every mission, Barry polishes his sidearm, tightens every\
  \ strap, and scrubs the inside of his helmet until it gleams. Some say it's just ritual; others\
  \ think it's his way of dealing with the chaos of combat. Either way, his unit knows that when\
  \ Barry starts cleaning, it's a sign he's mentally preparing to face hell.
CLEANER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry is constantly wiping down his gear, scrubbing his hands, and\
  \ sweeping his bunk. No matter how much he cleans, though, the stains are never really gone. He's\
  \ haunted by the blood he couldn't wash away - whether it's his comrades', his enemies', or his\
  \ own, even he's no longer sure.
CLEANER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's workspace is a model of precision. Tools are perfectly\
  \ arranged, spare parts gleam under harsh lighting, and every surface is dust-free. Anyone who\
  \ messes up his spotless system is likely to get a mop shoved into their hands and a long lecture\
  \ on "basic respect for shared spaces."
CLEANER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry can't stand clutter, grime, or grease stains, which makes him\
  \ a constant presence in the repair bay. Whether he's scrubbing someone else's tools or wiping\
  \ down DropShip corridors, he's always cleaning something - and somehow, that relentless energy\
  \ keeps the whole operation running smoother.
CLEANER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry cleans because it's the only thing left that he can control.\
  \ He polishes the windows even though they look out on a dead world. He scrubs the briefing table\
  \ even though no one's gathered around it in weeks. One by one, the others are leaving, dying, or\
  \ simply giving up. Barry just keeps cleaning, as if he can scrub away the decay of a company\
  \ that's already rotting from within.

COLLECTOR.label=Collects Odd Items
COLLECTOR.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry has a knack for finding strange things in the ruins of\
  \ battlefields - enemy insignias, discarded dog tags, fragments of Mech armor with odd markings.\
  \ His squad jokes that he could start a museum, but they've all seen him pull out a bent bullet\
  \ casing mid-fight, rub it like a lucky charm, and somehow walk away unscathed.
COLLECTOR.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry collects junk. Old playing cards, broken holodisks,\
  \ half-melted action figures. He swears each one has a story, even if it's just "found it in a\
  \ burned-out bunker." Some say it's a harmless habit, but others worry - because Barry never throws\
  \ anything away, even the stuff that should be forgotten.
COLLECTOR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry keeps a little bag tied inside his jacket, filled with\
  \ small trinkets - items he's taken from the dead. A ration tin from a fallen comrade, an enemy\
  \ soldier's wristwatch, a child's toy found in the wreckage of a bombed-out city. He doesn't know\
  \ why he does it, only that every time he loses someone, he has to take something to remember\
  \ them. His collection keeps growing. It always grows.
COLLECTOR.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's supply closet isn't just stocked with spare parts and\
  \ ammo - it's got weird stuff. A pre-Hegemony coffee mug, an old recruitment poster, a stuffed\
  \ animal with one button eye. No one knows where he gets this junk, but somehow, he always has\
  \ exactly what you didn't realize you needed.
COLLECTOR.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry picks up odd relics from every planet the company\
  \ visits - outdated currency, antique tools, even random street signs. "Every piece of junk tells a\
  \ story," he says. But when someone asks why he's so obsessed with lost things, he just shrugs.\
  \ "If we don't remember them, who will?"
COLLECTOR.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry never leaves a battlefield without taking\
  \ something - sometimes a spent shell casing, sometimes a piece of fabric, sometimes a nameplate\
  \ from a wrecked Mech. It started as a way to remember fallen comrades, but now? He keeps things\
  \ from everyone - raiders, civilians, people whose names he never even knew. His collection is a\
  \ graveyard in miniature, and it will never be full.

COMPETITIVE_NATURE.label=Competitive Nature
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he has to win. Whether it's in\
  \ a bar brawl, a shooting contest, or a live-fire battlefield, he takes every engagement as a\
  \ personal challenge. He's the first to volunteer for high-risk missions just to prove he's the\
  \ best. One day, that attitude is going to get him killed.
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry turns everything into a competition. Who gets the\
  \ most confirmed kills? Who takes out the enemy Mech fastest? Who can pee the furthest? If\
  \ there's a scoreboard, real or imaginary, Barry's keeping track. His squad puts up with\
  \ it - mostly because, despite all the trash talk, he always buys the first round of drinks.
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just want to win - he needs to. When things\
  \ get desperate, he doesn't hesitate. He'll break rules, take risks no sane person would, leave\
  \ others behind if it means claiming victory. Because in the end, in war, second place is just\
  \ another name for dead.
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just file reports - he races against himself\
  \ to get them done faster than last time. Supply chains? He optimizes them like a battlefield\
  \ tactician. Budget allocations? He takes bets on how much he can shave off unnecessary expenses.\
  \ If you challenge him to an efficiency contest, you will lose.
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.1.SUPPORT=Poker night? Barry plays to win. PT drills? He'll run\
  \ extra laps just to prove he can. Even downtime isn't safe - he'll challenge you to arm wrestling,\
  \ trivia, or who can drink the most without passing out. The crew loves him, but sometimes they\
  \ wish he'd let something go just once.
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry tracks wins and losses, not just his own, but\
  \ everyone's. How many battles won, how many contracts failed, how many comrades lost. He used to\
  \ think if he could just get ahead, just win enough, it would mean something. But the names on\
  \ the "Losses" side of his ledger keep growing, and he's starting to realize - maybe, in this life,\
  \ nobody really wins.

COMPLIMENTS.label=Excessive Complimenter
COMPLIMENTS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry showers his teammates with praise, whether they just\
  \ pulled off a perfect ambush or simply reloaded their weapon without a jam. "Great shot! Perfect\
  \ footwork! Love the way you took cover behind that debris, textbook execution!" He's genuine\
  \ about it too - maybe too genuine. Even the most hardened veterans aren't sure how to respond when\
  \ he compliments their "exceptional battlefield posture."
COMPLIMENTS.description.1.COMBATANT=Enemy forces closing in? Barry still finds time to compliment\
  \ someone for their "magnificent trigger discipline" or the team's scout for "nailing that\
  \ stealthy approach." Some think it's just his way of keeping morale up. Others think he's\
  \ stalling, trying to keep himself from processing the violence happening around him.
COMPLIMENTS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's compliments aren't just encouragement. They're last\
  \ words in disguise. He wants the last thing someone hears before they die to be something good.\
  \ His lance knows that when he stops fighting to say, "You really handled that situation well,"\
  \ it means he doesn't think they're making it out alive.
COMPLIMENTS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry thinks everyone is amazing. The way the MechTechs replace\
  \ a fusion engine? "Brilliant." The way the warriors dock their Mechs? "Precision work." The way\
  \ the cook managed to make ration packs almost edible? "A culinary triumph." He hands out praise\
  \ so fast and frequently that no one's sure if he's being sarcastic - but he's absolutely serious.
COMPLIMENTS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry can make even the most jaded warriors uncomfortable with\
  \ his relentless positivity. Military companies are built on cynicism, but Barry? Barry will\
  \ look a tired, underpaid, underappreciated AsTech dead in the eye and say, "You're the backbone\
  \ of this operation. Without you, we're nothing." And damn it - sometimes that's exactly what they\
  \ need to hear.
COMPLIMENTS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry gives compliments like his life depends on it. Maybe, in a\
  \ way, it does. He wants to believe that if he acknowledges every small act of skill, courage, or\
  \ kindness, it matters. That in a universe of endless war and forgotten lives, someone's efforts\
  \ will be seen. Because if they aren't, if people are just lost and unremembered - then what was\
  \ the point of it all?

DAYDREAMER.label=Prone to Daydreaming
DAYDREAMER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry has a habit of staring off into the distance, lost in\
  \ thoughts of battlefield maneuvers and hypothetical scenarios. "What if we used a pincer\
  \ formation, but with jump-capable units repositioning mid-battle?" he mutters, mid-firefight.\
  \ His ideas are often brilliant - if only he'd stop zoning out long enough to share them before\
  \ bullets start flying.
DAYDREAMER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry fights because he has to, but his mind is always\
  \ elsewhere - strolling through the jungles of some uncharted world, watching the sunrise over a\
  \ crystalline ocean, or fighting through a battlefield that isn't real, where no one dies and\
  \ every shot is just for sport. War has a way of pulling him back to reality, violently.
DAYDREAMER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry spends more and more time staring into nothing, lost in\
  \ memories of places he's never been, people he's never met. He flinches at explosions a little\
  \ less than he used to. He doesn't even notice the warnings blaring in his HUD anymore. One day,\
  \ he won't snap back at all - his mind will keep drifting while his body is torn apart by war.
DAYDREAMER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry is great at his job - when he remembers he has one. One\
  \ second, he's calculating JumpShip fuel reserves; the next, he's staring at a loading crane,\
  \ imagining how much more efficient it would be if they redesigned the entire docking system.\
  \ Someone usually has to snap him out of it before he redesigns the payroll system instead.
DAYDREAMER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry dreams of things beyond war: a better future, a life\
  \ outside of contracts and bloodshed, a world where people don't have to sell their lives for\
  \ money. He writes down these ideas in an old, worn notebook. No one knows if he actually\
  \ believes in them, or if it's just a way to distract himself from the reality of his work.
DAYDREAMER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry reads old records, stories of lost worlds, of cities\
  \ untouched by war, of a time when life wasn't dictated by strategy and firepower. He dreams\
  \ about them, too - vivid, detailed dreams that feel more real than the dim, gray present. Maybe\
  \ it's just escapism. Or maybe, deep down, he knows he was born in the wrong century, and this\
  \ war-torn existence was never meant for him.

DOODLER.label=Compulsive Doodler
DOODLER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's field manual is covered in scribbles - little sketches of\
  \ battle formations, enemy Mech silhouettes, and doodled maps of planets he's never even been\
  \ to. His commanders are annoyed, but his squad swears that more than once, one of Barry's\
  \ absentminded sketches ended up being the key to surviving an operation.
DOODLER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's war journal is supposed to be for mission notes, but it's\
  \ filled with sketches of things not on the battlefield: towering trees from some distant world,\
  \ the face of a woman he can't quite remember, the endless stars above the DropShip bay. Maybe he\
  \ fights so one day he won't have to anymore.
DOODLER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry fills every spare scrap of paper with drawings - names carved\
  \ into ruined buildings, faces half-remembered, insignias from units that no longer exist. He\
  \ says he draws so he won't forget, but the way he looks at his sketches, like he's haunted by\
  \ them... maybe he already has.
DOODLER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's official reports always come back with little sketches in\
  \ the margins - better weapon mounting brackets, new DropShip layouts, a completely redesigned\
  \ coolant system. Some of his ideas are insane. Some get implemented. The tech crews have learned\
  \ to always check his notes
DOODLER.description.1.SUPPORT=Briefings, budget reviews, deployment schedules - Barry listens,\
  \ technically, but his notepad is always filled with little cartoons of his comrades, absurdly\
  \ detailed Mech drawings, or a sketch of the commander looking way too serious. Half the company\
  \ keeps his doodles as personal trophies.
DOODLER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's doodles have changed. Once, they were harmless, funny little\
  \ scribbles. Now, they're battlefields reduced to smoldering craters, Mechs collapsing in fire,\
  \ DropShips breaking apart in orbit. When asked about them, he just shrugs. "I don't know," he\
  \ says. "Sometimes I feel like I'm just drawing what's going to happen."

DOOLITTLE.label=Talks to Animals
DOOLITTLE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry will stop mid-patrol to have a full conversation with a\
  \ local stray or a scavenger bird perched on a ruined building. His lance teases him for it - until\
  \ a pack of giant canines doesn't attack them, or an avian swarm takes off suddenly, giving him\
  \ just enough warning before an ambush. Maybe Barry's just lucky. Or maybe the animals know\
  \ something the rest of them don't.
DOOLITTLE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't care much for the politics and ego battles of\
  \ military life. He's more comfortable talking to a DropShip's cat or a bunker rat than his\
  \ commanding officer. "Animals don't lie, and they don't stab you in the back for a bigger\
  \ payday," he says. "You could learn a thing or two from 'em."
DOOLITTLE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's seen too many comrades die. He's stopped trying to make\
  \ real connections with people - they never last. But animals? They don't ask questions. They don't\
  \ make promises they can't keep. And when Barry whispers to a half-starved dog before a\
  \ firefight, telling it to run and hide, it's not because he's worried about the mutt. It's\
  \ because, deep down, he knows it'll outlive him.
DOOLITTLE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry talks to every animal that wanders into camp - whether it's a\
  \ lizard sunning itself on a crate or a cargo bay rat sneaking rations. He's the reason the\
  \ company somehow has a "mascot," even though nobody remembers adopting it.
DOOLITTLE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry insists animals understand him. The company's techs were\
  \ skeptical - until he got a half-feral warehouse dog to stop stealing rations, or convinced a\
  \ colony of birds to roost outside the DropShip's exhaust ports instead of inside them. No one\
  \ knows how he does it, but it's saved them a lot of maintenance hours.
DOOLITTLE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has a habit of talking to stray animals like they're the\
  \ only ones who really understand him. He says things to them he'd never admit to another\
  \ human - his fears, his regrets, the things he's seen that still keep him up at night. "At least\
  \ you won't lie to me," he mutters to a one-eyed cat. It just stares at him, unblinking, as if it\
  \ knows.

DRAMATIC.label=Overly Dramatic
DRAMATIC.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry never just reloads - he flourishes like he's starring in a war\
  \ epic. He doesn't dive for cover, he hurls himself into it. Every fight is a set piece, every\
  \ victory a monologue waiting to happen. His squad rolls their eyes, but they have to admit - when\
  \ he pulls off a perfectly timed, slow-motion explosion escape, it's damn impressive.
DRAMATIC.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry describes battle like it's high art. "The PPC arcs like a\
  \ comet's tail, marking the end of an enemy's story," he mutters over comms. "The battlefield\
  \ sings with the percussion of autocannons and missile strikes." His lance just wants him to call\
  \ the damn targets, but he's too busy turning war into a performance.
DRAMATIC.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he plays a role. He wants his last stand\
  \ to be legendary, his name whispered in hushed tones long after he's gone. If he falls, it has\
  \ to be in a blaze of glory, outnumbered but never outmatched. The problem is... war doesn't care\
  \ about theatrics. And no one remembers the dead the way they think they will.
DRAMATIC.description.0.SUPPORT="Ah, once again we are denied the spare fusion engines we so\
  \ desperately need! Shall we resign ourselves to ICEs, or dare we defy fate and improvise?" Barry\
  \ narrates every minor setback like it's a Shakespearean tragedy. Somehow, the sheer absurdity of\
  \ it makes the bureaucracy almost tolerable.
DRAMATIC.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just deliver status reports - he performs them. He\
  \ gestures wildly, paces like a stage actor, and gasps in mock horror at every budget cut. The\
  \ higher-ups are exasperated, but his dramatic delivery actually keeps people awake during\
  \ meetings, so they tolerate him. Barely.
DRAMATIC.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry speaks in grand, sweeping terms because he knows the truth:\
  \ in war, most lives are forgotten, reduced to a footnote in someone else's report. He refuses to\
  \ let that happen. He remembers the dead, tells their stories, makes their sacrifices matter.\
  \ Even if no one listens. Even if, in the end, he'll be forgotten too.

EATING_HABITS.label=Unpredictable Eating Habits
EATING_HABITS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry will go an entire day without eating, only to inhale\
  \ three full MREs right before a drop. Sometimes, he forgets to eat at all, other times, he's\
  \ gnawing on a ration bar mid-firefight. His squad has stopped questioning it - except for the time\
  \ he casually sipped a protein shake while under heavy fire.
EATING_HABITS.description.1.COMBATANT=One day, Barry is choking down cold canned meat in a muddy\
  \ foxhole like everyone else. The next, he's somehow managed to sear a cut of unknown protein\
  \ over an engine vent and is sprinkling scavenged spices on it. "Eat well when you can," he says,\
  \ as if anyone else has time for battlefield fine dining.
EATING_HABITS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry either forgets to eat for days or devours everything in\
  \ sight, like he's afraid there won't be another meal. He doesn't talk about it, but those who\
  \ know him well suspect he's been through famine, blockade, or a siege. He never wastes food. He\
  \ never complains about rations. Because he remembers when there wasn't anything to eat at all.
EATING_HABITS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry tracks every supply shipment, fuel order, and ration\
  \ count with precision - yet somehow, he always forgets to eat himself. It's not uncommon to find\
  \ him gnawing on a stale protein bar at 3 AM while recalculating fuel logistics, as if he just\
  \ remembered that human beings require sustenance.
EATING_HABITS.description.1.SUPPORT=One day, Barry is eating gourmet-grade imported beef from a\
  \ high-end merchant. The next, he's happily spooning up a cold can of something labeled only as\
  \ "Meat Product." Nobody can predict what he'll eat next, and at this point, no one dares try.
EATING_HABITS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry eats like someone who's seen real hunger. He never\
  \ throws food away, never turns down a meal, and has a habit of keeping emergency rations even\
  \ when food is plentiful. Sometimes, he chews slower, as if trying to make each bite last,\
  \ staring at his plate like he's seeing something the rest of them can't - like he's remembering.

ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.label=Extreme Environmental Sensitivity
ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.description.0.COMBATANT=Whether it's too hot, too cold, too humid, or too\
  \ dry, Barry will let you know. "I swear, this desert heat is melting me." "This jungle humidity\
  \ is literally trying to kill me." Yet, despite his endless gripes about the conditions, he's\
  \ still right there in the thick of it, fighting like hell. Complaining is just part of his\
  \ battlefield routine.
ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry is miserable in extreme conditions, but he\
  \ always finds ways to cope. On an ice world? He's hoarding heat packs in his boots. Stuck in a\
  \ dust storm? He's wearing a scarf like some kind of post-apocalyptic bandit. His ability to\
  \ adapt is almost as impressive as his ability to suffer loudly.
ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.description.2.COMBATANT=Every harsh wind feels like the bite of an old\
  \ wound. Every humid jungle reminds him of the infections he barely survived. Every freezing\
  \ night brings back the ghost of near-hypothermia. Barry's body has been through hell, and now it\
  \ feels every shift in the weather like a lingering punishment.
ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry has a personal grudge against the entire\
  \ Inner Sphere. "This world is too dusty." "This one has toxic rain." "This one? Too much\
  \ gravity." He's a professional, but the moment he steps outside a temperature-controlled\
  \ building, he's loudly questioning why anyone thought this planet was worth fighting for.
ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has a personal stash of climate-control\
  \ gear that would make a survivalist jealous. Cooling vests, heated socks, humidifiers,\
  \ dehumidifiers - if there's a way to mitigate discomfort, he has it. He's always prepared, and if\
  \ you forgot to bring gloves to an ice world, you might be able to borrow some... for a price.
ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's body isn't built for this life. Every\
  \ drop in temperature burns his nerves. Every breath of thin atmosphere makes his lungs scream.\
  \ Every exposure to a new planet's toxic pollen, biting cold, or acidic rain grinds him down.\
  \ The universe is harsh, and Barry feels every bit of it. One day, his body just won't adapt\
  \ anymore.

EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.label=Excessive Caution
EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry double-checks everything. His lance rolls their\
  \ eyes when he insists on inspecting his gear one more time before deployment, but his weapon\
  \ never jams. He never walks into an ambush, never gets caught off guard - and when he tells the\
  \ unit, "Something doesn't feel right," they've learned to listen.
EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry refuses to rush. Every movement in combat is\
  \ deliberate, every approach is scouted, and every plan has a contingency. His unit grumbles when\
  \ he insists on re-checking their escape route for the third time - but when the first two go bad,\
  \ they don't complain anymore.
EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry survives. He's survived everything. He never\
  \ charges in, never takes unnecessary risks, never makes the fatal mistakes his comrades do. But\
  \ survival comes at a cost - he's always the one left standing, always the one pulling bodies from\
  \ wreckage, always the one left to bury the dead. He wonders if, one day, caution won't be enough.
EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry plans for every possible scenario. Need backup\
  \ rations? Already stocked. Emergency medical supplies? Got 'em. Redundant power systems?\
  \ Installed last week. Some say he's paranoid - until the day things go wrong, and he's the only\
  \ reason they survive.
EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry refuses to sign off on anything until he's read\
  \ every contract clause, cross-checked the budget, and confirmed the supplier's reputation. It\
  \ makes things excruciatingly slow, but it also means the company never gets scammed, shorted, or\
  \ stuck with defective equipment.
EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry isn't just cautious - he's aware. He sees the cracks\
  \ forming before anyone else does. He knows when a company is running on borrowed time, when a\
  \ contract is one mistake away from turning into a death sentence. He doesn't panic, doesn't\
  \ shout - he just watches, silent and grim, waiting for the inevitable collapse.

EXCESSIVE_GREETING.label=Over-the-Top Greetings
EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.0.COMBATANT=Whether it's a battlefield check-in or a casual\
  \ encounter in the barracks, Barry never greets anyone normally. "Ah-ha! My favorite sniper,\
  \ still breathing, I see!" "BEHOLD, THE ACE MECHJOCK RETURNS FROM ANOTHER GLORIOUS VICTORY!" Even\
  \ in the middle of combat, he'll key his comm just to yell, "GOOD MORNING, YOU MAGNIFICENT\
  \ BASTARDS!" It's impossible to ignore him - and, admittedly, hard to feel unappreciated.
EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry treats every greeting like a full-scale reunion.\
  \ Even if he saw you five minutes ago, he'll wave both arms, slap you on the back, and shout your\
  \ name like you've been missing for years. It's ridiculous - but in a profession where people do\
  \ disappear forever, nobody minds hearing, "Well, look who's still alive! Damn good to see ya!"
EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry greets everyone like they're his long-lost best\
  \ friend, because deep down, he knows - they might be gone tomorrow. He's seen too many empty\
  \ bunks, too many callsigns go silent, too many comrades blown apart mid-sentence. So he greets\
  \ everyone like it's the last time he'll ever get the chance. Because someday, it will be.
EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.0.SUPPORT=Walk into the depot, and you will be greeted. Loudly.\
  \ "Ah-HA! The HERO of the battlefield RETURNS to my humble domain! What grand treasures do you\
  \ seek today, O Mighty Warrior?" It's impossible to take him seriously - but it's also impossible\
  \ to leave in a bad mood.
EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just greet people, he performs an\
  \ introduction. Whether it's an exaggerated bow, a dramatic handshake, or an entire impromptu \
  speech about your accomplishments, he somehow turns entering a room into an event. The commander\
  \ tried to make him stop - until even the most exhausted warriors admitted they kind of liked it.
EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.2.SUPPORT=Sometimes, Barry slips up. He greets people who aren't\
  \ there anymore. "Jenkins! Damn good to see you!" Only to be met with silence, an empty bunk, or\
  \ a blank stare from someone who remembers Jenkins died last month. He laughs it off, pretends\
  \ it didn't happen. But deep down, he knows - one day, someone else is going to do the same thing\
  \ to his empty bunk.

EYE_CONTACT.label=Maintains Intense Eye Contact
EYE_CONTACT.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just look at people - he locks on like a targeting\
  \ system. Enemy lining up a shot? He stares them down through the HUD like he dares them to miss.\
  \ Comrade panicking under fire? He grips their shoulder and holds their gaze until they snap out\
  \ of it. His stare isn't just intense - it's commanding.
EYE_CONTACT.description.1.COMBATANT=Whether he's giving orders, lining up a shot, or listening to a\
  \ mission briefing, Barry does not blink. His lance jokes that he doesn't need targeting\
  \ computers - he just looks at a target long enough and the shot finds its mark. It'd be impressive\
  \ if it weren't so unsettling.
EYE_CONTACT.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's stare is hollow, deep, wrong. He looks through people,\
  \ past them, as if he's seeing something beyond the present moment. It's like he already knows\
  \ how this battle will end - how everyone's battle will end. And when he looks at you too long, you\
  \ start to wonder... does he see your fate, too?
EYE_CONTACT.description.0.SUPPORT=Trying to get extra rations? Claiming you never got issued ammo?\
  \ Barry doesn't even need to check the manifest. He just stares at you, silent, waiting. Within\
  \ seconds, most people break down and confess. "Okay, fine, I did take an extra case of heat\
  \ sinks. Just stop looking at me like that."
EYE_CONTACT.description.1.SUPPORT=A casual chat with Barry is anything but casual. He maintains\
  \ direct, unwavering eye contact the entire time, no matter how mundane the topic. Whether he's\
  \ talking about supply shipments or asking if you've eaten today, it always feels like he's\
  \ staring into your soul.
EYE_CONTACT.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just look at people - he memorizes them. The shape\
  \ of their scars, the flicker of hesitation in their voice, the way they tense when discussing\
  \ past battles. It's not just observation; it's cataloging. Because Barry knows that in a\
  \ military unit, faces disappear. And someone has to remember them.

FASHION_CHOICES.label=Eccentric Fashion Choices
FASHION_CHOICES.description.0.COMBATANT=While the rest of the squad sticks to standard-issue gear,\
  \ Barry finds ways to stand out. Maybe it's a bright red scarf tied around his combat armor, a\
  \ custom-painted helmet with flair, or a ridiculous pair of aviator shades that he insists\
  \ improve his targeting. He fights just as hard as anyone else, but he'll damned if he does it\
  \ without style.
FASHION_CHOICES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry has one piece of gear he refuses to part with - an old\
  \ leather jacket, a neon-colored sash, or maybe a battered hula girl that somehow survived a\
  \ cockpit ejection. He claims it's lucky. His squad claims it's a liability. But after seeing him\
  \ walk away from three near-death situations, nobody tells him to take it off anymore.
FASHION_CHOICES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's patches don't match. His gear is a mix of different\
  \ uniforms, scavenged from fallen mercs, lost comrades, or abandoned battlefields. He says it's\
  \ "just practical." But every piece has a name behind it, a story he won't tell. And when he\
  \ gears up, he's not just wearing armor - he's carrying ghosts.
FASHION_CHOICES.description.0.SUPPORT=Everyone else in the company wears standard fatigues. Barry?\
  \ Barry struts around the hangar in a velvet waistcoat, a brightly patterned scarf, or a jumpsuit\
  \ covered in custom patches from a dozen different mercenary outfits. He argues that if he has to\
  \ run support for a bunch of killers, he might as well look good doing it.
FASHION_CHOICES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's wardrobe is a mystery. One day, he's in a full\
  \ Hegemony officer's coat (with no explanation). The next, he's wearing knee-high boots and a\
  \ flamboyant sash like he's leading a parade. The only constant is that no one ever sees him wear\
  \ the same outfit twice. Where does he get this stuff? No one knows.
FASHION_CHOICES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's clothes don't fit the war-torn world he lives in.\
  \ His coats are pristine, his accessories impractical, his boots polished like he's about to\
  \ attend a grand ball instead of supporting a military unit. He dresses like he's from a world\
  \ that hasn't existed in centuries - as if, by refusing to acknowledge reality, he can pretend it\
  \ still does.

FIDGETS.label=Constantly Fidgeting
FIDGETS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry is always moving - tapping his fingers on his rifle, adjusting\
  \ his gloves, shifting his stance even when in cover. His lance used to think he was anxious, but\
  \ no - this is just how he operates. He says he fights better when he's in motion. And judging by\
  \ his reaction time, he might actually be right.
FIDGETS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's knee bounces when he's on a stakeout. His hands tap rhythms\
  \ when he's waiting to drop. His fingers drum against his sidearm before a fight. Some say it's\
  \ nerves, some say it's a bad habit - but whatever it is, it's impossible to ignore. His squad\
  \ isn't sure if it makes him more dangerous, or if one day, he's just going to snap.
FIDGETS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry fidgets because if he stops moving, his hands remember. They\
  \ remember the recoil of every shot, the weight of a dying friend, the texture of dried blood\
  \ under his nails. He plays with his gear, taps his fingers, shifts his stance - not because he's\
  \ impatient, but because stillness brings memories, and memories are worse than war.
FIDGETS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry is always doing something, even when he doesn't need to be. If\
  \ he's talking to you, he's also reorganizing crates, flipping a pen between his fingers, or\
  \ double-checking inventory counts that don't actually need to be checked. He calls it "efficient\
  \ multitasking." Everyone else calls it "exhausting to watch."
FIDGETS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't attend briefings so much as survive them. He taps on\
  \ tables, spins a data slate in his hands, or starts disassembling and reassembling whatever\
  \ piece of equipment is within reach. He swears it helps him focus, but more than once, a\
  \ commander has had to stop mid-sentence to tell him to put that back together.
FIDGETS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry keeps his hands busy, always. If he's moving, if he's doing\
  \ something, then maybe he won't think about how many people he's seen walk to their death, how\
  \ many jobs he's approved that led to ruin, how many times he's signed off on death orders\
  \ disguised as payroll. His hands shake when they're empty, so he makes sure they never are.

FITNESS.label=Extreme Personal Fitness Routine
FITNESS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just stay in shape - he pushes himself beyond reason.\
  \ If the squad is running drills, he's doing extra laps. If they're training, he's doing push-ups\
  \ between maneuvers. He treats his body like a weapon, and he's determined to keep it sharpened\
  \ at all times.
FITNESS.description.1.COMBATANT=If Barry can do something in a harder, more exhausting way, he\
  \ will. He sprints to his Mech instead of walking, does pull-ups on a DropShip's cargo racks, and\
  \ somehow turns reloading a missile rack into a full-body workout. "Gotta stay combat-ready," he\
  \ says, between sets of one-arm push-ups.
FITNESS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry trains like a man trying to break himself. He pushes through\
  \ injuries, ignores exhaustion, and punishes his body like it owes him something. Maybe he's\
  \ trying to outlast the war, or maybe he's just waiting for the day his body finally gives\
  \ out - because he knows the battlefield won't do it cleanly.
FITNESS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry may work support, but he's built like an elite commando. He\
  \ wakes up before the MechWarriors to train, runs extra PT drills, and somehow convinces\
  \ maintenance crews to do push-ups while waiting for system diagnostics. He insists it's just a\
  \ hobby, but when he casually deadlifts a supply crate meant for two people, no one's sure\
  \ anymore.
FITNESS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry turns everything into exercise. Organizing inventory? He\
  \ carries two crates at once for the added resistance. Long-haul travel on a JumpShip? He's doing\
  \ bodyweight workouts in zero-G. If he's standing still, he's probably clenching his abs just to\
  \ make sure he's "maximizing muscle engagement."
FITNESS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry trains like a man expecting the worst. Even though he runs\
  \ support, he preps like he'll be the last line of defense. His body is covered in\
  \ micro-injuries, stress fractures, and old bruises that never heal right. He says he just "likes\
  \ to stay in shape." But his eyes say he's afraid of what'll happen if he ever stops.

FIXATES.label=Fixates on One Topic
FIXATES.description.0.COMBATANT=Once Barry gets an idea in his head, nothing will get him to drop\
  \ it. If he's convinced a flanking maneuver is the best strategy, he'll argue about it until\
  \ deployment. If he thinks a certain Mech loadout is ideal, he'll lecture anyone who'll listen.\
  \ Sometimes it's annoying - but sometimes, he's right.
FIXATES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry has a special interest, and by God, you will hear about it.\
  \ Maybe it's the history of a specific battle, maybe it's the aerodynamics of autocannon rounds,\
  \ maybe it's the exact specifications of every BattleMech ever made. Whatever it is, once he\
  \ starts talking, there's no stopping him.
FIXATES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry latches onto a topic with desperation. He throws himself into\
  \ technical specs, tactics, anything that keeps his mind from wandering. He knows if he stops\
  \ thinking about this, he'll start thinking about everything else - the battles he's lost, the\
  \ friends who never made it back, the creeping realization that fighting never really ends.
FIXATES.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry has one passion: streamlining supply chains. He has charts. He\
  \ has diagrams. He's written essays about how they could shave seconds off deployment times. The\
  \ company's operations have never been smoother - but dear God, someone please get him to talk\
  \ about anything else.
FIXATES.description.1.SUPPORT=No matter where a conversation starts, Barry will bring it back to\
  \ his chosen topic. "Oh, you're talking about planetary weather patterns? That reminds me of how\
  \ desert conditions affect Mech heat sinks!" No one knows how he does it. No one wants him to do\
  \ it.
FIXATES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry fixates because if he doesn't, his mind starts wandering to\
  \ places it shouldn't. It's easier to focus on logistics, or Mech classifications, or the finer\
  \ points of battlefield tactics than to acknowledge what he's really doing - desperately clinging\
  \ to one thing in a universe that's constantly tearing everything else away.

FLASK.label=Carries a Flask
FLASK.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's flask isn't just for drinking - it's ritual. A sip before\
  \ battle for luck, a sip after for survival. He swears it keeps him steady, keeps the nerves from\
  \ creeping in. His lance jokes that he's pickling himself so he can live forever.
FLASK.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's flask is always full, and he's always willing to pass it\
  \ around. Before a mission, after a mission, in the middle of one if things are slow enough.\
  \ "Nothing wrong with a quick sip," he says, handing it over with a grin. No one's sure if it's\
  \ actual alcohol, battlefield coffee, or something worse - but whatever it is, it burns.
FLASK.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry drinks because if he doesn't, the memories come crawling back.\
  \ The faces of the dead, the screams over comms, the way burning metal smells just like burning\
  \ flesh. He's not drinking to get drunk - he's drinking to function. The flask is always with him.\
  \ It has to be. Because the moment it's empty, the past comes rushing in.
FLASK.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's flask isn't just for himself - it's for everyone. He's got a\
  \ special reserve for MechWarriors after a hard fight, a backup stash for celebrating a rare win,\
  \ and a hidden emergency bottle for when things really go to hell. His philosophy? A military\
  \ unit runs on money, ammo, and just enough booze to keep people sane.
FLASK.description.1.SUPPORT="It's just for the nerves," Barry says, casually taking a sip while\
  \ filing requests. "Good for circulation." He's got an excuse for every situation - cold weather,\
  \ bad food, long meetings. If he ever actually ran out, the entire admin staff would probably\
  \ collapse from shock.
FLASK.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't drink for fun. He drinks because he made choices - signed\
  \ orders that got people killed, approved supply runs that never made it back, trusted the wrong\
  \ people. The flask is his way of forgetting, if only for a moment. But no matter how much he\
  \ drinks, the ledger never balances.

FOOT_TAPPER.label=Always Tapping Foot
FOOT_TAPPER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's foot is always tapping - against the floor of the\
  \ DropShip, against the dirt in a trench, against the side of an ammo crate during a briefing.\
  \ It's like he's waiting for something to happen, like he's just a half-second away from bolting\
  \ into action. His squad has learned that when Barry's foot stops tapping, that's when things are\
  \ about to get serious.
FOOT_TAPPER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't sit still. His foot taps because his whole body\
  \ wants to move. He's the first one geared up, the first one out the DropShip, and the first one\
  \ pushing the pace in an assault. When he's forced to wait, he gets jittery, practically\
  \ vibrating with impatience. "Hurry up and get to the shooting part," he mutters, tapping away.
FOOT_TAPPER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's foot taps to a rhythm that no one else can hear. Maybe\
  \ it's an old war march, maybe it's the echoes of battles past, or maybe it's just his way of\
  \ staying present. He doesn't talk about it, but some nights, when everything is quiet, he's\
  \ still tapping. Like he's counting down to something only he knows is coming.
FOOT_TAPPER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's foot taps as he calculates supply orders, budget\
  \ projections, and shipment schedules in real-time. It's like his brain is moving too fast for\
  \ his body to keep up. The tapping isn't impatience - it's momentum. He's already thinking about\
  \ the next problem before anyone else even realizes there is one.
FOOT_TAPPER.description.1.SUPPORT=The tapping never stops. Boardroom table? Tap tap tap. Cargo bay\
  \ inspection? Tap tap tap. Even when he's standing still, the sound of his boot against the deck\
  \ is constant. No one knows if he's nervous, bored, or just wired differently - but after a while,\
  \ people start tapping along without realizing it.
FOOT_TAPPER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry taps his foot to remind himself he's alive. That he's\
  \ still moving, still breathing, still part of this world. Some nights, after too many bad\
  \ missions, he has to force his foot to tap - because if it stops, even for a second, he's afraid\
  \ he won't be able to start it again.

FORGETFUL.label=Chronically Forgetful
FORGETFUL.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry is a solid fighter, but damn if he doesn't always forget\
  \ something before a mission. Harness? Left it in the barracks. Comms check? Oops. Forgot to eat\
  \ before deployment? Absolutely. His squad has learned to double-check his gear along with their\
  \ own because, sooner or later, Barry is going to pat himself down and go, "Wait... where's my\
  \ sidearm?"
FORGETFUL.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry remembers battle tactics, enemy weak points, and how to\
  \ compensate for environmental conditions perfectly. But ask him what day it is? Who they're\
  \ fighting this week? Whether or not he ate before a mission? Gone. His mind is laser-focused on\
  \ combat, but the second they get back to base, he's back to asking, "Wait, what planet is this\
  \ again?"
FORGETFUL.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't forget because he's careless. He forgets because\
  \ his head is already full - full of old battlefields, old mistakes, old names. There's only so\
  \ much room in a person's memory, and Barry made a choice long ago: he'll never forget the\
  \ fallen, even if it means losing everything else.
FORGETFUL.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry is great at managing supplies. He remembers critical\
  \ shipment schedules, high-priority requests, and budget restrictions flawlessly. But somehow, he\
  \ always forgets one thing - sometimes minor, sometimes catastrophic. "Oh, we were supposed to\
  \ order coolant last cycle? Uh... whoops."
FORGETFUL.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry forgets names, times, and occasionally his own job title,\
  \ but somehow, the company still runs. He keeps the entire operation afloat through sheer\
  \ instinct, despite being the guy who asks, "Wait, did I eat today?" while running inventory\
  \ checks.
FORGETFUL.description.2.SUPPORT=At first, Barry just forgot little things - dates, meetings, faces.\
  \ Then it got worse. Entire conversations lost. Mission details slipping. A comrade's name, right\
  \ on the tip of his tongue, but... gone. He laughs it off, pretends it's nothing, but deep down, he\
  \ knows: one day, he's going to forget something that really matters. Maybe he already has.

FORMAL_SPEECH.label=Overly Formal Speech
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry delivers battlefield reports like he's speaking in a\
  \ royal court. "Sir, I must inform you that our current tactical position is most untenable." His\
  \ lance has given up trying to get him to talk like a normal human being, and at this point, they\
  \ just roll with it.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry insists on addressing even his closest comrades as\
  \ "Lieutenant," "Sergeant," or "esteemed colleague." No one knows if it's a quirk, a joke, or if\
  \ he actually thinks they're all attending a formal gala instead of wading through battlefield\
  \ wreckage. Either way, it makes war sound bizarrely polite.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry speaks like a man out of time, using words and phrases\
  \ that no one else does anymore. Maybe it's because he came from somewhere refined. Maybe it's a\
  \ desperate attempt to hold on to a piece of himself before war grinds him into dust like\
  \ everyone else. Or maybe... he knows that once he stops speaking this way, there'll be nothing\
  \ left of the person he used to be.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's supply reports don't just list numbers - they tell a\
  \ story. "It is with deep regret that I must inform you that our reserve ammunition stocks have\
  \ dwindled to perilous levels, necessitating swift resupply lest we court catastrophe." The\
  \ commander sighs, but at least someone in the unit is keeping things interesting.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just give briefings. He delivers them with the\
  \ gravitas of a statesman addressing a planetary congress. "Honored comrades, we find ourselves\
  \ at a most critical juncture in our fiscal projections." Everyone wishes he'd just say they're\
  \ running low on cash, but at least it makes budget meetings marginally less soul-crushing.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry speaks with eloquence and grace because someone has to.\
  \ The universe is brutal, war is endless, and civility is dying. If he starts talking like the\
  \ rest of them - cold, clipped, brutal - then what's left? Just another gun for hire, another cog in\
  \ the war machine. He refuses. Even if it makes him sound ridiculous, he refuses.

FURNITURE.label=Constantly Rearranges Furniture
FURNITURE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry treats every space like a battlefield map. Barracks layout?\
  \ He adjusts the bunks for "optimal emergency evacuation routes." DropShip lounge? The chairs\
  \ need to be "fortified positions in case of boarding actions." His squad rolls their eyes when\
  \ they find their lockers moved again - but deep down, they know he's probably not wrong.
FURNITURE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry never leaves a room the way he found it. He'll shift crates\
  \ in the hangar, move chairs around briefing rooms, and completely rearrange the break area just\
  \ because it didn't feel right. No one knows why he does it, but at this point, the unit just\
  \ waits for The Barry Edition of any given room before getting comfortable.
FURNITURE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry moves furniture not for comfort, but for survival. Every\
  \ table, every chair, every bunk - every piece has to be in the right place. Barricades, fallback\
  \ positions, places to hide. He learned the hard way that when an ambush comes, your surroundings\
  \ matter. If his lance thinks he's obsessive, that's fine - one day, it might save their lives.
FURNITURE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry is incapable of leaving a room alone. The storage crates?\
  \ Better flow if they're stacked this way. The command center? Desks should be closer for\
  \ efficiency. The mess hall? Obviously, tables need to be rotated 45 degrees for maximum comfort.\
  \ The crew walks in every morning never knowing what new layout Barry has cooked up.
FURNITURE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry can't stop tweaking the company's base layout. "This would\
  \ be way more functional if the tool racks were over there." "Why is the coffee machine so far\
  \ from the main entry?" It doesn't matter if it's a barracks, a mobile command center, or a\
  \ DropShip cargo hold - Barry will optimize it, even if it means driving everyone insane.
FURNITURE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry moves furniture, gear, everything - not because it matters,\
  \ but because it's something he can change. He can't control which contracts they take, who lives\
  \ or dies, or when the next battle will come. But he can control where the damn chairs go. And\
  \ some days, that's the only thing keeping him from losing his mind.

GLASSES.label=Constantly Adjusts Glasses
GLASSES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just push up his glasses - he does it while scanning\
  \ enemy formations, calculating range corrections, or muttering about heat efficiency. His squad\
  \ has learned that when he adjusts them twice in a row, he's about to say something really\
  \ important. If he takes them off, it's already too late.
GLASSES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry looks like he should be in a research lab, not a battlefield.\
  \ His glasses are always slipping down his nose, his HUD is constantly recalibrating for glare,\
  \ and he's the only one who checks a damage report before checking his own injuries. And yet,\
  \ somehow, he never misses a shot.
GLASSES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry pushes up his glasses like it'll make the world clearer, like\
  \ it'll help him understand why he's still alive when so many aren't. He sees every mistake,\
  \ every miscalculation, every doomed maneuver before it happens - but no one ever listens in time.\
  \ He keeps adjusting his glasses, keeps trying to see better - but it doesn't change a damn thing.
GLASSES.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's glasses are always slipping because he's always\
  \ reading - contract clauses, supply manifests, tech manuals in languages he doesn't actually\
  \ speak. If there's a scam in a deal, he'll find it. If there's a loophole in a contract, he'll\
  \ close it. His glasses may be old, scratched, and constantly need an adjustment, but they\
  \ never miss a detail.
GLASSES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry adjusts his glasses so often that people have started using it\
  \ as a warning sign. If he's doing it absentmindedly while scribbling notes, he's solving a\
  \ problem. If he does it sharply while reading, he's just found something terrible. If he\
  \ adjusts them three times in a row? Someone messed up big time.
GLASSES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry adjusts his glasses as he scans death tolls, burned-out\
  \ accounts, the slow collapse of everything. He keeps records, because someone has to. He keeps\
  \ reading, because ignorance won't save them. He keeps adjusting his glasses, because the numbers\
  \ never get any better.

GLOVES.label=Always Wearing Gloves
GLOVES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry insists that good grip is everything. Whether he's scoffing\
  \ down an MRE, cleaning his sidearm, or attending a mandatory training meeting, his gloves are\
  \ always on. He claims they improve performance, reduce wear on his hands, and help keep sweat\
  \ from ruining his trigger control. His squad thinks he's being excessive - until their own hands\
  \ are blistered and bruised while his are perfectly fine.
GLOVES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry is always wearing gloves, no exceptions. No one has ever seen\
  \ him take them off - not to eat, not to fix his gear, not even to shake hands. Some assume it's\
  \ habit, others think it's superstition. The truth? Barry won't say, and no one has the nerve to\
  \ ask.
GLOVES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's gloves aren't just habit - they're armor. Beneath them, his\
  \ hands tell stories no one else is allowed to read - burns from an engine explosion, deep scars\
  \ from a knife fight, skin that's never fully healed from exposure to toxic rain. He covers them\
  \ up because if he doesn't, he'll have to explain. And he doesn't want to remember.
GLOVES.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry handles supply crates, repair tools, and even paperwork with\
  \ gloved hands. "You do not want to know how dirty these surfaces are," he insists while\
  \ disinfecting a shipment manifest. The tech crews roll their eyes, but when they see what\
  \ actually grows inside a poorly maintained coolant line, they start wondering if he's got a\
  \ point.
GLOVES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry cycles through different gloves for different jobs. No matter\
  \ the occasion, he always has the right pair ready. At this point, it's just part of who he is.
GLOVES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry wears gloves because he remembers. The first time he felt warm\
  \ blood seep through his fingers, the first time he held a dying friend's hand, the first time he\
  \ had to scrub his own hands raw to get rid of a stain that never really went away. He wears\
  \ gloves now, not to protect himself, but to pretend that some things never happened.

HAND_GESTURES.label=Excessive Hand Gestures
HAND_GESTURES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just call out targets - he illustrates them with\
  \ wild gestures. He points, waves, and practically mimes his battle strategies. His lance jokes\
  \ that if his radio ever goes down, he could probably still direct an entire skirmish just with\
  \ hand signals and exaggerated shrugs.
HAND_GESTURES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry can't give a briefing, tell a story, or even trash-talk\
  \ an enemy without animated, sweeping gestures. He's nearly smacked his own teammates more than\
  \ once while explaining a maneuver mid-battle. He fights just as expressively - every reload, every\
  \ charge, every headshot somehow feels like it belongs in an action holo.
HAND_GESTURES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's hands never stop moving - because if they do, he might\
  \ remember. Remember the times he couldn't signal for help, when orders were lost in the chaos,\
  \ when a simple gesture could've saved someone but didn't come in time. He talks with his hands\
  \ because the alternative is letting them be still - and stillness brings nothing but ghosts.
HAND_GESTURES.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just explain supply chain issues - he acts them\
  \ out. A shipment delay? He throws his hands skyward in exasperation. Budget cuts? He pantomimes\
  \ a knife slitting a throat. The crew half-listens to his actual words, but they always get the\
  \ message thanks to his theatrics.
HAND_GESTURES.description.1.SUPPORT="Go left - no, left-left - okay, look, just follow my hand."\
  \ Barry's gesturing is so wild and exaggerated that sometimes people understand him less, not\
  \ more. His coworkers have learned to watch the gestures first and listen second.
HAND_GESTURES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's hands move constantly, tracing out stories, shaping\
  \ invisible diagrams, gesturing through explanations. But there's something in the way he\
  \ hesitates, like he's trying to use them for something else, something other than what they\
  \ were made for - pulling triggers, closing airlocks, writing names on casualty reports. The\
  \ motions keep the past at bay. Barely.

HAND_WRINGER.label=Compulsive Hand-Wringer
HAND_WRINGER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry wrings his hands while waiting for battle to start,\
  \ during mission briefings, even mid-firefight. He sees every possible way things could go wrong\
  \ and can't help but fret over them. His lance jokes that if he ever stops rubbing his hands\
  \ together, that's when they should start panicking.
HAND_WRINGER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry double-checks his weapons, reviews the mission plan\
  \ again, and adjusts his gear obsessively - but no matter how prepared he is, his hands keep\
  \ twisting together, like he's waiting for some unseen disaster. The second the bullets start\
  \ flying, though, the hand-wringing stops - because once the battle begins, there's no time left to\
  \ worry.
HAND_WRINGER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry wrings his hands because they remember. They remember\
  \ every mission gone wrong, every time he hesitated, every comrade he couldn't save. His fingers\
  \ trace scars, phantom pains from injuries long healed, from choices that never will. The war\
  \ might not have killed him yet, but it's taken pieces of him - one nervous motion at a time.
HAND_WRINGER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry isn't just responsible for his team - he's responsible for\
  \ people. Every time he hands out rations, ammo, or medical kits, his hands twist together like\
  \ he's wondering if it's enough. He knows the numbers, but knowing doesn't make it easier when he\
  \ has to tell someone there's nothing left to give.
HAND_WRINGER.description.1.SUPPORT=It doesn't matter if it's a million-C-bill contract or a coffee\
  \ order, Barry agonizes over every decision. His hands wring as he debates between fuel\
  \ allocations, payment schedules, or whether he should requisition one more crate of emergency\
  \ rations. "What if we need it later?" is his constant refrain, and no amount of reassurance\
  \ stops the fidgeting.
HAND_WRINGER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry wrings his hands not just in nervousness, but in guilt.\
  \ He's the one who signs the orders. The one who makes the calculations - who lives, who fights,\
  \ who doesn't come back. The numbers say he's making the right calls, but his hands still shake\
  \ every time he stamps approval on a contract that sends people to their deaths.

HANDSHAKE.label=Overly Enthusiastic Handshake
HANDSHAKE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just shake hands - he grips with both hands, shakes\
  \ firmly, and holds on just a little too long. "Good to meet you, friend! We're going to do great\
  \ things together!" His enthusiasm is infectious, but some recruits worry they've just signed an\
  \ unspoken blood pact with him.
HANDSHAKE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry seals deals, alliances, and battle plans with a handshake\
  \ that could crush a lesser man's fingers. "Damn good to have you on board!" he booms, nearly\
  \ dislocating the arm of a junior officer. It's less a greeting and more an event, and somehow,\
  \ it actually makes people believe in him.
HANDSHAKE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry grips hands like he's afraid to let go, like he's holding\
  \ onto something real in a universe where people vanish in an instant. His squad has seen it\
  \ before - he shakes hands like it might be the last time. And too often, it is.
HANDSHAKE.description.0.SUPPORT="Welcome to the chaos!" Barry grins as he shakes a MechWarriors's\
  \ hand so hard their whole torso moves. "Need anything? Ammo, armor, a replacement heat sink? You\
  \ just say the word!" No one can ever claim Barry lacks customer service skills... if they can\
  \ still feel their fingers afterward.
HANDSHAKE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's handshake is a statement, even when it really shouldn't\
  \ be. Meeting a high-ranking officer? He pumps their hand like they're old drinking buddies.\
  \ Signing a delicate negotiation? He shakes so hard it nearly knocks over the paperwork. Everyone\
  \ remembers meeting Barry - if only because their wrist hurts afterward.
HANDSHAKE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's handshakes are too firm, too eager, too desperate. Like\
  \ he's making sure you know you exist, that you're real, that you're still here. Because the\
  \ last time he let someone go without a proper handshake, they walked into a battle they didn't\
  \ walk out of. And he's been making up for it ever since.

HEADPHONES.label=Always Wearing Headphones
HEADPHONES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just go into battle - he does it with a playlist.\
  \ Whether it's heavy metal, modern symphonies, or classical rock, he swears the right song\
  \ keeps him in the zone. His squad is used to seeing him nodding along mid-firefight, completely\
  \ unfazed by the chaos around him.
HEADPHONES.description.1.COMBATANT=Whether he's about to drop, in the repair bay, or riding in a\
  \ DropShip, Barry always has his headphones on. Always. No one knows what he's listening to, but\
  \ they're pretty sure he's ignoring everything else - until it's time to fight. Then, suddenly,\
  \ he's hyper-focused, like the world just synced to his personal rhythm.
HEADPHONES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't listen to music because he enjoys it. He listens\
  \ because if he doesn't, the silence creeps in - the echoes of artillery, the screams over comms,\
  \ the last words of people who didn't make it. The headphones aren't just habit. They're\
  \ survival.
HEADPHONES.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry works like he's conducting an orchestra. No one knows\
  \ exactly what he's listening to, but if his head starts bobbing, it means things are getting\
  \\ done.
HEADPHONES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's headphones are a barrier. People argue? He doesn't hear\
  \ it. Commanders complain about budgets? Not his problem. Someone waves frantically for his\
  \ attention? He sighs, reluctantly pulls off one earpiece, and mutters, "This better be\
  \ important."
HEADPHONES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry keeps his headphones on because music is the only thing\
  \ that still feels safe. He's seen planets burn, heard the real sounds of war. If he keeps the\
  \ music playing, maybe - just maybe - he can pretend, for a little while, that the universe isn't\
  \ completely falling apart.

HEALTHY_SNACKS.label=Frequently Snacking on Healthy Foods
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry treats combat like a sport, and fueling his body is part\
  \ of his routine. He's always chewing on protein bars, popping dried fruit between drills, and\
  \ downing electrolyte drinks like they're going out of style. His squad teases him, but they\
  \ don't complain when he hands out energy-packed snacks that keep them going during long\
  \ deployments.
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry believes in balance. One moment he's unloading an\
  \ autocannon into an enemy vehicle, the next he's peeling an orange and offering vitamin-packed\
  \ snacks to the team. "Hydration's key to peak combat performance," he says, handing a bottle of\
  \ electrolyte water to a comrade who's still shaking from adrenaline.
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't eat healthy because he's a fitness nut - he does it\
  \ because he knows what it's like to have nothing. To go days without food, to feel his body\
  \ weaken, to fight while running on empty. He stocks up, he preps, he controls his intake - because\
  \ the day will come when the food runs out again. And this time, he'll be ready.
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry believes a well-fed crew is a functional crew. He stocks\
  \ supply depots with the best ration options, pushes fresh produce when he can get it, and\
  \ constantly reminds people to eat real meals. If you need a snack, he's already got one on\
  \ hand - just don't ask for junk food.
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry is that guy - the one replacing coffee with herbal tea,\
  \ swapping ration packs for high-protein alternatives, and lecturing the unit about eating real\
  \ food instead of surviving on caffeine and spite. It's well-meaning... but after the third speech\
  \ about micronutrients, people start hiding their snacks from him.
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry stockpiles food, not out of paranoia, but because he\
  \ remembers. The hunger, the desperation, the slow, creeping weakness of not having enough. Even\
  \ in times of plenty, he stashes protein bars, dried fruit, anything that will last - because he\
  \ knows the moment will come when the company is cut off, and when it does, he won't be the one\
  \ caught starving again.

HISTORIAN.label=Passionate about History
HISTORIAN.description.0.COMBATANT=Every skirmish, every engagement, every ambush reminds him of a\
  \ past war. "This is just like the Hesperus II siege, different scale, same mistakes," he\
  \ mutters, adjusting his sights. His lance has learned that whenever he starts recounting\
  \ military history mid-firefight, it's either a sign of his confidence - or a really bad omen.
HISTORIAN.description.1.COMBATANT=Tactical formations, famous last stands, the lineage of a\
  \ particular mercenary unit - he can recall all of it. One moment he's breaking down the enemy's\
  \ battle doctrine, the next he's casually mentioning that their insignia has roots in some\
  \ obscure rebellion from 2434. Most of his comrades don't mind - unless they're trying to focus on\
  \ not dying.
HISTORIAN.description.2.COMBATANT=Wars don't change, only the names and weapons do. Barry has\
  \ studied enough conflicts to know how units rise and fall, how every so-called unstoppable force\
  \ eventually collapses. His knowledge isn't inspiring - it's a weight. He fights anyway, not\
  \ because he thinks this time will be different, but because he's got no other choice.
HISTORIAN.description.0.SUPPORT=A simple request for replacement heat sinks can turn into a\
  \ twenty-minute lesson on old Terran engineering. Reviewing supply routes? Expect a tangent about\
  \ the logistical failures of the Rim War. Most of the company just nods along, secretly hoping\
  \ they'll retain at least one useful piece of trivia.
HISTORIAN.description.1.SUPPORT=Somewhere in his personal storage are old reports, battlefield\
  \ maps, declassified documents, and a collection of holobooks that would make a historian\
  \ jealous. If a mercenary unit ever existed, he probably knows about it. If a planet ever hosted\
  \ a battle, he has the details. The trick isn't finding information - it's escaping before he tells\
  \ the entire backstory.
HISTORIAN.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just study the famous battles - he memorizes the\
  \ names of those no one remembers. The soldiers whose units were wiped out, the mercenary\
  \ companies that vanished, the colonies erased by war and never rebuilt. He collects their\
  \ stories because no one else will. Because one day, someone will have to do the same for him.

HUMMER.label=Habitual Hummer
HUMMER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry is always humming - sometimes a marching cadence, sometimes\
  \ an old bar song, sometimes a melody no one else recognizes. It's not loud, just a quiet hum\
  \ over comms while he lines up a shot or waits for the next engagement. His lance jokes that if\
  \ he ever stops humming, that's when things have really gone bad.
HUMMER.description.1.COMBATANT=In the middle of a firefight, with missiles flying and alarms\
  \ blaring, Barry is still humming. He does it when charging, when bracing for impact, even while\
  \ dodging incoming fire. Some say it helps him focus. Others think he's just a little too\
  \ comfortable in the chaos. Either way, the tune never stops - until the shooting does.
HUMMER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry hums to fill the silence where voices used to be. The\
  \ comrades who didn't make it back, the allies lost on distant battlefields, the old commanders\
  \ who once barked orders over the radio. If he hums loud enough, maybe he won't have to hear\
  \ their ghosts whispering back.
HUMMER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry hums as he takes inventory, hums while filling out\
  \ manifests, hums while rerouting cargo through bureaucratic nightmares. The tech crew has long\
  \ since accepted that the low hum of an old war tune or a jaunty little ditty means Barry is\
  \ nearby - usually with a clipboard and a sarcastic comment.
HUMMER.description.1.SUPPORT=No matter where he is, Barry is always humming something. It's\
  \ never the same tune twice, and it's always just loud enough to be noticed. Whether he's\
  \ reviewing documents or walking through the barracks, his ever-present melody has become as much\
  \ a part of the company as the sound of Mech repairs in the hangar.
HUMMER.description.2.SUPPORT=The company has lost a lot - good pilots, steady contracts, entire\
  \ DropShips full of people who never made it back. Barry hums because silence is worse. Silence\
  \ means another mission failure. Silence means another name wiped off the roster. Silence means\
  \ they're next. If he keeps humming, keeps making some kind of noise, maybe they're not done yet.

HYGIENIC.label=Obsessed with Hygiene
HYGIENIC.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry keeps his gear spotless, his weapons polished, and his\
  \ bunk smelling shockingly fresh. No matter how bad the battlefield gets, he finds time to wipe\
  \ down his visor and disinfect his gloves. His lance laughs, but when their weapons jam from dust\
  \ buildup and his fires clean, they start to reconsider.
HYGIENIC.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry refuses to drink from shared canteens, avoids touching\
  \ anything that hasn't been sanitized, and definitely has a stash of antiseptic wipes in every\
  \ pocket. "You think the enemy is the real threat?" he scoffs. "Try an untreated infection in the\
  \ middle of a contract." They joke that he's over the top - until half the squad goes down with\
  \ trench fever, and Barry's the only one still standing.
HYGIENIC.description.2.COMBATANT=No amount of scrubbing can wash the blood from his hands. Barry\
  \ showers until his skin is raw, sterilizes his gear twice before every battle, and wipes down\
  \ every surface he touches. He tells himself it's just habit, but deep down, he knows - no matter\
  \ how hard he tries, some stains never come out.
HYGIENIC.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry keeps his workspace pristine. Every surface is dusted,\
  \ every tool is disinfected, and no one touches the inventory without wearing gloves. "Clean\
  \ workspace, clean workflow," he mutters, wiping down a perfectly spotless terminal. The techs\
  \ roll their eyes, but deep down, they appreciate not having to work in filth.
HYGIENIC.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has a very firm stance on personal cleanliness. Boots off\
  \ before entering the barracks, no eating near the control consoles, and absolutely no sneezing\
  \ without covering your mouth. If he had it his way, every MechWarrior would get decontaminated\
  \ before stepping into a cockpit. The commander refuses to humor him - but Barry still sprays down\
  \ every chair with disinfectant when no one's looking.
HYGIENIC.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry can't stop the war. He can't stop the deaths, the\
  \ betrayals, the slow rot of another unit heading toward ruin. But he can keep his workspace\
  \ clean. He can scrub the blood from the floors. He can make sure that, if nothing else, his\
  \ hands don't feel dirty - even when the rest of him does.

IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.label=Unusual Sleep Patterns
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't follow a normal sleep cycle - he sleeps when the\
  \ war lets him. A 15-minute nap in a cockpit? Good enough. Two hours slumped against a crate\
  \ between missions? That'll do. His squad wonders how he functions, but when the fighting starts,\
  \ he's always ready, no matter when he last closed his eyes.
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust sleep, not completely. He's the one pacing\
  \ the perimeter at odd hours, tinkering with his gear at 0300, sipping coffee while watching the\
  \ horizon. "Somebody's gotta keep an eye on things," he says, adjusting his harness. The truth?\
  \ He sleeps best when he knows someone else is standing watch - but he never quite trusts anyone\
  \ enough to let himself drift off.
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't sleep like normal people because his body\
  \ remembers too much. Every time he closes his eyes, his mind replays firefights he barely\
  \ survived, comrades he couldn't save, the slow-motion collapse of a battle gone wrong. He stays\
  \ awake as long as possible, dreading the moment exhaustion forces him to relive it all.
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry sleeps in shifts that make no sense to anyone else - two\
  \ hours here, a nap there, then somehow a full eight hours in the middle of a work cycle. No one\
  \ knows how he keeps things running on such an erratic schedule, but somehow, the work is still\
  \ finished on time.
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry treats sleep like an inconvenience. There's always another\
  \ report to file, another order to review, another detail to double-check. "I'll sleep when\
  \ things slow down," he says - but things never slow down. His coworkers have started making bets\
  \ on when he'll finally pass out at his desk.
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.2.SUPPORT=Sleep isn't rest - it's vulnerability. It's time lost, moments he\
  \ can't control, a gap in awareness where something can go wrong. Barry puts it off, fights it,\
  \ drinks stimulant-laced tea just to keep going a little longer. He tells himself it's about\
  \ efficiency, but deep down, he knows - when he finally crashes, he might not want to wake up\
  \ again.

JOKER.label=Fond of Puns
JOKER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry cracks puns even in the heat of battle. "Looks like that\
  \ guy's having a meltdown," he quips after overheating an enemy Mech. His squad groans at his\
  \ constant wordplay, but they can't deny it lightens the tension - just enough to keep them steady\
  \ when the situation turns grim.
JOKER.description.1.COMBATANT=Whether it's a firefight, a stealth op, or a tense briefing,\
  \ Barry finds time for a pun. "Guess you could say we really blasted through that ambush," he\
  \ says with a grin, wiping soot off his armor. His squad has stopped trying to stop him - it's\
  \ better to let him get it out of his system and keep moving.
JOKER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's puns aren't just for fun - they're armor. Every terrible\
  \ joke, every groan-worthy pun is a way to push back against the constant dread of war. "We may\
  \ be fighting uphill, but at least we've got a peak advantage," he says with a wink. But behind\
  \ the grin, there's a weariness he'll never put into words.
JOKER.description.0.SUPPORT=Whatever Barry is doing, there's always a pun involved. His\
  \ colleagues roll their eyes, but even the most jaded warrior cracks a smile now and then.
JOKER.description.1.SUPPORT=The war never stops, the work never ends, but Barry finds a way\
  \ to make it just a little less awful. He sticks pun-laden sticky notes on schedules, makes\
  \ groan-worthy jokes during routine maintenance, and ensures no report leaves his desk without at\
  \ least one bad pun. No one likes it - but no one really wants him to stop, either.
JOKER.description.2.SUPPORT=Every pun is forced, every joke just a little too loud. Barry\
  \ keeps the wordplay coming because if he stops, he'll have to face the reality of what he's\
  \ dealing with - the broken machines, the wounded soldiers, the paperwork documenting another\
  \ casualty instead of another paycheck. "Looks like someone's having a rough day," he says,\
  \ filling out another death report. The laugh that follows is just a little too hollow.

LISTS.label=Compulsive List Maker
LISTS.description.0.COMBATANT=Before every mission, Barry has a list - objectives, fallback\
  \ positions, enemy strengths, even a checklist of which comrades owe him money from last week's\
  \ poker game. He swears by his method, and given how rarely he's caught off guard, his team is\
  \ starting to believe he's onto something.
LISTS.description.1.COMBATANT=Every battle, every skirmish, every firefight has a plan. Barry\
  \ keeps a running list in his HUD - priority targets, terrain advantages, escape routes. "War is\
  \ just a series of problems to solve," he says, adding a mental checkmark as he takes down\
  \ another enemy.
LISTS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry knows war is a mess - he's seen friends die, missions\
  \ collapse, and too many unpredictable variables. So he makes lists. Lists of enemies confirmed\
  \ dead. Lists of the wounded. Lists of names he never wants to forget. It doesn't stop the chaos,\
  \ but at least on paper, it looks like something is under control.
LISTS.description.0.SUPPORT=It doesn't matter what he's doing - Barry has a list for it. Daily\
  \ tasks? Listed. Emergency protocols? Color-coded and categorized. Someone asks him about\
  \ inventory? He flips through his secondary list to cross-reference the real list. No one knows\
  \ how he keeps track of so much, but without him, the whole operation would grind to a halt.
LISTS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't trust memory - he trusts lists. Schedules, ration\
  \ allocations, critical injuries - if it matters, it's on a datapad or scribbled onto a notepad he\
  \ refuses to lose. "If it's not written down, it didn't happen," he says, making another\
  \ annotation that absolutely didn't need to be recorded but will come in handy later.
LISTS.description.2.SUPPORT=The lists are getting longer. More damaged equipment, more\
  \ unpaid wages, more missing personnel. Barry doesn't just track resources - he tracks the decline.\
  \ Every name marked "deceased," every supply line lost, every payment delayed. He doesn't talk\
  \ about it, but in the quiet hours, he flips through his notes, wondering when he'll have to add\
  \ himself to the final list.

LITERAL.label=Overly Literal
LITERAL.description.0.COMBATANT="Cover me!" Barry's lance shouts, diving for cover. Barry,\
  \ standing still, replies, "Cover you with what? Suppressive fire? Smoke? A tarp?" While his unit\
  \ groans, he's already assessing precisely what they need - because in battle, clarity matters.
LITERAL.description.1.COMBATANT="Take out that tank!" Barry pauses. "Do you mean destroy the\
  \ tank, or just disable it? Are we capturing it? Are we worried about collateral damage?" By the\
  \ time he gets his answers, the squad has already moved - but at least he never misinterprets a\
  \ command.
LITERAL.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't use euphemisms. He doesn't talk about\
  \ "eliminating hostiles" or "neutralizing threats." He calls it what it is - killing. He's seen too\
  \ many people hide behind vague language, pretending it makes war cleaner. He refuses. War isn't\
  \ clean. And he won't pretend otherwise
LITERAL.description.0.SUPPORT="Barry, patch up that report." He grabs a literal patch kit.\
  \ "Barry, hand me that tool." He places it directly in someone's palm. "Barry, fix this system\
  \ real quick." "Define quick," he responds, already pulling out a diagnostic report. He's not\
  \ trying to be difficult - he just needs precision.
LITERAL.description.1.SUPPORT=If a contract says "supplies will be provided as available,"\
  \ Barry will absolutely demand clarification on what "available" means. If a report says\
  \ someone was "lost in action," he will not accept it unless he gets clear details. It makes\
  \ negotiations painful - but it also prevents a lot of costly mistakes.
LITERAL.description.2.SUPPORT="How's the company holding up, Barry?" someone asks. He doesn't\
  \ sugarcoat it. "We've lost 32% of our working Mechs, supply reserves are critical, and we're\
  \ two payroll cycles from insolvency." No one ever wants to hear his reports, but Barry won't\
  \ lie, won't soften the truth. Because in a world where everyone tries to mask the inevitable,\
  \ someone has to face it head-on.

LOCKS.label=Checks Locks Repeatedly
LOCKS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry double-checks every hatch, seal, and weapons locker\
  \ before and after deployment. "If you assume something's secure, that's when it isn't," he\
  \ mutters, tugging at a latch one more time. His squad jokes that he'd probably check the\
  \ airlock itself if they let him - but no one complains when his obsessive habits keep them alive.
LOCKS.description.1.COMBATANT=It doesn't matter if they're bunked down in a secure zone or\
  \ camping in enemy territory - Barry will always check every entrance, every lock, every secured\
  \ weapon. "You laugh now," he says, rattling the latch again, "but the one time I don't do this,\
  \ we'll get jumped in our sleep."
LOCKS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry used to trust that locked doors stayed locked. He doesn't\
  \ anymore. He remembers the time a door didn't seal, the time an enemy slipped through unsecured\
  \ defenses, the time someone he was supposed to protect didn't make it. Now, he checks every\
  \ lock, every latch, every seal - because if something does go wrong, at least he'll know it wasn't\
  \ his fault this time.
LOCKS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry runs things like a fortress. If a locker is supposed to be\
  \ locked, he'll verify it three times. If a storage bay has security codes, he personally resets\
  \ them. No one gets unauthorized access on his watch - partially because he's paranoid, and\
  \ partially because he really enjoys telling people no.
LOCKS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry always double-checks the locks. If someone says a door is\
  \ sealed, he'll check anyway. If someone insists an override is definitely disabled, he'll still\
  \ run his test. It's not personal - he just knows better than to trust assumptions.
LOCKS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry locks things because he knows what happens when you don't.\
  \ He's seen desperate refugees raid supply caches, saboteurs slip into barracks, doors that\
  \ should have held shattered when it mattered most. He can't control the war, the contracts, the\
  \ inevitable losses - but he can make sure that, for now, the doors stay locked.

MEASURED_TALKER.label=Tends to Speak in a Measured Pace
MEASURED_TALKER.description.0.COMBATANT=No matter how intense the battle gets, Barry's voice never\
  \ wavers. He delivers orders with the slow, deliberate cadence of someone who refuses to be\
  \ rushed. "Adjust... thirty meters left... fire." His squad swears that hearing him on comms is\
  \ almost calming - until they realize that if Barry's still speaking that way, things must be even\
  \ worse than they thought.
MEASURED_TALKER.description.1.COMBATANT=While others shout over each other, Barry waits. He listens,\
  \ thinks, then speaks carefully. "We engage now, we overextend. We wait ten seconds, we flank."\
  \ He refuses to let adrenaline dictate his decisions, and while it frustrates more aggressive\
  \ warriors, his squad has learned to trust him.
MEASURED_TALKER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry used to talk faster, used to joke, used to care more.\
  \ Now, every word is deliberate, like he's trying not to waste them. He's seen too many people\
  \ speak their last words before they even knew they'd die. So now, he speaks like he's making\
  \ sure every sentence matters. Because someday, he won't get another one.
MEASURED_TALKER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry talks like he's drafting a contract in real time. Whether\
  \ it's discussing orders, timelines, or options, every word is deliberate, precise. No one ever\
  \ walks away confused - but they do sometimes walk away wondering if they just got outmaneuvered in\
  \ a simple conversation.
MEASURED_TALKER.description.1.SUPPORT=When Barry explains a process, he does it slowly, clearly, and\
  \ with no room for misunderstanding. "You will disconnect the relay. You will not touch the\
  \ exposed wiring. If you do, you will absolutely die." Whether he's training rookies or giving\
  \ mission updates, his methodical speech ensures that no one can claim they didn't hear him.
MEASURED_TALKER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't raise his voice, doesn't rush his words, doesn't\
  \ waste breath. He speaks with the weight of someone who has already delivered bad news too many\
  \ times. When he tells a soldier, "You'll be fine," they believe him. When he says, "There's\
  \ nothing more I can do," they know he's already tried everything.

MINIMALIST.label=Extreme Minimalism
MINIMALIST.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's kit is stripped down to the absolute essentials - no\
  \ extra ammo, no backup gear, no sentimental keepsakes. "More weight slows you down," he says,\
  \ tightening the one pouch he allows himself. His lance teases him for it, but when they're\
  \ struggling under overstuffed packs and he's still moving, they start to reconsider.
MINIMALIST.description.1.COMBATANT=No unnecessary attachments, no redundant weapons, no fancy\
  \ tech. Barry keeps his loadout simple - because simple works. "You don't need a dozen backup\
  \ plans," he says, securing his sidearm. "You need one that won't fail." It's an efficient\
  \ mindset, but some worry it's less about discipline and more about not wanting to get attached\
  \ to anything.
MINIMALIST.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry owns nothing he wouldn't be willing to leave behind. No\
  \ personal items, no extra gear, no home to return to. He fights with what he carries, and if he\
  \ has to abandon it tomorrow, he will. Because war takes everything eventually - better to live\
  \ like you've already lost it all.
MINIMALIST.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in excess. Everything in his workspace is\
  \ accounted for and necessary. If it's not useful, it's gone. "Extra gear is just dead weight,"\
  \ he mutters, denying yet another request for nonessential items. Efficiency isn't just a\
  \ goal - it's the rule.
MINIMALIST.description.1.SUPPORT=No unnecessary tasks, no excessive reports, no overcomplicated\
  \ solutions. Barry patches what needs patching, nothing extra. "Good enough is good enough," he\
  \ says, stepping back from another just-functional-enough fix. It keeps things running - but some\
  \ worry that one day, his definition of 'good enough' won't be enough.
MINIMALIST.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just live simply - he removes everything that\
  \ doesn't serve a purpose. Personal items? A distraction. Extra gear? Just something to lose.\
  \ Relationships? Harder to let go of than supplies, but just as fleeting. If he only keeps what's\
  \ necessary, maybe it won't hurt so much when it all falls apart.

MUG.label=Prefers Using a Specific Mug
MUG.description.0.COMBATANT=Before every mission, Barry drinks from his mug. Doesn't matter\
  \ if it's coffee, tea, or a protein shake - it only counts if it's in the same battered, slightly\
  \ dented, and thoroughly stained cup. His squad doesn't question it. Given how many battles he's\
  \ survived, they figure it might actually be lucky.
MUG.description.1.COMBATANT="The shape keeps the liquid at the optimal temperature," Barry\
  \ insists, sipping from his one and only mug. "The handle has perfect weight distribution." He\
  \ refuses to use any other cup, even if it means rinsing it out in battlefield runoff before\
  \ pouring another drink. His squad has long since accepted that the mug goes where he goes.
MUG.description.2.COMBATANT=The mug has been with him longer than most of his comrades.\
  \ He's left planets behind, lost equipment, abandoned people - but this remains. Barry doesn't\
  \ talk about where he got it or why he won't replace it. He just holds it a little tighter on the\
  \ nights when the war feels particularly close.
MUG.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry keeps things running like clockwork, but if anyone so much\
  \ as touches his mug, they're in for a lecture. "You want coffee? Fine. You don't use this mug."\
  \ He's signed off on impossible job lists without blinking, but the day someone borrowed his mug?\
  \ That was a crisis.
MUG.description.1.SUPPORT=There could be an emergency, a full company deployment, a\
  \ reactor on fire - but Barry will not start work without drinking from his one mug. "Things\
  \ function better with consistency," he says, taking another sip. The fact that he talks about\
  \ his mug the same way he talks about people is concerning.
MUG.description.2.SUPPORT=The bunk, the uniform, the gear - it all belongs to the company.\
  \ It all changes with every contract, every deployment. But the mug? The mug is his. The one\
  \ thing that hasn't been replaced, reassigned, or lost to war. If he ever loses it, he's not sure\
  \ what will be left of him.

NAIL_BITER.label=Constant Nail Biter
NAIL_BITER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't flinch under fire, doesn't panic when missiles\
  \ rain down - but his fingers tell a different story. His nails are jagged, bitten down to near\
  \ nothing, the casualty of endless waiting, briefing delays, and long hours in the scrum. It's\
  \ not fear, he insists. Just something to do while the next battle looms.
NAIL_BITER.description.1.COMBATANT=Mid-firefight, mid-strategy meeting, mid-conversation - Barry's\
  \ fingers are always near his mouth, absentmindedly gnawed as he thinks. "Barry, stop biting your\
  \ damn nails," someone mutters over comms. A second of silence, then: "Huh? Oh. Right." It lasts\
  \ maybe five minutes before he starts again.
NAIL_BITER.description.2.COMBATANT=His hands shake after missions, so he bites his nails. It gives\
  \ him something to focus on, something small to control when everything else spirals beyond his\
  \ grasp. If his fingers are raw, if his nails are ruined - well, at least it's proof he's still\
  \ here. At least it's his own damage, not someone else's.
NAIL_BITER.description.0.SUPPORT=His job is a battlefield of its own, and Barry feels every\
  \ engagement. Inventory shortages, delayed shipments, missing tools - each issue gets a little more\
  \ nail chewed away. "We're short on fusion coolant again?" he mutters, biting the edge of his\
  \ thumbnail. If he had an intact fingernail left, it would be a miracle.
NAIL_BITER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry works fast, his brain running just ahead of his hands, his\
  \ teeth worrying at his nails between quick repairs. "Hold still, almost done - just let me - "\
  \ crunch. The nervous habit doesn't slow him down, but his tools are often slick with antiseptic\
  \ from another self-inflicted cut.
NAIL_BITER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't talk about his stress. He doesn't lash out,\
  \ doesn't break things, doesn't complain. Instead, his nails are bitten down to raw, torn messes,\
  \ silent proof of the pressure grinding him down. It's the only thing he allows himself - the only\
  \ wound he's willing to show.

NICKNAMING.label=Frequent Nicknaming
NICKNAMING.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry almost never calls his teammates by their actual names.\
  \ The rookie pilot? 'Hotshot.' The team's allocated tech? 'Sparky.' The commander? 'Big Boss.'\
  \ Half the unit has stopped correcting him, because by the time they do, he's already come up\
  \ with another one.
NICKNAMING.description.1.COMBATANT="Alright, Thunderfist, you take point. Stickbug, you cover the\
  \ left flank. Princess, you - " "Barry, I swear to god, stop calling me that." But Barry doesn't\
  \ stop. Ever. Once he's assigned a nickname, it sticks. If you don't like it? Too bad. That just\
  \ makes him say it more.
NICKNAMING.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry hands out nicknames like candy. It's easier than\
  \ remembering real names - because real names come with memories. With losses. With faces he'd\
  \ rather not picture when he tries to sleep. As long as they're 'Razor' or 'Gunsmoke' or\
  \ 'Scrappy', he doesn't have to think about how many real names he's already had to cross out.
NICKNAMING.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in titles. The lead mechanic is 'Grease,'\
  \ the MedTech is 'Patches,' and the newest recruit is 'Fresh Meat' until they earn something\
  \ better. It's all part of the company's culture now - at this point, even he probably doesn't\
  \ remember their real names.
NICKNAMING.description.1.SUPPORT=Everyone who works with Barry gets a nickname, and once he\
  \ assigns one, it's yours for life. The problem? They don't always make sense. "Hey, 'Wires,'\
  \ pass me that wrench." "Barry, I'm not an electrician." "Don't argue with me, Wires." The\
  \ name sticks. It always sticks.
NICKNAMING.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry gives out names because it means someone sees you.\
  \ Military units burn through people fast - soldiers, techs, medics, clerks. Most of them get a\
  \ number on a payroll log and little else. But if Barry calls you 'Chief' or 'Rookie' or\
  \ 'Grimlock,' it means you existed. Even if only for a little while.

NIGHT_OWL.label=Night Owl
NIGHT_OWL.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry is at his best when the sun's down. While the rest of the\
  \ squad struggles through late-night operations, he's fully alert, reacting faster, making\
  \ sharper calls. "Midnight raids, night drops, stealth ops? That's my time to shine," he says,\
  \ adjusting his visor. Some wonder if he even sleeps - or if he just waits for daylight to pass.
NIGHT_OWL.description.1.COMBATANT=While the squad sleeps, Barry patrols, cleans his gear, and\
  \ tunes his HUD. "Somebody's gotta be awake," he says, sipping yet another cup of bitter coffee.\
  \ He insists it's not paranoia - he just prefers the quiet, the way the battlefield feels different\
  \ under starlight.
NIGHT_OWL.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry stays up not because he wants to, but because sleep\
  \ brings things he doesn't want to see. Memories of burning cities, last words over broken comms,\
  \ the slow count of names he's lost. The night is quiet. And if he keeps his eyes open long\
  \ enough, maybe he won't have to dream at all.
NIGHT_OWL.description.0.SUPPORT=If you need something from Barry, better check after\
  \ midnight - because that's when he's actually working. Inventory manifests? Updated at 3 AM.\
  \ Reports? Submitted right before dawn. The company has learned to just roll with it. "You can do\
  \ this at a normal time, you know." "Yeah, but I won't."
NIGHT_OWL.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's tools are always in motion long after everyone else has\
  \ passed out. Diagnostics, late-night assignment overhauls, last-minute job lists? That's when he\
  \ gets his best work done. "No distractions, no idiots asking questions - just me and the\
  \ machines," he says, taking a sip of something that definitely isn't just coffee.
NIGHT_OWL.description.2.SUPPORT=The company's debts. The worn-out equipment. The empty beds of\
  \ warriors who aren't coming back. Barry stays awake long after the others sleep, because someone\
  \ has to see it, to witness the slow collapse. He won't talk about it, won't wake anyone up - but\
  \ every night, he's there, staring at the ceiling, wondering how much longer it'll all last.

NOTE_TAKER.label=Compulsive Note-Taking
NOTE_TAKER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry keeps a small, weathered notebook strapped to his gear.\
  \ Enemy movements, ammo counts, battle formations - if it happens, he writes it down. Some joke\
  \ that he's trying to become a war historian, but when his notes reveal enemy patterns before\
  \ command does, no one's laughing.
NOTE_TAKER.description.1.COMBATANT=Every briefing, every engagement, every conversation - Barry is\
  \ writing. Notes in a datapad, shorthand scribbled on the back of his glove, coordinates\
  \ scratched into the inside of his cockpit. "Memory's unreliable," he says, flipping through\
  \ pages of previous battles. "Records last."
NOTE_TAKER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry writes names. He writes dates. He writes everything\
  \ because he's seen too many people vanish without a trace. No records. No burial. Just gone. So\
  \ he records them, their stories, their moments - because in a war where people disappear\
  \ overnight, maybe this way, they'll still exist.
NOTE_TAKER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's logs are legendary. Every job, every tool, every\
  \ assignment is recorded somewhere. "Paper trails save lives," he mutters, flipping through his\
  \ notes to prove - again - that the last batch of supplies was signed out three days ago. No one ever\
  \ wins arguments with Barry.
NOTE_TAKER.description.1.SUPPORT=Every shift, every report, every single action Barry takes gets\
  \ documented and his notes are meticulous. If someone asks for a status update, he doesn't\
  \ speak - he hands them a log entry with timestamps, materials used, and a breakdown of everything\
  \ that happened.
NOTE_TAKER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry keeps too many notes. Not just equipment statuses and\
  \ mission briefings, but the slow decay of everything around him. Fuel shortages. Unpaid wages.\
  \ The steady reduction of names in the payroll log. One day, someone will look back at his\
  \ records and see exactly when the company started dying. But for now, only he's paying\
  \ attention.

NOTEBOOK.label=Always Carrying a Notebook
NOTEBOOK.description.0.COMBATANT=Enemy formations, heat sink efficiency, which teammate still\
  \ owes him money - Barry documents it all. His notebook is crammed with mission notes, tactical\
  \ sketches, and half-finished thoughts written in hurried shorthand. "If I forget, it's my fault.\
  \ If I write it down, it's fact."
NOTEBOOK.description.1.COMBATANT=While others rely on intuition, Barry checks his notes. "Last\
  \ time we fought a lance like this, they favored a pincer maneuver," he mutters, flipping back\
  \ through pages. Some scoff at his reliance on old scribbles - until they realize his predictions\
  \ are almost always right.
NOTEBOOK.description.2.COMBATANT=Names of fallen comrades. Coordinates of battles no one\
  \ remembers. A tally of shots fired, Mechs destroyed, debts unpaid. Barry writes it all down\
  \ because if he doesn't, it'll be like it never happened. He doesn't trust history to remember\
  \ the truth. That's his job.
NOTEBOOK.description.0.SUPPORT=No matter what someone needs Barry has it written down. "I\
  \ logged that two weeks ago," he says, flipping through pages, already finding the answer before\
  \ anyone else even thinks to check a terminal. His system isn't digital, but it never fails.
NOTEBOOK.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't rely on memory. Every job requested, every\
  \ procedure performed, every minor incident - all of it goes in the notebook. He doesn't always\
  \ explain why he records so much, but if someone asks, he simply says, "Because someone has to."
NOTEBOOK.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's notebook isn't just logs - it's a record of decline.\
  \ Ration cuts, missing payments, the names of warriors who never came back. He writes it all\
  \ because no one else does. Because someday, the company will fall apart completely. And someone\
  \ should at least remember how it happened.

OBJECT.label=Carries a Personal Object
OBJECT.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry never enters battle without his one personal item - a lucky\
  \ coin, a worn-out playing card, a patch from an old uniform. "You don't mess with luck," he\
  \ says, tucking it into his pocket before every mission. Whether it actually helps or not, his\
  \ squad knows better than to question it.
OBJECT.description.1.COMBATANT=In the chaos of war, Barry keeps one thing constant. Maybe it's\
  \ a trinket from home, maybe it's something given to him by someone long gone. It doesn't matter\
  \ what it is - what matters is that it's his. When the battle's over and the adrenaline fades, he\
  \ grips it tight, reminding himself that he's still here.
OBJECT.description.2.COMBATANT=The object in Barry's possession isn't sentimental - it's\
  \ survival. A reminder of who he used to be, of a promise he couldn't keep, of a person he once\
  \ knew. He doesn't talk about it, doesn't let anyone touch it, doesn't explain why he refuses to\
  \ part with it. Some wounds don't bleed, but they never heal either.
OBJECT.description.0.SUPPORT=Whether it's a well-worn multitool, an old pocket watch, or a\
  \ scrap of a long faded photo, Barry's always carrying something familiar. "You gotta have\
  \ something of your own in a job like this," he says. No one knows where he got it, but they know\
  \ he'd notice immediately if it ever went missing.
OBJECT.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's job changes, his location changes, the people around him\
  \ change - but one thing never does. That personal item, the thing always tucked into a pocket,\
  \ clipped to his belt, or hidden inside his jacket. It's not about sentimentality. It's about\
  \ having something that stays the same.
OBJECT.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't keep his special object because it makes him\
  \ happy. He keeps it because it reminds him of what's been lost. A tag from a dead comrade, a\
  \ ring from a life left behind, a torn page from a book he never got to finish. He doesn't talk\
  \ about it. He doesn't need to. Anyone who looks into his eyes when he holds it already\
  \ understands.

ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.label=Obsessive Tendencies
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just follow orders - he perfects them. Whether it's\
  \ drilling a maneuver until it's second nature or recalibrating his weapon for the third time in\
  \ an hour, he won't stop until every variable is accounted for. His squad teases him for being\
  \ too precise - until they see him land a shot no one else could make.
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.1.COMBATANT=If an enemy gets away, Barry remembers. If a battle doesn't go\
  \ exactly as planned, he analyzes it endlessly. His obsession with what should have happened\
  \ keeps him awake at night, scribbling notes and running scenarios. The squad tells him to let it\
  \ go, but deep down, they know - his fixation makes him dangerous.
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's obsessiveness isn't just habit - it's desperation. He\
  \ can't stop tweaking his loadout, refining battle plans, checking his gear again and\
  \ again - because the moment he stops? The moment he trusts things to go as expected? That's when\
  \ people die. And he's already lost too many.
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just do his job - he masters it and triple-checks\
  \ everything. "There is no such thing as an acceptable margin of error," he mutters while going\
  \ over numbers again. Others may get frustrated with his constant rechecking, but they also\
  \ know - if Barry says it's right, it's right.
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.1.SUPPORT=No matter the task Barry refuses to call something finished\
  \ until it meets his impossibly high standards. "It's fine," someone tells him. "No," he replies,\
  \ making one last adjustment. "It's correct." The rest of the team has learned to let him\
  \ work - because once he's satisfied, the job is done right.
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's attention to detail isn't about perfection - it's about\
  \ control. He can't stop the war. He can't stop people from dying. But he can make sure that this\
  \ form is filed correctly. Because if he ever lets his mind wander to the things he can't fix,\
  \ he's not sure he'll come back from it.

ORGANIZER.label=Always Organizing
ORGANIZER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's gear is always perfectly arranged - pants folded, boots\
  \ cleaned and stored in exact order, emergency rations packed in a precise grid. His squad teases\
  \ him about it, but when they need something fast in the middle of a fight, he's the one who\
  \ always knows where to find it.
ORGANIZER.description.1.COMBATANT=Before every battle, Barry insists on running a final check.\
  \ Formation assignments? Confirmed. Backup comms? Verified. Extraction routes? Plotted and\
  \ re-plotted. "The battlefield is messy enough," he mutters. "No reason we have to be." The\
  \ others may roll their eyes, but when things go wrong, his plans are why they make it out alive.
ORGANIZER.description.2.COMBATANT=War is disorder, destruction, entropy. Barry fights back the\
  \ only way he can - by making sure his world stays structured. His clothes are perfectly aligned in\
  \ his locker. His boots are arranged at precise angles. His gear is exactly where it needs to be.\
  \ Because if he ever lets the chaos creep in, he knows it'll take more than just his\
  \ equipment - it'll take him, too.
ORGANIZER.description.0.SUPPORT=It doesn't matter if he's relaxing, performing his duties, or\
  \ handling reports - Barry makes sure everything is where it's supposed to be. Files? Sorted.\
  \ Tools? Arranged by frequency of use. Supplies? Restocked and labeled. No one questions his\
  \ methods anymore - because when they need something fast, Barry already has it ready.
ORGANIZER.description.1.SUPPORT=A cluttered workspace? Unacceptable. A jumbled manifest?\
  \ Unthinkable. If Barry walks into a messy storage room, he will reorganize it. "I don't care if\
  \ you know where everything is," he mutters, shifting crates into a more logical layout. "You'll\
  \ know where it is, and it'll make sense." The others sigh, but they also know - his system works.
ORGANIZER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry can't stop the war. He can't save everyone. But he can\
  \ make sure the medical kits are stocked, the equipment is sorted, the files are in perfect\
  \ order. If he controls the little things, maybe - just maybe - it'll feel like he has control over\
  \ something. Because deep down, he knows: no amount of organization can stop the unit from\
  \ falling apart.

ORIGAMI.label=Fond of Origami
ORIGAMI.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry spends downtime folding scraps of paper into precise,\
  \ intricate shapes. Battle maps, ration packaging, even old mission reports - nothing is safe from\
  \ his hands. His lance laughs, but there's something unnervingly methodical about the way he\
  \ creases each fold, like he's applying the same focus he does to planning a battle.
ORIGAMI.description.1.COMBATANT=No one knows when Barry does it, but somehow, there's always a\
  \ small paper crane, fox, or star waiting near his bunk, inside DropShips maintenance panels, or\
  \ tucked into the ammo crates. "Figure if we're always breaking things," he says with a shrug,\
  \ folding another, "I might as well make something for a change."
ORIGAMI.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's hands are steady in combat, but after the fight, when\
  \ the dust settles and the dead are counted, they start to tremble. So he folds. One precise\
  \ crease at a time, one careful movement after another, until the shaking stops. It doesn't erase\
  \ what he's done. But for a moment, it feels like he's creating something instead of destroying\
  \ it.
ORIGAMI.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's paperwork is always impeccable - and folded. Orders come\
  \ with little paper animals. Logs arrive with tiny folded stars attached. No one asks why he\
  \ does it, but no one throws them away, either.
ORIGAMI.description.1.SUPPORT=Long shifts, tight deadlines, and endless problems - Barry copes\
  \ by folding. A few seconds between tasks, a break between work cycles, even during long\
  \ meetings, his fingers move, folding something small, something precise. It doesn't interfere\
  \ with his work. If anything, it seems to help him focus.
ORIGAMI.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't know if anyone will remember him when this is all\
  \ over. The company, the contracts, the war - it all grinds people down, leaves no trace of them\
  \ behind. But maybe, just maybe, one of his paper cranes will still be sitting on a shelf long\
  \ after he's gone. Maybe that's enough.

OVER_PLANNER.label=Obsessive Over-Planner
OVER_PLANNER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just have a battle plan - he has twelve. If the\
  \ enemy flanks, if they get pinned down, if weather conditions shift unexpectedly - he's already\
  \ thought it through. His squad used to roll their eyes at his paranoia, but after surviving one\
  \ too many ambushes thanks to Barry's foresight, they don't complain anymore.
OVER_PLANNER.description.1.COMBATANT=Before the mission even begins, Barry has already memorized the\
  \ terrain, accounted for ammo reserves, and assigned every comrade a secondary role in case the\
  \ plan goes sideways. "You think too much," someone mutters. He doesn't argue. Thinking too much\
  \ is why he's still alive.
OVER_PLANNER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry remembers the battles that went wrong. The ones where no\
  \ one planned for an enemy counterattack, where the extraction route collapsed, where people died\
  \ because no one thought ahead. Now, he plans for everything. If he covers every angle, maybe he\
  \ won't have to carve another name into the side of his helmet.
OVER_PLANNER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's plans aren't just good - they're flawless. Every task is\
  \ mapped with maximum efficiency, every request is cross-checked with projected future needs.\
  \ "You can't just plan for today," he mutters, marking another contingency on his datapad. "You\
  \ have to plan for six months from now."
OVER_PLANNER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry refuses to let anything be left to chance. He's mapped out\
  \ every possible outcome, every risk, and probably has a backup plan for his backup plan. No one\
  \ argues with him anymore - not because they agree, but because he always wins.
OVER_PLANNER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry plans too much because he knows what happens when people\
  \ don't. The battle they weren't ready for. The wounded they didn't have enough supplies for. The\
  \ time he wasn't fast enough, smart enough, prepared enough to stop what was coming. So now, he\
  \ plans for everything. Because if he misses something again, he might not be able to live with\
  \ it.

OVEREXPLAINER.label=Chronic Overexplainer
OVEREXPLAINER.description.0.COMBATANT="Barry, what's the plan?" Instead of a quick response, his\
  \ squad gets every possible detail. Terrain conditions, enemy positioning, historical precedent\
  \ for similar battles. By the time he's done explaining, the fight has already started.
OVEREXPLAINER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just call out targets - he explains why they're the\
  \ priority. He doesn't just suggest a strategy - he details every reason it works. His squad\
  \ appreciates the thought, but sometimes they just want to hear "Shoot that guy" instead of a\
  \ five-minute breakdown of flanking maneuvers.
OVEREXPLAINER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry used to assume orders were clear. Then he watched people\
  \ die because they weren't. Now, he explains everything, over and over, ensuring there's zero\
  \ room for misinterpretation. It makes him insufferable. But if it saves even one more life, he\
  \ can live with that.
OVEREXPLAINER.description.0.SUPPORT="You want more supplies? Let me explain the supply chain\
  \ constraints affecting that." Barry doesn't just approve or deny requests - he breaks down why\
  \ certain items are in short supply, how much fuel it takes to move them, and how much worse it\
  \ could be. No one asks for clarification anymore because it never ends.
OVEREXPLAINER.description.1.SUPPORT=Need something done? Barry will absolutely do it - but not before\
  \ explaining exactly why it needed to be done, how it should be prevented, and the entire history\
  \ of the problems like this. "Barry, can you just do it?" "Yes, but first, you need to understand\
  \ the problem."
OVEREXPLAINER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry explains everything because if he stops talking, he might\
  \ have to think. About the war. About how many people he's known up who didn't make it. About the\
  \ numbers on the payroll sheet that keep shrinking. So he fills the silence with words, drowning\
  \ out the thoughts he doesn't want to face.

PEN_CLICKER.label=Habitual Pen Clicker
PEN_CLICKER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's pen clicks in steady rhythm while he processes a battle\
  \ plan, studies an enemy formation, or reviews battlecam footage. Click. Click. Click. It's not\
  \ nerves - it's focus. His squad knows that if the clicking stops, it means he's either figured\
  \ something out - or something's about to go very wrong.
PEN_CLICKER.description.1.COMBATANT=It doesn't matter if he's in a war room, a cockpit, or an\
  \ active battlefield - if Barry has a pen, he's clicking it. "Do you have to do that?" someone\
  \ groans during a mission briefing. "Yes," he says, still clicking. They don't believe him, but\
  \ he never stops.
PEN_CLICKER.description.2.COMBATANT=The battlefield is chaos. Orders shift, people die, plans fall\
  \ apart - but Barry's pen still clicks, a tiny, steady noise in the storm. Click. Click. Click. A\
  \ reminder that he's still here, still thinking, still in control of something. If he stops, he\
  \ might have to face the things he can't control. And that's not an option.
PEN_CLICKER.description.0.SUPPORT=Every request, every review, every inventory count - click, click,\
  \ click. Barry doesn't even realize he's doing it. But if you hear the rapid-fire clicking of a\
  \ pen, you know he's deep in thought, solving a problem no one else has noticed yet.
PEN_CLICKER.description.1.SUPPORT=Meetings, briefings, payroll discussions - Barry's pen clicks\
  \ through all of them. "You're driving me insane," someone mutters. "Am I?" Click. No one has\
  \ been brave enough to steal the pen yet, but the betting pool on who tries first is growing.
PEN_CLICKER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's pen is always in motion, always clicking, because if it\
  \ isn't, his hands start to shake. If he stops, the silence creeps in, bringing thoughts he\
  \ doesn't want. So he clicks. He clicks while signing off reports. He clicks while logging\
  \ another failed task. He clicks because if he stops, he might not start again.

PEN_TWIRLER.label=Habitual Pen Twirler
PEN_TWIRLER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's fingers are always in motion, twirling a pen with the\
  \ same precision he uses to fire a weapon. His squad swears he could take down an enemy just by\
  \ flicking it hard enough. If the pen stops moving, it means he's actually paying attention - and\
  \ that's when people start getting nervous.
PEN_TWIRLER.description.1.COMBATANT=It doesn't matter if he's in a battle briefing, riding in a\
  \ DropShip, or crouched behind cover while autocannons roar overhead - Barry's pen twirls between\
  \ his fingers like he hasn't just been shot at. "Do you ever stop that?" someone asks. "Haven't\
  \ dropped it yet," he replies, spinning it again without looking.
PEN_TWIRLER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry keeps his hands busy because if they stop, his mind\
  \ wanders. Back to the names he's crossed out. Back to the missions that went wrong. So he spins\
  \ the pen. Over and over. Faster. Slower. Anything to keep his fingers moving, to keep the\
  \ silence from creeping in.
PEN_TWIRLER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just process requests - he performs them, flipping a\
  \ pen through his fingers while rattling off numbers. Spin. Catch. Somehow, he never drops it.
PEN_TWIRLER.description.1.SUPPORT=Whether he's filling out paperwork, troubleshooting, or giving a\
  \ report, Barry's pen never stops spinning. "That's going to fly out of your hand one day,"\
  \ someone says. "Not today," he replies, flipping it behind his back and catching it without\
  \ looking.
PEN_TWIRLER.description.2.SUPPORT=The numbers keep getting worse. The casualty lists keep getting\
  \ longer. The debts pile up, the supplies run low, the repairs take longer every time. Barry\
  \ can't fix it all, but he can spin the pen, keep it moving, keep something predictable in a\
  \ universe that refuses to be.

PERSONIFICATION.label=Overly Friendly with Equipment
PERSONIFICATION.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just maintain his gear - he talks to it. "Alright,\
  \ sweetheart, let's not jam on me today." His sidearm gets a pep talk before every battle, and\
  \ his knife? He's got a name for that, too. His squad has stopped questioning it - it seems to work.
PERSONIFICATION.description.1.COMBATANT=
PERSONIFICATION.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's comrades keep dying. His gear? it stays. So he talks to\
  \ it, maintains it with care, treats it like they're alive - because at least they won't bleed out\
  \ on him. At least they won't leave.
PERSONIFICATION.description.0.SUPPORT="Alright, my beauties, let's see what we've got today," Barry\
  \ grins as he opens another shipment. No matter what they are, each new tool gets an\
  \ introduction, a small moment of appreciation. "You don't have to talk to the equipment,"\
  \ someone says. "And you don't have to breathe," he shoots back, continuing his inventory.
PERSONIFICATION.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry chats with the equipment. "C'mon, don't do this to me\
  \ now," he mutters while smacking a console. "I just fixed you." The weird part? It actually\
  \ seems to work.
PERSONIFICATION.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry used to joke with his lance. Used to trade stories, give\
  \ pep talks, laugh. Now, the machines get all of that. They don't die. They don't betray. They\
  \ don't leave him behind. So he talks to them like they're real, because if he doesn't... the\
  \ silence might finally break him.

PESSIMIST.label=Habitual Pessimist
PESSIMIST.description.0.COMBATANT="We're walking into a trap," Barry mutters as the mission\
  \ briefing ends. "How do you know?" someone asks. "Because we're still breathing - means the\
  \ universe isn't done screwing with us yet." No matter the odds, no matter how good things look,\
  \ Barry is always prepared for something to go wrong.
PESSIMIST.description.1.COMBATANT="We won the battle, Barry, lighten up." He shakes his head.\
  \ "Sure, but now we're low on ammo, our Mechs are trashed, and command's gonna send us into an\
  \ even worse fight next time. We never actually win - we just survive until the next mess." The\
  \ worst part? He's usually right
PESSIMIST.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry isn't just pessimistic - he's realistic. He's seen\
  \ victories turn to disasters, seen friends make promises they didn't live to keep. So when he\
  \ sighs and mutters, "This won't end well," it's not cynicism. It's experience. And it's another\
  \ name he's getting ready to cross out.
PESSIMIST.description.0.SUPPORT="We've got enough fuel for the next campaign, Barry." He scoffs.\
  \ "Assuming we don't get shorted on the next shipment, or the price spikes, or some idiot burns\
  \ through half our reserves on a miscalculation." If there's a way for things to go wrong,\
  \ Barry's already considered it twice.
PESSIMIST.description.1.SUPPORT=If something actually goes smoothly, Barry gets nervous. "This\
  \ was too easy," he mutters while reviewing logs. "Nothing ever works this well. Either we missed\
  \ something, or something's about to hit the fan." No one takes him seriously - until he's right.\
  \ Again.
PESSIMIST.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry wasn't always like this. He used to hope. Used to think\
  \ things might turn around. Then he counted too many empty bunks, saw too many names vanish from\
  \ payroll, lost too many shipments that never arrived. Now? He just assumes the worst. It's\
  \ easier that way. At least it means he's never surprised.

PHRASES.label=Tends to Use Specific Phrases
PHRASES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's squad can predict his responses before he even speaks.\
  \ "This is gonna suck." "If I die, delete my debts." "Oh great, another suicide mission." His\
  \ catchphrases aren't just habit - they're a coping mechanism. When everything else is chaos, at\
  \ least his words stay the same.
PHRASES.description.1.COMBATANT="A bad plan executed well beats a good plan executed poorly."\
  \ "Information is ammunition!" "Nobody wins in war, they just get to fight the next one." Barry's\
  \ phrases aren't original, but they stick. New recruits pick them up without realizing it, until\
  \ suddenly they're repeating his words on the battlefield.
PHRASES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry wasn't always like this. His phrases? They weren't his\
  \ first. Some belonged to comrades who aren't around anymore. Some were last words. Some were\
  \ muttered over comms, half-forgotten in the haze of war. He says them because if he doesn't,\
  \ those people are truly gone.
PHRASES.description.0.SUPPORT="Do I look like a magician?" "You want it done when? Hah."\
  \ "Sure, I'll pull that out of my magic supply crate full of things we don't have." Barry has a\
  \ standard rotation of responses to requests, all variations of 'You're not getting what you\
  \ want, but I'll try anyway.'
PHRASES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has his go-to lines. "Not my problem - until it is." "You\
  \ break it, you bought it." "This wasn't in my job description, and yet, here I am." At this\
  \ point, his coworkers just accept it as part of the job.
PHRASES.description.2.SUPPORT="It'll hold." "We'll figure something out." "Things'll work\
  \ out." Barry repeats the same reassurances over and over, not because he believes them, but\
  \ because it's what people need to hear. He knows the truth. But saying it wouldn't help anyone,\
  \ least of all himself.

PLANTS.label=Loves Plants
PLANTS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's gear is always pristine, his sidearm\
  \ well-maintained - right next to a small potted plant he keeps in his bunk. "Everything else in\
  \ this job dies," he says, misting its leaves. "Might as well keep one thing alive." His squad\
  \ teases him, but they've also learned not to mess with it.
PLANTS.description.1.COMBATANT="That's a snake plant. Tough as hell, doesn't need much,\
  \ survives in low light. Kind of like us." Barry's the type to compare a campaign to crop\
  \ rotation and an ambush to invasive species competition. His squad has learned to just nod along\
  \ when he starts explaining plant biology mid-mission.
PLANTS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has taken so many lives. Bombed forests, scorched\
  \ farmland, turned green fields into battlefields. So he grows plants - not to balance the scales\
  \ (nothing could), but to remind himself that creation is still possible. That not everything has\
  \ to be reduced to ash.
PLANTS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's storage room isn't just crates and tools - it's also full\
  \ of plants. "They help with air quality," he claims, watering a row of succulents next to a rack\
  \ of medical supplies. Everyone lets it slide because, honestly? It does make the place feel less\
  \ miserable.
PLANTS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry always finds time to check his plants. "You're looking\
  \ real good today, buddy," he murmurs to a sprouting seedling. His coworkers have long since\
  \ stopped questioning it - unless they catch him slipping extra water rations for them.
PLANTS.description.2.SUPPORT=Plants don't fight. They don't betray. They don't die screaming.\
  \ Barry grows them because they're simple. Because in a life where everything falls apart,\
  \ they're the only thing that doesn't ask anything of him. He doesn't expect to survive this war.\
  \ But maybe, just maybe, his plants will.

POLITE.label=Excessive Politeness
POLITE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry thanks the quartermaster when he picks up his ammunition,\
  \ apologizes when he shoots an enemy, and says "excuse me" when shoving someone out of the way of\
  \ an incoming missile. His squad doesn't understand how he manages to be so polite while covered\
  \ in blood and dust, but at this point, it's just his thing.
POLITE.description.1.COMBATANT="Pardon me, but I believe that's my cover." "Terribly sorry,\
  \ but I am about to fire at you." Barry's enemies don't know how to handle the fact that he's\
  \ alarmingly courteous while actively trying to kill them. His squad swears that one day, an\
  \ enemy will surrender just because they feel bad for interrupting his manners.
POLITE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry says "please" and "thank you" because everything else\
  \ about his life is brutal. The orders, the fighting, the constant death - none of it feels right.\
  \ But if he can still show some basic decency, if he can still be civilized, then maybe he hasn't\
  \ lost himself to the war completely.
POLITE.description.0.SUPPORT="I do regret to inform you that we are completely out of spare\
  \ batteries, and I deeply apologize for any inconvenience this may cause." Barry speaks like he's\
  \ declining a dinner invitation. Somehow, his tone makes it even more frustrating.
POLITE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's manners never drop. He refers to rookies as "sir" and\
  \ "ma'am," always prefaces bad news with deeply formal condolences, and thanks people for their\
  \ patience - even when they definitely don't have any.
POLITE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry knows how cruel the world is. He's seen what happens when\
  \ people stop caring, stop being human. So he clings to formality, to pleasantries, to basic\
  \ courtesy. He bows his head when passing the dead, murmurs "I'm so sorry" when patching up\
  \ another wounded soldier. If he stops being polite, he's afraid of what he'll become.

PRACTICAL_JOKER.label=Loves Practical Jokes
PRACTICAL_JOKER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry takes warfare very seriously - right up until the moment he\
  \ tapes over someone's targeting reticle with a tiny, smiling skull sticker. His squad knows that\
  \ if things have been too quiet, someone is about to find their personal comms blasting\
  \ MechWarrior recruitment jingles in the middle of battle.
PRACTICAL_JOKER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry rigs the barracks door to announce everyone's full rank\
  \ and name when they enter. He swaps someone's comm ID so they sound exactly like the unit\
  \ commander. Even in the middle of a war, he finds ways to make people laugh - because sometimes,\
  \ that's the only thing keeping them from breaking.
PRACTICAL_JOKER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry pranks because if he stops, he'll have to process the\
  \ horror around him. Every practical joke is a distraction, a way to keep things light even when\
  \ the air feels like death. The day Barry stops joking is the day his squad knows things have\
  \ truly gone to hell.
PRACTICAL_JOKER.description.0.SUPPORT=Here's your mission briefings, and a surprise!" Barry grins as a\
  \ warrior opens the box to find a single bright pink paint can labeled 'EXPERIMENTAL CAMO.' He's\
  \ mastered the art of harmless, mildly infuriating pranks - but never enough to get himself\
  \ actually fired.
PRACTICAL_JOKER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry reroutes coffee machine settings so they all dispense\
  \ decaf, rearranges locker labels just slightly, and convinces rookies that "JumpShip gravity\
  \ loss training" involves sprinting toward a bulkhead wall. No one's safe - but somehow, they all\
  \ love him for it.
PRACTICAL_JOKER.description.2.SUPPORT=The budget's failing. People are dying. Morale is nonexistent.\
  \ Barry keeps joking because someone has to. Someone has to keep something light in a world that\
  \ only gets darker. Because the moment no one laughs at his pranks anymore... that's when he knows\
  \ it's really over.

PREPARED.label=Always Prepared
PREPARED.description.0.COMBATANT=Need extra ammo? Barry already packed it. Medkit? Right here.\
  \ Contingency for if the mission inevitably goes sideways? He's got a plan. His squad has learned\
  \ that if Barry tells them to carry an extra power cell, they don't ask why - they just do it.
PREPARED.description.1.COMBATANT="Check your seals. Check your ammo. Check everything twice,"\
  \ Barry reminds his team every deployment. He isn't paranoid - he's survived enough bad situations\
  \ to know that being unprepared is just another way of asking to die.
PREPARED.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry isn't just prepared - he's ready for everything. Because\
  \ he's seen what happens when people aren't. The last time someone forgot to check their\
  \ equipment, they didn't come back. The last time a squad got sloppy, they left a graveyard\
  \ behind. He won't make those mistakes. He can't afford to.
PREPARED.description.0.SUPPORT="You're gonna want an extra medkit," Barry says, handing it over\
  \ before the MechWarrior even asks. "How did you - ?" "Because I know you." His ability to\
  \ anticipate needs borders on psychic. No one questions it.
PREPARED.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry never leaves anything to chance. He doesn't just have a\
  \ backup plan - he has three. "Hope for the best," he mutters, sealing another redundant supply\
  \ crate, "but prepare for the worst."
PREPARED.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry stocks extra bandages because he's watched people bleed\
  \ out when there weren't enough. He double-checks oxygen reserves because he's seen what\
  \ suffocation looks like. He prepares not because he's cautious - but because he knows what happens\
  \ when you're not.

PUNCTUAL.label=Overly Punctual
PUNCTUAL.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry isn't just on time for deployments - he's early. While the\
  \ rest of the squad rolls in groggy and adjusting their gear, he's already double-checking his\
  \ weapons, reviewing the mission plan, and glaring at anyone who thinks "five minutes late" is\
  \ acceptable.
PUNCTUAL.description.1.COMBATANT="Being late is the fastest way to get killed." Barry drills it\
  \ into every rookie he meets. In war, seconds matter - hesitate, delay, miss your mark, and you're\
  \ dead. His squad jokes that he sets his watch five minutes fast just to make sure he's never\
  \ late. They're only half wrong.
PUNCTUAL.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry once showed up late to a fight. He doesn't talk about\
  \ what happened afterward, but his unit didn't walk away intact. Now, he's never late. Never\
  \ behind. Never a second off schedule. Because if he is, it means someone else might not make it.\
  \ And he refuses to let that happen again.
PUNCTUAL.description.0.SUPPORT=If Barry says a report will be ready at 0600, it's ready at\
  \ 0600. Not a second later. Anyone who dares show up late for a job gets the look - the one that\
  \ says you are now the reason my entire system is off by 45 seconds, and I will remember this.
PUNCTUAL.description.1.SUPPORT=Every shift, every meeting, every single task in Barry's day\
  \ runs exactly on schedule. If he says a task takes 32 minutes, it takes 32 minutes. "It's about\
  \ efficiency," he mutters as he checks his watch for the third time in a minute. His coworkers\
  \ have learned that if you're late, you might as well not show up at all.
PUNCTUAL.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry is never late because if he's always busy, always moving,\
  \ always on schedule, he doesn't have to think about the people who are never showing up again.\
  \ He fills his time, controls it down to the second, because if he ever lets himself fall behind,\
  \ he might start remembering what he's lost.

PUZZLES.label=Obsessed with Puzzles
PUZZLES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he analyzes. Enemy formations, terrain\
  \ advantages, supply lines - it's all one giant puzzle waiting to be unraveled. "Every problem has\
  \ a solution," he mutters, adjusting his sights. The only question is whether he finds it before\
  \ someone gets killed.
PUZZLES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry can't not try to break things down. He spends downtime\
  \ solving riddles, tweaking battle plans, or picking apart mission briefings like they're\
  \ crossword clues. "It's just a simple recon op, Barry." He shakes his head. "That's what they\
  \ want you to think."
PUZZLES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry needs to solve puzzles, because once, he couldn't. A\
  \ battle gone wrong, a mystery that cost lives, a decision that left him with too many empty\
  \ chairs around the table. Now, he pieces things together obsessively, trying to prove to himself\
  \ that there's always a way out - he just has to find it in time.
PUZZLES.description.0.SUPPORT=Managing his tasks isn't just a job for Barry - it's a game. Every\
  \ day is another piece in the ever-changing puzzle of how to keep the company running. He doesn't\
  \ just solve problems - he anticipates them.
PUZZLES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry can't resist a puzzle. "Barry, we need those power cells\
  \ moved." "Sure thing - oh, but look at this encryption key, someone tried to hide something\
  \ here..." His coworkers have learned to either give him puzzles on purpose or rip them out of his\
  \ hands before he gets lost in them.
PUZZLES.description.2.SUPPORT=A shipment lost, another contract failed, another person missing\
  \ from the roster. Barry can't fix those things. But he can decrypt an old DropShip manifest, or\
  \ solve an old Terran cipher. He focuses on the puzzles he can solve so he doesn't have to think\
  \ about the ones he never will.

QUOTES.label=Collects Quotes
QUOTES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry has a quote for everything. Before a mission? "Fortune\
  \ favors the bold." After losing a comrade? "War does not determine who is right, only who is\
  \ left." Some find it inspiring. Others wish he'd just shut up and fight.
QUOTES.description.1.COMBATANT="Alexander once said - " "Barry, please." Whether it's an ancient\
  \ philosopher or a forgotten MechWarrior, he always has a quote to fit the situation. His lance\
  \ tolerates it because, somehow, his endless library of words actually makes them think.
QUOTES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just collect quotes - he clings to them. They're\
  \ the words of people who survived, who understood the world before him. Repeating them means he\
  \ doesn't have to come up with his own answers. Because if he did, he might have to admit he\
  \ doesn't have any left.
QUOTES.description.0.SUPPORT="Request approved. 'walk softly and carry a big gun.'" Every\
  \ document Barry signs comes with an extra line of borrowed wisdom. No one's sure why he does it,\
  \ but it's hard to be mad when a report arrives exactly as promised, with just the right words\
  \ attached.
QUOTES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry always has a quote ready. "A stitch in time saves nine."\
  \ "No plan survives first contact with the enemy." He insists they're relevant. His coworkers\
  \ suspect he just enjoys the theatrics.
QUOTES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry writes down quotes because he's afraid the voices of the\
  \ past will disappear. Commanders, poets, warriors - they all left something behind. Something\
  \ worth remembering. Because if their words can last, maybe - just maybe - something about him will,\
  \ too.

RARELY_SLEEPS.label=Rarely Sleeps
RARELY_SLEEPS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry claims he can't sleep. "Too much to do, not enough time,"\
  \ he mutters, rubbing exhaustion from his eyes. Yet somehow, despite the late nights and early\
  \ deployments, he never misses a mission. His squad doesn't know how he keeps going, but they're\
  \ starting to think he might not, for much longer.
RARELY_SLEEPS.description.1.COMBATANT=Sleep is for people who don't have things to worry about. Barry\
  \ is up before dawn, checking weapons, analyzing enemy movements, running drills in his head.\
  \ "You should sleep, Barry." "So should you," he fires back, sipping something definitely\
  \ stronger than coffee.
RARELY_SLEEPS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry closes his eyes and sees them - the dead, the battles gone\
  \ wrong, the faces of those who won't be in the next deployment. So he doesn't sleep. He just\
  \ keeps moving, keeps planning, keeps doing something, because the moment he stops, the memories\
  \ will catch up.
RARELY_SLEEPS.description.0.SUPPORT=Need something at 3 AM? Barry's already awake. No one knows when\
  \ he sleeps, only that he's always at his desk, fixing problems before anyone else even notices\
  \ them. "Barry, go to bed." "Bed's more of a suggestion than a location."
RARELY_SLEEPS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry treats sleep as optional. "We've got deadlines." "We've\
  \ got a mission." "We've got so much work to do." He pushes himself harder than anyone else and\
  \ gets frustrated when others can't keep up. Not because he's angry - because if they need sleep,\
  \ that means he's doing something wrong.
RARELY_SLEEPS.description.2.SUPPORT=Sleep is surrender. Sleep is vulnerability. Sleep is trusting\
  \ that when he wakes up, everything won't have collapsed overnight. Barry doesn't trust that\
  \ anymore. He keeps moving, keeps working, keeps doing something, because stopping? Stopping\
  \ means realizing just how bad things really are.

ROUTINE.label=Has a Routine for Small Tasks
ROUTINE.description.0.COMBATANT=Before every battle, Barry follows the same sequence-adjust his\
  \ gloves twice, tighten his straps in the same order, tap his helmet once. "Superstition?"\
  \ someone asks. "No," he replies. "Just making sure everything's right." But his squad knows-if\
  \ his routine is ever disrupted, he's off his game.
ROUTINE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry preps his weapons the exact same way before every\
  \ mission. Field strips, recalibrates, reloads-even if they don't need it. "Why do you keep doing\
  \ that?" someone asks. He shrugs. "Routine keeps you sharp." What he doesn't say? Without it,\
  \ the battlefield feels too unpredictable.
ROUTINE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has to do things in order-check gear, stretch, reload,\
  \ adjust his HUD, breathe. If he doesn't? The battlefield feels wrong. War is chaos, loss,\
  \ failure. But if he can control one thing, just one, maybe it'll be enough to keep himself\
  \ together.
ROUTINE.description.0.SUPPORT=No one interrupts Barry's process. Supply check at 0600. Ration\
  \ logs at 0730. Gear inspections exactly at 1100. Any change to the order? Unacceptable. "Barry,\
  \ can't you skip a step?" "No," he says flatly, already organizing another routine.
ROUTINE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has an unbreakable routine. "It's efficient," he claims.\
  \ But if someone tries to rush him, he still sticks to his routine. "Break the order," he\
  \ mutters, "and that's when things go wrong."
ROUTINE.description.2.SUPPORT=The company is bleeding resources. The pay is late. Another bunk\
  \ is empty. Barry can't stop the decline, but he can follow his routines. If the paperwork is\
  \ done just right, if the tools are placed exactly where they belong, if he does everything in\
  \ perfect sequence-maybe it'll feel like things aren't slipping away.

SEEKS_APPROVAL.label=Constantly Seeking Approval
SEEKS_APPROVAL.description.0.COMBATANT=Every time Barry lands a shot or executes an order, his eyes\
  \ flick toward his lance. "Good call, right?" "That was the right move, yeah?" He's skilled, damn\
  \ skilled, but he still needs to hear it-needs someone to confirm that he's doing the right thing.
SEEKS_APPROVAL.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry knows what he's doing, but he still asks. "You sure about\
  \ this plan?" "We're really going in now?" He won't commit until someone gives him a nod, a pat\
  \ on the shoulder, anything to prove he's not messing up. He's not afraid of battle-he's afraid\
  \ of disappointing someone.
SEEKS_APPROVAL.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen what happens to warriors who fail. The ones who\
  \ weren't good enough. The ones who made the wrong call. The ones whose names are scratched off\
  \ the roster and never spoken again. So he asks-constantly, obsessively-because if no one tells\
  \ him he's doing well, maybe he's next.
SEEKS_APPROVAL.description.0.SUPPORT="I got everything squared away ahead of schedule-was that\
  \ helpful?" "I prioritized the tool shipments over the rations-was that the right call?" Barry\
  \ knows he's efficient, but he still needs someone to tell him he made the right decision.
SEEKS_APPROVAL.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has a report ready to go, job fully handled, and manifests\
  \ double-checked-but he won't submit anything without someone approving it first. "Just want to\
  \ make sure it's right," he says, waiting for a nod before proceeding. It slows things down, but\
  \ he can't help it.
SEEKS_APPROVAL.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't ask for validation because he enjoys it-he asks\
  \ because he needs it. Because in a world where people disappear overnight, where names get wiped\
  \ off records like they never existed, he has to hear that he's useful. That he's needed. Because\
  \ if he isn't, then what's keeping him from vanishing next?

SENTIMENTAL.label=Overly Sentimental
SENTIMENTAL.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's locker is full of small, seemingly insignificant\
  \ items-a spent shell casing from his first battle, a scrap of fabric from an old unit patch, a\
  \ dented dog tag that isn't his. "They're just reminders," he says when asked. Reminders of what,\
  \ he never says.
SENTIMENTAL.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry names his weapons, personalizes his armor, and refuses to\
  \ let go of anything with history. His comrades? He remembers every detail about them-their\
  \ favorite drinks, the songs they hum, the reasons they fight. Losing someone breaks him a little\
  \ more each time.
SENTIMENTAL.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry refuses to throw anything away-every scrap, every\
  \ trinket, every memory means something. Because war erases people. It wipes them out. And if he\
  \ doesn't hold onto what little remains, who will?
SENTIMENTAL.description.0.SUPPORT="This laser's been with us since the second campaign. You do not\
  \ just toss it aside." Barry treats old gear with reverence, patching up damaged equipment long\
  \ past its prime because it deserves better than to be scrapped.
SENTIMENTAL.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry remembers birthdays, keeps old rosters even when people\
  \ are long gone, and still refers to former coworkers like they just left. "They were good\
  \ people," he says, voice a little too soft. "They mattered."
SENTIMENTAL.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has a list. Names of every soldier he's known, every MedTech\
  \ who's patched them up, every mechanic who's worked on their gear. He reads it sometimes,\
  \ whispering each name like a prayer. He has to remember them-because someday, there won't be\
  \ anyone left who does.

SHARPENING.label=Compulsive Sharpening
SHARPENING.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry isn't just prepared-he's precise. Every knife, or tool in\
  \ his kit is honed to perfection. He sharpens his combat blade before every mission, during\
  \ downtime, and even mid-briefing. His lance jokes that he'd sharpen a laser if he could.
SHARPENING.description.1.COMBATANT=When Barry isn't in battle, he's sitting with a whetstone,\
  \ running it over the edge of his blade again and again. It doesn't matter if it's already\
  \ sharp-he keeps at it anyway. It's not about the blade. It's about the motion, the control, the\
  \ focus. His team has learned that if Barry's sharpening in silence, it's best to leave him be.
SHARPENING.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry can't control the war. He can't stop people from dying.\
  \ But he can make sure his weapon is sharp. Every pass of the stone, every adjustment to the\
  \ angle-it's something tangible, something real, something that won't fail him. Because in a\
  \ universe where everything else falls apart, at least his blade will always be ready.
SHARPENING.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry insists that everything stays sharp. Knives? Obviously.\
  \ Tools? Absolutely. A can opener? You bet. He's been caught sharpening wrenches before, and no\
  \ one knows if he's serious or if he just needs to keep something in motion.
SHARPENING.description.1.SUPPORT=Whether he's fixing equipment, sorting supplies, or handling a\
  \ task, Barry always has something in his hands, sharpening it absentmindedly. "Barry, is that a\
  \ machete?" "Yep." "Why are you sharpening it?" He doesn't answer. He just keeps going.
SHARPENING.description.2.SUPPORT=The war grinds people down, but Barry grinds steel. If his hands\
  \ are busy, his mind isn't dwelling on the latest casualty report, the missing shipments, the\
  \ debts stacking up. So he sharpens. And sharpens. And sharpens. Because if he stops, the\
  \ thoughts catch up.

SINGS.label=Sings to Themselves
SINGS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry sings softly, barely audible over the crackle of comms.\
  \ It's an old war tune, a bar song, or some half-forgotten melody from a planet he barely\
  \ remembers. The squad knows that if they hear him singing, the fight hasn't really started yet.\
  \ If he stops? That's when things have gone bad.
SINGS.description.1.COMBATANT="Barry, why are you singing right now?" "Because it helps me\
  \ focus." It doesn't matter if they're pinned down or charging into an ambush-Barry always has a\
  \ song under his breath, a slow and steady rhythm that somehow makes the chaos around him seem a\
  \ little more manageable.
SINGS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry sings because silence means remembering. It means\
  \ thinking about the battles he barely survived, the people who didn't, the wreckage left behind.\
  \ The melody keeps those thoughts at bay, drowns out the ghosts whispering in the quiet. If he\
  \ ever stops singing, it's because there's no one left to sing for.
SINGS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry works to a tune, humming as he clears the rota, whistling\
  \ while fixing manifest errors, occasionally breaking into full song when the numbers actually\
  \ balance for once. No one's sure if he even realizes he's doing it, but at this point, his\
  \ coworkers consider it part of the daily routine.
SINGS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry hums constantly. Sometimes it's an old folk song,\
  \ sometimes it's entirely made up, but it's always there. "It helps me concentrate," he says. His\
  \ coworkers don't mind-it makes the long shifts feel a little less empty.
SINGS.description.2.SUPPORT=The war grinds people down. Names disappear from rosters, beds\
  \ go empty, another late-night report comes in full of losses. Barry sings because if he stops,\
  \ he'll have to process it all. As long as the song keeps going, so does he.

SKEPTICAL.label=Chronically Skeptical
SKEPTICAL.description.0.COMBATANT="Smooth operation, minimal resistance," the commander says.\
  \ Barry scoffs. "Uh-huh. And I suppose the enemy didn't get the memo?" He's heard too many\
  \ promises of 'easy missions' that turned into bloodbaths. He doesn't assume disaster-he just\
  \ prepares for it every time.
SKEPTICAL.description.1.COMBATANT="We're supposed to trust intel from who?" Barry demands, arms\
  \ crossed. If a plan sounds too clean, he assumes it's wrong. If an enemy retreats too fast, he\
  \ assumes they're baiting them in. He's not paranoid, he insists-he's just still alive.
SKEPTICAL.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry trusts no one-not command, not locals, not even his own\
  \ allies completely. Too many times, the people he relied on turned out to be lying, compromised,\
  \ or already dead. So now? Now he assumes everything is a trick until proven otherwise.
SKEPTICAL.description.0.SUPPORT="The shipment's 'on schedule?' Sure, I'll believe it when I see\
  \ it." Barry assumes every delivery is late, every contract is skewed, and every report is\
  \ missing critical details. He's never pleasantly surprised-but he's also never unprepared.
SKEPTICAL.description.1.SUPPORT="The convoy's fine? The system's stable? Uh-huh, sure." Barry\
  \ checks everything twice, then once more just in case. If someone insists a problem is solved,\
  \ he immediately assumes it isn't. His coworkers roll their eyes-until he catches an issue they\
  \ swore wasn't there.
SKEPTICAL.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's been told things would get better. That command would\
  \ come through. That there was enough time, enough resources, enough hope. None of it was true.\
  \ So now, he trusts nothing at face value. Because the one time he does? That's when it'll all\
  \ come crashing down.

SLEEP_TALKER.label=Talks in Sleep
SLEEP_TALKER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's lance has learned not to bunk near him unless they want\
  \ to hear a full mission replay at 3 AM. "Take the flank-no, not that way! Damn it-" He barks\
  \ commands, mutters tactics, and sometimes lets out a low chuckle-like he just won a fight that\
  \ never happened.
SLEEP_TALKER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry sleeps, but his brain doesn't. He mutters coordinates,\
  \ lists off supply counts, or recites mission orders word for word. "Barry, you were telling us\
  \ where to take cover in your sleep." He shrugs. "Yeah? And was I wrong?"
SLEEP_TALKER.description.2.COMBATANT=Sometimes Barry's voice is barely a whisper. Names. Places.\
  \ Pleas. Things that shouldn't be heard. Those who wake up and listen know better than to mention\
  \ it in the morning. Because whatever he's remembering? It's something he can't let go of.
SLEEP_TALKER.description.0.SUPPORT="Check the manifests. Who authorized that last shipment?" Barry\
  \ doesn't just talk in his sleep-he works in it. His bunkmates have stopped waking him up,\
  \ choosing instead to write down his half-conscious ramblings, just in case he catches something\
  \ they missed.
SLEEP_TALKER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's nighttime mumbling is half-practical, half-nonsense. One\
  \ night it's "Gotta fix that...," the next it's "Why is the DropShip full of goats?" No one\
  \ knows what his brain is doing, but it's oddly fascinating to listen to.
SLEEP_TALKER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't talk about certain things while awake. But when\
  \ sleep takes him, his mind leaks-regrets, confessions, fears. "Should've been me." "We never\
  \ should've trusted them." "There's no way out of this, is there?" His coworkers pretend they\
  \ don't hear. Because what could they possibly say?

SMILER.label=Compulsive Smiler
SMILER.description.0.COMBATANT=Incoming fire? Barry smiles. A brutal melee? He's grinning. No\
  \ one knows if it's nerves, confidence, or just something deeply wrong with him, but when the\
  \ fight gets ugly, his smile only gets wider. His lance isn't sure whether it's reassuring or\
  \ deeply unsettling.
SMILER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry jokes, grins, and cracks a smirk even when things are\
  \ falling apart. "Barry, we're pinned down." Smile. "Barry, command just abandoned us." Grin.\
  \ "Barry, what the hell is so funny?" "Nothing," he says, still smiling. "What else can we do?"
SMILER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't feel like smiling-he has to. The moment he stops,\
  \ the moment his face falls, it all becomes real. The losses, the hopelessness, the sheer weight\
  \ of it all. So he keeps grinning, even when his hands shake, even when there's blood on his\
  \ teeth. Because if he stops, what's left?
SMILER.description.0.SUPPORT=Supplies are running low, requests are piling up, another\
  \ detachment isn't coming back-but Barry's still smiling. "Don't worry, we'll figure it out," he\
  \ says, flashing a grin that's just a little too forced. No one believes him.
SMILER.description.1.SUPPORT=Broken equipment, impossible deadlines, an infuriating lack of\
  \ cooperation-Barry just smiles through it all. "Barry, you're really calm about this." "Oh,\
  \ absolutely," he says through clenched teeth, his grin unwavering as he contemplates murder.
SMILER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry grins even when the walls are closing in, even when the\
  \ company's debts are unpayable, even when another casualty report crosses his desk. "You're\
  \ always smiling," someone says. "Yeah," Barry replies, still grinning. "Because what happens if\
  \ I stop?"

SNACKS.label=Always Has a Snack
SNACKS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry fights like a professional, but he eats like it's just as\
  \ important. Mid-mission? Ration bar. Briefing? Dried fruit. In the scrum? Protein paste. His\
  \ squad used to think it was weird-until they hit a 16-hour engagement and realized he was the\
  \ only one still functioning.
SNACKS.description.1.COMBATANT="Barry, how are you eating right now?" someone shouts as\
  \ bullets whiz overhead. "Gotta keep my energy up," he replies, taking another bite of something\
  \ that definitely shouldn't have survived this long in a combat zone. No one understands how he\
  \ does it-but he never runs out.
SNACKS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry eats because it's routine. Because it's something normal\
  \ in a world that isn't. Because if he focuses on unwrapping a snack, just for a moment, it's not\
  \ about the bodies, the losses, the blood. It's just food. And if he stops? He might start\
  \ feeling everything else.
SNACKS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry is personally stocked for any situation. "Long shift?\
  \ Here, have a protein bar." "Supply delay? I planned for that." His pockets are full of snacks,\
  \ and if you need one, he's got you covered.
SNACKS.description.1.SUPPORT=Explosions outside? Critical system failures? Late-night\
  \ emergency job requests? Doesn't matter-Barry's still eating. "How can you think about food\
  \ right now?" someone asks. He shrugs, chewing. "Because starving won't fix it either."
SNACKS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry always eats, even when no one else can stomach it. He\
  \ chews as he signs off another casualty report. He nibbles on dried meat as he calculates supply\
  \ losses. Because if he keeps eating, keeps living like normal, then maybe-just maybe-things\
  \ aren't as bad as they look.

STORYTELLING.label=Compulsive Storytelling
STORYTELLING.description.0.COMBATANT="This reminds me of the time we got stuck on an ice world with\
  \ no working weapons and one functional radio..." Barry launches into another tale mid-battle,\
  \ dodging fire as he talks. His squad swears he'd narrate his own death if given the chance.
STORYTELLING.description.1.COMBATANT="You ever hear about the merc who took down a 'Mech\
  \ bare-handed?" Barry asks, grinning. "No? Well, let me tell you..." He exaggerates just enough to\
  \ keep things entertaining - but never enough to be sure he's lying.
STORYTELLING.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just tell stories - he preserves them. The names of\
  \ fallen comrades, the battles no one recorded, the choices that led to who lived and who didn't.\
  \ If he keeps talking, if he keeps telling, then maybe they're not really gone.
STORYTELLING.description.0.SUPPORT="You want more food? That reminds me - back in the Skye conflict,\
  \ a guy exactly like you asked for extra rations. You know what happened next?" By the time Barry\
  \ hands over the request, the poor soldier's heard a five-minute anecdote.
STORYTELLING.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry narrates everything. "This reminds me of a time we had a\
  \ busted coolant line exactly like this - except that time, the guy next to me caught fire..." His\
  \ coworkers have learned to just let him talk.
STORYTELLING.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry collects tales of the past - because someone has to. The\
  \ contracts lost, the MechWarriors who never came back, the deals that went south. If he stops\
  \ talking, if he stops telling these stories, it'll be like they never existed at all. And he\
  \ refuses to let that happen.

STRETCHING.label=Constantly Stretching
STRETCHING.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's always stretching - before a mission, during briefings,\
  \ even mid-battle. "A stiff body's a slow body," he mutters, rolling his shoulders. He treats\
  \ combat like a sport - one wrong movement, one cramp at the wrong time, and it could cost him his\
  \ life.
STRETCHING.description.1.COMBATANT="Barry, we're about to breach the enemy position."\
  \ Pop - crack - stretch. "Yeah, just gimme a sec." His squad groans as he twists his torso, arms over\
  \ his head, preparing like he's about to jog a marathon instead of charge into gunfire.
STRETCHING.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry stretches because it's something to control. Muscles\
  \ loosen, joints adjust, everything works the way it's supposed to. Unlike his past mistakes.\
  \ Unlike the ghosts he keeps running from. His body has to be ready - because if it ever locks up,\
  \ so will he.
STRETCHING.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just handle tasks - he prepares for them. Before\
  \ getting to work, before checking manifests, before signing a single form, he stretches. "Gotta\
  \ stay loose," he says, rolling his neck before approving a basic request.
STRETCHING.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry never stops moving. "You good, Barry?" "Yup, just\
  \ loosening up." Pop. Crack. He's so used to stretching that his coworkers suspect he'd cramp up\
  \ instantly if he ever stopped.
STRETCHING.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just stretch - he needs to. The stress, the\
  \ exhaustion, the pressure - his body takes it all in. So he moves, keeps things loose, because if\
  \ his joints lock up, he might realize just how much damage he's actually taken.

SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.label=Suspicious Rituals
SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.0.COMBATANT=Before every mission, Barry finds a quiet spot, kneels, and\
  \ draws something into the dirt. If no dirt is available, he scratches it into metal plating or\
  \ marks it with a grease pen. No one knows what the symbol means, and when asked, he just shrugs.\
  \ "Keeps me alive," he says. The squad isn't sure if he's joking.
SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry spits exactly once outside the DropShip before entering\
  \ it, rubs the underside of his helmet before a firefight, and always, always makes a quick,\
  \ unreadable mark on his harness before booting up. No one has ever seen him forget one of these\
  \ rituals. And the one time someone tried to mess with them? The mission went horribly wrong.
SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't know where he picked up his habits, only that\
  \ they have to be done. Before every mission, he mutters phrases in a language that isn't his,\
  \ pockets a bullet casing from the last fight, and refuses to eat or drink in the last hour\
  \ before deployment. "What happens if you stop?" someone asks. Barry just stares at them for an\
  \ uncomfortably long time before replying, "We don't want to find out."
SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just sign off on jobs - he walks around his\
  \ workstation three times first, knocks on it in a very specific pattern, and occasionally sniffs\
  \ the air before nodding. "Standard procedure," he says. It's not.
SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry won't do anything unless he first taps the console twice\
  \ with the back of his knuckles and places a single unspent round on top of it. He moves the\
  \ bullet only when the job is finished. "It's for luck," he explains. "Whose?" someone asks. He\
  \ doesn't answer.
SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry follows strict steps before finalizing reports - he burns a\
  \ single sheet of scrap paper, scratches a tally mark onto the corner of his desk, and whispers\
  \ something no one quite hears. His coworkers joke about it, but when someone skipped a step for\
  \ him once, a job went catastrophically wrong. Barry never raised his voice. He just  shook his\
  \ head and said, "Told you."

SUPERVISED_HABITS.label=Highly Supervised Habits
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry never enters battle without running the exact same\
  \ pre-mission checks, always in full view of at least one superior officer. If no one's watching?\
  \ He won't start. "Regulations," he says when questioned. No one can find those regulations\
  \ anywhere, but that doesn't stop him.
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's gear logs, movement reports, and even meal schedules\
  \ are always reviewed by someone higher up. He pretends not to notice, but he does. If he\
  \ deviates even slightly from his routine, a quiet note appears in his file. He has no idea\
  \ why - but he makes sure to follow protocol exactly anyway.
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry used to wonder why he had to log his every action. Why he\
  \ had to check in with command even for minor tasks. Why his reports were always cross-checked\
  \ against surveillance logs. But he stopped asking questions when he saw what happened to the\
  \ last guy who didn't follow procedure.
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's logs are double-checked, his reports personally\
  \ reviewed by command, and every one of his transactions requires approval. "It's just standard\
  \ oversight," they tell him. "Sure," he mutters, stamping another form while his every action is\
  \ quietly noted.
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just log his hours - he knows his workstation is\
  \ monitored, his comms are recorded, and his tasks are reported up the chain. If someone asks\
  \ why, he shrugs. "It's just how things work around here." It wasn't always like this.
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry can't step out of line, not even a little. The last time\
  \ he took one shortcut, he got called into a very quiet meeting. Nothing was said outright, but\
  \ he got the message. So now? Now he follows the rules exactly. Because if he slips up again,\
  \ he's not sure if he'll be allowed to come back.

TECH_TALK.label=Incessant Tech Talk
TECH_TALK.description.0.COMBATANT="Barry, is everything ready?" "Well, technically, the\
  \ tolerances are within acceptable limits, but I noticed a slight oscillation in the gyroscopic\
  \ feedback loop, so I recalibrated the - " "Barry, can you fight?" "...Yes."
TECH_TALK.description.1.COMBATANT="Barry, shoot that target!" "Hold on, I'm recalculating the\
  \ heat dispersion rate. If I fire now, the dissipation curve - " BOOM. Someone else takes the shot.\
  \ "Or we could just shoot it, Barry." He sighs. "Fine, but I had a better solution."
TECH_TALK.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just talk tech - he hides in it. Talk about\
  \ casualties? He pivots to weapon diagnostics. Discuss a lost battle? He starts breaking down\
  \ armor slag statistics. The moment he stops analyzing specs and stats, the reality of war starts\
  \ creeping in.
TECH_TALK.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry never simplifies. "It's a simple fix, right?" someone\
  \ asks. "Well, that depends on your definition of 'simple.' You see, the underlying mechanical\
  \ factors - " At some point, people stop listening and just wait for him to finish.
TECH_TALK.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry isn't just good at his job - he insists everyone understand\
  \ exactly why. Checking inventory? He's explaining supply chain inefficiencies. Running a\
  \ diagnostic? You're getting a lesson on system architecture. Adjusting equipment? Better settle\
  \ in for a thesis-level discussion on biometrics. "Barry, we just need it to work." "Yes, but\
  \ don't you want to know why it works?"
TECH_TALK.description.2.SUPPORT=People die. Battles are lost. War is chaos. But numbers? Numbers\
  \ don't lie. Systems work or they don't. Data doesn't betray you. Barry clings to his tech talk\
  \ not because he loves it - but because it's predictable. Unlike everything else around him.

TECHNOPHOBIA.label=Phobia of Technology
TECHNOPHOBIA.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry keeps his targeting HUD off as often as possible, swears\
  \ by manual firing overrides, and refuses to rely on automated systems. "You trust that garbage?"\
  \ he scoffs as his lance syncs their helmets to command relays. "That's how you die - trusting some\
  \ piece of code over your own instincts."
TECHNOPHOBIA.description.1.COMBATANT="You think your helmet's safe? Ha. Ever read about feedback\
  \ seizures? That 'Mech''s auto-ejection system? Kills more people than it saves." Barry distrusts\
  \ every technological convenience, always assuming something is about to go catastrophically\
  \ wrong. The terrifying thing? He's not always wrong.
TECHNOPHOBIA.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just distrust technology - he despises it. He's\
  \ seen MechWarriors suffocate from malfunctioning life support systems, watched targeting\
  \ software glitch and send friendly fire downrange. People think war kills soldiers. Barry knows\
  \ the truth: technology is just waiting to finish the job.
TECHNOPHOBIA.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry refuses to rely on digital records, still handwrites\
  \ reports, and triple-checks every automated system by hand. "What happens when the system\
  \ crashes?" he asks, tapping his paper records. "I'll still know where everything is. Will you?"
TECHNOPHOBIA.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry hates technology. "You think this reactor is stable?\
  \ Please. The second one capacitor misaligns, boom - you're space debris." He's the best at his\
  \ job, but he's also convinced everything remotely high tech is secretly trying to kill everyone.
TECHNOPHOBIA.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't fear technology because he doesn't understand\
  \ it - he fears it because he understands it too well. He's seen what happens when an IFF\
  \ controlled turret malfunctions, when a faulty suit seal dooms a pilot to vacuum, when a simple\
  \ software patch bricks a JumpShip's entire navigation. Technology doesn't fail quietly. It fails\
  \ with screams.

THESAURUS.label=Uses Obscure Words
THESAURUS.description.0.COMBATANT="We should establish a more oblique approach vector; otherwise,\
  \ we'll be in a tactically unenviable position." Barry's lance stares. "Barry. Just say go\
  \ left." He sighs. "Fine. Go left."
THESAURUS.description.1.COMBATANT="Deploy to the interstitial zone before the enemy enacts an\
  \ envelopment maneuver." "Barry, what?" "Move to the alley before they surround us!" His squad\
  \ has learned that when Barry starts using big words, they need to move fast - even if they don't\
  \ fully understand why.
THESAURUS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry refuses to let war reduce him to grunts and curses. He\
  \ speaks in layered, precise language because it reminds him that he's still human. That he's\
  \ still thinking. Because the moment he starts speaking like the others - like a killer - he knows\
  \ there's nothing left to save.
THESAURUS.description.0.SUPPORT="Barry, do we have any spare mark-3s?" "Ah, you seek\
  \ thermoregulatory mitigation apparatuses? Let me peruse the inventory compendium." "...So, is that\
  \ a yes?" "Indubitably."
THESAURUS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just do his job - he narrates it with unnecessarily\
  \ complicated words. "The logistical stratification of these assets necessitates a nuanced\
  \ redistribution methodology." "Barry, just say we need to move some crates." "But that lacks\
  \ precision."
THESAURUS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't say "task failed." He says "the structural\
  \ integrity of the asset has reached an unrecoverable threshold." He doesn't say "the unit is\
  \ dead." He says "we have experienced an irreversible personnel attrition event." If he speaks\
  \ clinically enough, maybe the horror won't feel real.

THIRD_PERSON.label=Speaks in Third Person
THIRD_PERSON.description.0.COMBATANT="Barry doesn't like this. Barry thinks this is a bad plan." His\
  \ squad groans. "Barry, you are Barry." He shrugs. "Barry's aware of that. Barry still thinks you\
  \ should reconsider before Barry has to explain why Barry was right."
THIRD_PERSON.description.1.COMBATANT="Barry is moving to cover now. Barry is reloading. Barry would\
  \ appreciate it if someone covered Barry while Barry does this." His squad has learned that if\
  \ Barry suddenly stops narrating himself, something has gone very wrong.
THIRD_PERSON.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry speaks about himself like he's not really there. Like\
  \ he's just watching a story play out where Barry fights, Barry kills, Barry survives while\
  \ others don't. Because if he doesn't think of himself as part of it, maybe it won't feel so real.
THIRD_PERSON.description.0.SUPPORT="Barry appreciates your patience. Barry is considering your\
  \ request. Barry will now take a moment to think." He speaks like he's playing a role in a script\
  \ only he knows. People have stopped asking why - Barry wouldn't explain anyway.
THIRD_PERSON.description.1.SUPPORT="Barry is noticing some inconsistencies. Barry is wondering if\
  \ anyone else sees this. Barry suspects they do not." It's unclear if Barry thinks he's adding\
  \ dramatic weight to his words or if this is just how he talks now.
THIRD_PERSON.description.2.SUPPORT="Barry will remember this." "Barry thinks this is a mistake, but\
  \ Barry isn't in charge." "Barry understands why this is happening, but Barry doesn't have to\
  \ like it." He doesn't say I because I means he has to accept he's part of it.

TIME_MANAGEMENT.label=Obsessed with Time Management
TIME_MANAGEMENT.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just plan missions - he schedules them down to the\
  \ second. "If we're not moving in ten seconds, we're already behind." His squad groans, but when\
  \ his precision means the difference between making an ambush or falling into one, they stop\
  \ arguing.
TIME_MANAGEMENT.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry counts everything. The seconds between artillery strikes,\
  \ the delay in enemy response times, the precise moment to duck before an incoming shot. His\
  \ squad used to think it was a weird habit - until they realized he never mistimes a move.
TIME_MANAGEMENT.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just track time - he dreads it. Every mission is\
  \ another countdown, every day is another mark closer to an inevitable, unspoken deadline. He\
  \ schedules things not because he likes order, but because he's terrified of how little control\
  \ anyone really has.
TIME_MANAGEMENT.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's personal planner is a masterpiece of\
  \ efficiency - color-coded, cross-referenced, down to the minute. "I'm ahead of schedule," he\
  \ mutters proudly, before immediately finding a new task to stay that way.
TIME_MANAGEMENT.description.1.SUPPORT="I have precisely four minutes for this discussion." "I planned\
  \ for this to take ten minutes, and now it's taking eleven. I don't not approve." His fixation\
  \ on deadlines is impressive, frustrating, and sometimes a little scary.
TIME_MANAGEMENT.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just track time - he hoards it. Every lost minute\
  \ is another missed opportunity, another delay that could mean something worse later. He moves\
  \ fast, plans faster, because slowing down means acknowledging what time is really counting down\
  \ to.

TINKERER.label=Compulsive Tinkerer
TINKERER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's weapons, armor, and equipment are always in pieces,\
  \ even when there's nothing wrong with them. He insists he's "just improving performance," but\
  \ his squad has caught him reassembling a perfectly functional radio just because something felt\
  \ off.
TINKERER.description.1.COMBATANT=Standard-issue gear? Not a chance. Barry's sidearm has a\
  \ custom grip, his biometrics system runs on a personally adjusted algorithm, and no one quite\
  \ understands what he did to his HUD. His mods usually work - until they don't.
TINKERER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry keeps his hands busy with wires, screws, and tools\
  \ because if he stops, his mind wanders. Machines are simple. Machines make sense. Unlike the\
  \ battlefield, unlike war, unlike the choices he's made. If he can fix one more thing, maybe he\
  \ won't feel how much he's already lost.
TINKERER.description.0.SUPPORT=Even if something is running perfectly, Barry is convinced it\
  \ can be better. He reconfigures systems, fine-tunes settings, and makes adjustments that most\
  \ people never notice - but he does. And it bothers him if he doesn't tweak it.
TINKERER.description.1.SUPPORT=If something has moving parts, Barry will take it apart. Pens,\
  \ terminals, doors - if it's in front of him long enough, he'll be "just checking something" and\
  \ then suddenly it's in pieces. Most of the time, he puts things back better. Most of the time.
TINKERER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry fixes what's in front of him - tools, systems, useless\
  \ little things - because it's easier than fixing what's actually wrong. The broken supply chain.\
  \ The dwindling resources. The names disappearing from the roster. If he focuses on tweaking\
  \ small things, maybe he won't have to face the fact that some things can't be fixed.

TRUTH_TELLER.label=Habitual Truth-Teller
TRUTH_TELLER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in false hope. "This is a bad plan," he\
  \ says, loading his harness. "We're outgunned, outnumbered, and command doesn't care if we come\
  \ back." His squad groans, but deep down, they know he's right. He always is.
TRUTH_TELLER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't lie, even when he probably should. "You're a\
  \ terrible shot," he tells a rookie after a botched drill. "That flank will collapse in three\
  \ minutes if we don't move now," he warns the commander. No one ever likes what he has to say - but\
  \ ignoring him tends to get people killed.
TRUTH_TELLER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen what happens when people believe comfortable\
  \ lies. The 'easy mission' that turned into a massacre. The 'reinforcements coming' that never\
  \ arrived. He refuses to be part of it. If the truth is ugly, then people need to face it.\
  \ Anything else is just setting up another grave to be filled.
TRUTH_TELLER.description.0.SUPPORT="This system is failing," Barry states flatly. "The numbers\
  \ don't add up. The schedule won't hold. That plan won't work." People hate bringing problems to\
  \ Barry, not because he's wrong, but because he never softens the blow.
TRUTH_TELLER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't deal in 'maybes' or 'it should be fines.' He wants\
  \ facts. If something is a disaster waiting to happen, he'll say so. If someone asks for his\
  \ opinion, they'd better be ready for it. "You want my honest answer? Or the one that won't hurt\
  \ your feelings?" he asks. Either way, they know which one they're getting.
TRUTH_TELLER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't soften words because too many people have died\
  \ believing the wrong ones. False optimism has cost lives. Misleading reports have led to\
  \ disasters. If the truth is brutal, then so be it. At least with the truth, people have a chance\
  \ to prepare for what's coming.

UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.label=Unnecessary Caution
UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry double-checks every safety, scans for traps in places no\
  \ one would bother setting them, and insists on running four different contingency plans before\
  \ stepping onto the DropShip. "Barry, it's a milk run," someone says. "That's what they said\
  \ last time," he mutters, adjusting his harness again.
UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry clears every building like it's booby-trapped, refuses to\
  \ fire unless he's sure it's a clean shot, and won't step forward unless he's positive about\
  \ footing. "We don't have time for this," someone groans. "We don't have time to die stupidly,\
  \ either," Barry shoots back.
UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry isn't just cautious - he's haunted. He remembers the\
  \ comrade who didn't check their six, the officer who rushed in, the mission that went bad\
  \ because someone thought they had more time. If he slows things down, if he takes one extra\
  \ moment, maybe he can stop the next name from being added to the list.
UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.description.0.SUPPORT="Are you sure that's right? Let me check again. Just in case."\
  \ Barry verifies numbers three times, hesitates before confirming decisions, and won't finalize\
  \ anything unless he's completely convinced there's no possible risk. It makes things painfully\
  \ slow, but he's never wrong.
UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry won't sign off on something unless he's checked every\
  \ possible issue, accounted for every variable, and personally confirmed the results. "Just say\
  \ yes, Barry," someone pleads. "Not until I'm sure," he replies, reading over the numbers one\
  \ more time.
UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's paranoia isn't about efficiency - it's about survival.\
  \ He's seen how fast things spiral when someone gets lazy. A rushed approval. A miscalculated\
  \ order. A misfiled name on a casualty report. He checks and rechecks because one mistake can't\
  \ be undone.

UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.label=Unpredictable Speech
UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.description.0.COMBATANT=One moment, Barry is delivering a perfectly detailed\
  \ battlefield analysis, and the next, he's yelling "Engage the left flank! And also, did you\
  \ know horses used to be deployed in early mechanized warfare? Weird, right?" His squad has no\
  \ idea how his brain works, but his plans usually make sense - eventually.
UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.description.1.COMBATANT="Okay, so imagine the enemy is a pack of hungry dogs, and we're\
  \ holding a steak just out of reach - no, wait, bad example, let's say they're a bunch of perfectly\
  \ spherical cows - " "Barry, just tell us the plan." "I am!"
UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's words jump between cold, clinical detachment and\
  \ erratic, almost manic tangents. One second, he's reciting enemy force composition like a\
  \ machine, and the next, he's muttering "Bad luck always comes in threes. It's always threes."\
  \ His squad pretends not to notice.
UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry starts a sentence with "Per my previous assessment, we can\
  \ reasonably expect - " then immediately switches to " - okay, but also, we're totally boned if this\
  \ goes sideways." No one ever knows what version of Barry they're getting.
UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry starts answering a simple question and ends up talking\
  \ about something completely different. "Yes, I have the report. But first, have you ever\
  \ considered how jump travel affects circadian rhythms? Because I was thinking - " At some point,\
  \ his coworkers just nod and hope he circles back.
UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's words don't always line up with his thoughts. Sometimes\
  \ he's too precise, other times his speech spirals into disconnected, looping statements. He\
  \ catches himself repeating things under his breath - things that don't make sense anymore. And\
  \ when people ask if he's okay, he just laughs and says "Define okay."

UNUSUAL_HOBBIES.label=Unusual Hobbies
UNUSUAL_HOBBIES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry spends downtime in ways that don't quite make sense. He\
  \ maps out old battlefields for fun, builds intricate miniature cities out of plastic building\
  \ blocks, or memorizes entire books on obsolete military doctrine. No one understands why - and he\
  \ refuses to explain.
UNUSUAL_HOBBIES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry can perfectly imitate bird calls. He's fluent in ancient\
  \ dialects no one uses anymore. He collects weather patterns from different planets and can\
  \ predict storms better than an actual forecast. His squad laughs - until one of his odd skills\
  \ actually saves their lives.
UNUSUAL_HOBBIES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry carves intricate symbols into his armor, spends hours\
  \ arranging small stones in precise geometric patterns, or obsessively folds paper into strange\
  \ shapes. When asked, he just shrugs. "It keeps my hands busy." No one asks what happens if they\
  \ aren't busy.
UNUSUAL_HOBBIES.description.0.SUPPORT=No one knows how Barry spends his off-hours. One day, he's\
  \ learning obscure board games, the next, he's trying to whistle in perfect harmonic resonance.\
  \ It's never anything useful, but it's always weirdly specific.
UNUSUAL_HOBBIES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry goes through phases. One week, he's obsessively\
  \ researching pre-spaceflight construction techniques. The next, he's teaching himself to track\
  \ footsteps like an ancient hunter. He never sticks with anything for too long, but when he's\
  \ interested in something, he's all in.
UNUSUAL_HOBBIES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry isn't learning these things because they're fun. He's\
  \ learning them because they keep his mind off everything else. It's easier to master pointless\
  \ trivia, to hyper-focus on something no one cares about, than to dwell on the fact that he's\
  \ watching everything around him slowly fall apart.

WATCH.label=Constantly Checking the Time
WATCH.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just check the time - he tracks it. He knows\
  \ exactly how long it's been since deployment, how much time they have until extraction, and how\
  \ late support is running. "Barry, do you have to check your watch every five minutes?" "Yes. And\
  \ you should too."
WATCH.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry keeps his watch synced down to the millisecond. He\
  \ refuses to move before or after his planned schedule, times reloads perfectly, and somehow\
  \ always knows when trouble is about to start. "We've got ninety seconds before this goes to\
  \ hell," he mutters. His squad laughs - until he's exactly right.
WATCH.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry isn't checking the time to stay on schedule - he's counting\
  \ down. How long until the next battle. How long until reinforcements stop coming. How long until\
  \ the company finally collapses. He won't say what he's waiting for, but the way he stares at his\
  \ watch... it's like he already knows.
WATCH.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just check the time - he lives by it. He watches the\
  \ clock constantly, measuring efficiency, tracking deadlines, and staring at people when they're\
  \ even a second late. "You're five minutes behind schedule," he announces. "Barry, stop doing\
  \ that."
WATCH.description.1.SUPPORT=Every task is timed. Every action is scheduled. Barry doesn't\
  \ waste seconds - he counts them. He sighs when people work too slow, taps his fingers impatiently\
  \ when things aren't moving fast enough, and always seems to be running out of time - even when no\
  \ one knows what for.
WATCH.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry is always checking the time, but he never explains why. A\
  \ deadline? A warning? A moment he's dreading? No one asks, because the way he looks at his\
  \ watch - like he's counting down to something only he understands - is unsettling enough.

WEATHERMAN.label=Obsessed with Weather
WEATHERMAN.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just check the forecast - he studies it. He can\
  \ predict how wind speeds affect projectile trajectories, how moisture messes with sensor\
  \ readouts, how cloud cover changes visibility. His squad used to ignore him - until he started\
  \ being right.
WEATHERMAN.description.1.COMBATANT="Storm's rolling in. Humidity's up - expect some weapon misfires.\
  \ Barometric pressure's dropping, which means - " "Barry, can we focus?" He nods but still mutters,\
  \ "Gonna be a cold front in two hours." No one knows why it matters - but he keeps bringing it up\
  \ anyway.
WEATHERMAN.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry can't control the war. He can't control death, orders, or\
  \ who makes it home. But he can control his understanding of the sky. He checks barometers,\
  \ watches wind speeds, tracks pressure shifts - because if nothing else, at least he knows when the\
  \ rain is coming.
WEATHERMAN.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry always has local weather reports, even if he's nowhere\
  \ near the planet's surface. "Cloud cover's thick today." "Wind speeds are up." "Did you know\
  \ this planet has a monsoon season?" No one knows why he's tracking it - but he never stops.
WEATHERMAN.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry won't just answer a question - he'll compare it to the\
  \ weather. "This delay is like a stalled pressure system - frustrating and going nowhere." "Supply\
  \ chains are like jet streams - unpredictable and constantly shifting." He acts like everything\
  \ ties back to the atmosphere.
WEATHERMAN.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry notices when storms form earlier than expected. When the\
  \ wind blows the wrong way. When the rain doesn't come when it should. He doesn't just track the\
  \ weather - he reads it, like it's warning him of something no one else can see.

WHISTLER.label=Frequent Whistler
WHISTLER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry whistles while mounting the DropShip, while advancing\
  \ through enemy fire, while standing over the wreckage of a downed opponent. It's never\
  \ frantic - always slow, steady, calm. His lance isn't sure if it's confidence or insanity, but\
  \ when the whistling stops, they know things have gone very wrong.
WHISTLER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry has a tune for everything. A jaunty whistle during prep,\
  \ a lazy, off-key melody during downtime, and a slow, eerie note when things get tense. No one\
  \ knows where he picks his tunes from, but they always seem uncomfortably fitting for the moment.
WHISTLER.description.2.COMBATANT=The battlefield is loud, but the moments between the noise are\
  \ worse. Barry whistles to fill the void, to drown out the memories of screams and static-filled\
  \ last words. It's not about the tune - it's about making sure there's always something to listen\
  \ to.
WHISTLER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry whistles while walking, while working, while thinking.\
  \ It's never obnoxious, but it's constant. When people ask him to stop, he just grins and says,\
  \ "Didn't even realize I was doing it."
WHISTLER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's whistling is weirdly predictable. Same tune every\
  \ morning. Same three notes while deep in thought. The exact same melody when something is about\
  \ to go wrong. No one knows if it's a habit or if he knows something they don't.
WHISTLER.description.2.SUPPORT=The world is full of noise - orders, gunfire, comms chatter, dying\
  \ words. But Barry's whistle? That belongs to him. It's the one sound in the universe that isn't\
  \ dictated by war, by loss, by duty. And if he ever stops... it means he's finally lost that, too.

WORRIER.label=Persistent Worrier
WORRIER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just think something could go wrong - he's sure of\
  \ it. "The comms will cut out. The terrain is unstable. The enemy definitely has backup waiting."\
  \ Sometimes he's right. Sometimes he's wrong. Either way, he worries enough for the whole squad.
WORRIER.description.1.COMBATANT="What if the LZ is compromised? What if the intel is wrong?\
  \ What if we don't have enough ammo?" Barry's mind never stops calculating risks, even when\
  \ they're already in the fight. His lance tries to reassure him, but the way he keeps checking\
  \ his weapon makes it clear - he's already expecting the worst.
WORRIER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry isn't paranoid. Barry isn't overthinking things. Barry is\
  \ remembering. The last time they rushed in. The last time someone ignored the warning signs. The\
  \ last time he didn't worry enough, and it got people killed. He refuses to make that mistake\
  \ again.
WORRIER.description.0.SUPPORT="That system is overdue for maintenance." "We're cutting it\
  \ close on time." "Has anyone accounted for contingencies?" Barry isn't negative - he's just\
  \ realistic. And when something does go wrong, the first thing people say is, "Barry called it."
WORRIER.description.1.SUPPORT=Even when everything seems fine, Barry worries. "We're ahead of\
  \ schedule, but what if something delays us?" "We have the supplies, but what if demand\
  \ increases?" His coworkers try to calm him down, but he always has one more thing to stress\
  \ about.
WORRIER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry isn't just anxious - he knows something's wrong. Resources\
  \ don't stretch this thin without breaking. Too many people are gone. Too many plans are running\
  \ on hope instead of certainty. He isn't worried about what if - he's worried about when.

WRITER.label=Writes Everything Down
WRITER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry records everything. Enemy formations, terrain details,\
  \ exact timestamps of major events. "Why?" someone asks. He shrugs. "Might be useful later." No\
  \ one knows who he's writing for - but they're pretty sure it's not just him.
WRITER.description.1.COMBATANT=While others check their ammo or catch their breath, Barry\
  \ takes notes. He's been spotted scrawling in a small, battered notebook while under heavy fire.\
  \ His squad jokes that he's writing his obituary. Barry doesn't laugh.
WRITER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry records details obsessively - not for himself, but for\
  \ whoever comes next. If he goes down, he wants the next poor bastard to have every advantage he\
  \ didn't. The way things are going, he doesn't expect to be around to explain it himself.
WRITER.description.0.SUPPORT=If Barry hears it, he writes it down. Conversations,\
  \ instructions, passing comments - everything goes into his notebook. "Do you really need to write\
  \ that?" someone asks. "You really think you'll remember it later?" he replies, already jotting\
  \ something else.
WRITER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just take notes - he takes detailed notes. Dates,\
  \ timestamps, direct quotes. No one knows why he keeps records this obsessively, but when an\
  \ argument breaks out over what was said last week, everyone turns to Barry.
WRITER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry keeps notes on everyone. Who was here, what they did, what\
  \ they said. He's seen too many names disappear from the roster, too many faces fade from memory.\
  \ If no one else remembers, at least his pages will.

BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.label=Constantly Reminiscing
BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.description.0.COMBATANT="This reminds me of a fight we had on Kelenfold. Same terrain,\
  \ same bad odds." Barry always has a story, always a comparison to something before. His lance\
  \ listens - sometimes for wisdom, sometimes just to hear about a time when things weren't so bad.
BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just remember past battles - he lives in them. He\
  \ compares every engagement to something that happened before, as if history is on a loop and\
  \ they're just playing out a rerun. "We've been here before," he mutters. "Not here-here, but\
  \ close enough."
BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry talks about old wars, old missions, old friends.\
  \ Sometimes it's nostalgia. Sometimes it's guilt. Sometimes it's just because if he thinks too\
  \ hard about right now, about everything falling apart, he won't be able to keep going.
BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.description.0.SUPPORT=No matter what's happening, Barry relates it to something that\
  \ came before. "This reminds me of the time we had to pull triple shifts because of a command\
  \ error." "We used to have a system for this - back when things actually worked." He doesn't\
  \ complain - he just remembers.
BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just talk about what's happening now - he always\
  \ finds a way to bring up what used to be. "Things were different before the company got big."\
  \ "You should've seen the old crew - real professionals." It's never clear if he misses the past or\
  \ just refuses to let it go.
BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry clings to memories like they're the last stable thing\
  \ left. The names, the places, the stories - they're all still real as long as he keeps saying them\
  \ out loud. Because if he ever stops talking about the past, he's afraid he'll have to start\
  \ facing the present.

HEAVY_HANDED.label=Heavy-Handed With Equipment
HEAVY_HANDED.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry slaps control panels, kicks unresponsive consoles, and\
  \ reloads his weapons with enough force to make the mechanisms groan. "That's not how you're\
  \ supposed to - " someone starts, only to watch as Barry forces a jammed system back into working\
  \ order through sheer brute insistence.
HEAVY_HANDED.description.1.COMBATANT="Mechs can take a beating. So can pistols. So can this." Barry\
  \ yanks a jammed sidearm free with enough force to nearly break the slide, wrenches a stuck panel\
  \ open with his bare hands, and shoves a power cell into place like he's punching it into\
  \ submission. His squad has learned to hand him the spares.
HEAVY_HANDED.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't care if he's hard on his gear. It'll break. It\
  \ always breaks. So he doesn't treat it gently - he uses it until it fails, then finds something\
  \ else to replace it. He's seen too many things - and people - fall apart to pretend anything is\
  \ built to last.
HEAVY_HANDED.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't handle things - he manhandles them. He types hard\
  \ enough to shake the terminal, closes panels with enough force to make them rattle, and tightens\
  \ bolts to the point where no one else can loosen them again.
HEAVY_HANDED.description.1.SUPPORT=If something isn't working, Barry's first instinct is violence.\
  \ A firm smack, a hard shove, a sharp twist. "That's not how you fix it," someone mutters. Then\
  \ the system boots up, the machine hums to life, or the issue just disappears. No one knows how\
  \ he does it, but it keeps happening.
HEAVY_HANDED.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't have time for delicate fixes or careful handling.\
  \ The system works, or it doesn't. If it breaks, he'll force it to work or move on to something\
  \ that will. He's seen too much, lost too much, to waste time being gentle with something that\
  \ might not even last another day.

RATION_HOARDER.label=Hoarding Rations
RATION_HOARDER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry never trusts supply lines. He's got ration bars stuffed\
  \ in his boots, emergency packs taped onto his helmet, and a hidden stash of canned food\
  \ somewhere in the barracks. "You never know when things go bad," he says. The way he says it\
  \ makes people wonder if he's speaking from experience.
RATION_HOARDER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't waste a single calorie. Every meal is planned,\
  \ every extra bite stored for later. While others celebrate after a mission with a feast, Barry\
  \ quietly pockets leftovers. "Might need it later," he mutters. His lance jokes about it - until\
  \ they're starving behind enemy lines and he's the only one still eating.
RATION_HOARDER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just hoard rations - he protects them. He's seen\
  \ people go without, seen how quickly desperation sets in when food runs out. He never lets\
  \ himself be that vulnerable again. He doesn't care if people think it's paranoia. When the time\
  \ comes, he'll be the one who survives.
RATION_HOARDER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry always has extra. A drawer full of protein bars, a private\
  \ stash of nutrient packs, and a few "just in case" items tucked away where no one thinks to\
  \ check. He never admits to it - until someone else runs out of food, and he casually hands them\
  \ something.
RATION_HOARDER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry eats strategically. He stretches rations, saves portions\
  \ for later, and never assumes there'll be another meal. He's not stingy - he just knows better\
  \ than to believe in a steady supply of anything.
RATION_HOARDER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry hoards food because he's seen what happens when people\
  \ don't have enough. The fear, the desperation, the way alliances shatter over a single meal.\
  \ He'd rather be prepared than be one of the ones begging.

EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.label=Obsessive Manual Reader
EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just use weapons and equipment - he studies them.\
  \ He can quote weight distribution, fire rates, and optimal calibration settings from memory.\
  \ "Barry, just fire the damn thing!" someone shouts. "Not before I confirm its heat efficiency\
  \ tolerances," he replies, flipping through a dog-eared field guide.
EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.description.1.COMBATANT=If there's a standard operating procedure, Barry follows it to\
  \ the letter. If there isn't, he finds one. He once took a minute mid-firefight to check a repair\
  \ guide before rerouting his weapon's coolant lines. His squad swears he must be part-machine\
  \ with how efficiently he processes instructions.
EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.description.2.COMBATANT=War is messy. Orders change. People die. But manuals? Manuals\
  \ are structured, predictable, reliable. Barry reads them obsessively because they offer\
  \ certainty - cold, clinical instructions that don't lie, don't panic, and don't get killed when\
  \ things go wrong.
EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry won't touch anything without consulting the exact\
  \ procedures. "Let's just figure it out," someone suggests. "Or," Barry says, holding up a\
  \ heavily annotated guide, "we could follow the documented process and not break something."
EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry keeps physical copies of manuals even when digital\
  \ versions are readily available. He has a personal archive of reference materials for\
  \ everything - even things he doesn't personally work with. "You never know when you'll need to\
  \ troubleshoot an emergency oxygen scrubber," he insists.
EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry reads every procedure, every emergency guide, every\
  \ outdated manual because he's seen what happens when people don't know what to do. He memorizes\
  \ survival instructions not for if things go wrong - but for when they do.

QUICK_TO_QUIP.label=Quick to Make Jokes
QUICK_TO_QUIP.description.0.COMBATANT=Bullets are flying, alerts are blaring, and Barry is grinning.\
  \ "Well, this is suboptimal," he quips as an enemy round barely misses him. His lance groans, but\
  \ they know - if Barry's still joking, the fight isn't completely lost yet.
QUICK_TO_QUIP.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry never lets a situation stay too serious. "If we die, I\
  \ just want you all to know - I left my coffee machine on." His lance doesn't always appreciate the\
  \ timing, but sometimes, the right joke at the right time is just enough to break the tension.
QUICK_TO_QUIP.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry laughs because if he stops, he might have to actually\
  \ think about what's happening. The losses, the suffering, the weight of everything - it's too\
  \ much. So instead, he cracks another joke, forces another grin, and keeps moving like nothing's\
  \ wrong.
QUICK_TO_QUIP.description.0.SUPPORT=No matter what's happening, Barry finds a way to comment on it.\
  \ "Oh, another system failure? I'm shocked. Truly." His coworkers groan, but when things get\
  \ stressful, his humor is sometimes the only thing keeping them from snapping.
QUICK_TO_QUIP.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry knows when people are tense, and his first instinct is\
  \ always to break the tension with a joke. "Bad news: We're out of supplies. Good news: Now we\
  \ have a valid excuse to take a really long lunch break." It's impossible to stay completely\
  \ miserable around him.
QUICK_TO_QUIP.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry makes jokes because if he stops, everything starts feeling\
  \ too real. He can't fix the shortages, the losses, or the slow collapse of everything they've\
  \ built - but he can make people laugh, even if only for a moment. And sometimes, that's the only\
  \ thing keeping them all from breaking.

TECH_SKEPTIC.label=Distrusts New Technology
TECH_SKEPTIC.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry hates new tech. If it's not field-tested, battle-worn,\
  \ and proven reliable, he wants nothing to do with it. "They say this targeting system improves\
  \ accuracy by 14%," someone says. Barry scoffs. "And I say it's gonna get you killed when it\
  \ glitches at the worst possible moment."
TECH_SKEPTIC.description.1.COMBATANT="Assisted targeting? No thanks. I trust my own aim." Barry\
  \ refuses to rely on advanced systems, opting for manual overrides, old-school tactics, and tech\
  \ he can actually repair himself. His squad mocks his stubbornness - until their fancy gear\
  \ inevitably malfunctions, and Barry's old methods keep him alive.
TECH_SKEPTIC.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry isn't just skeptical - he's haunted by past failures. The\
  \ cutting-edge weapons that jammed, the prototype that failed, the experimental implants that\
  \ fried their users from the inside out. He doesn't hate innovation - he just knows that in war,\
  \ new means untested, and untested means deadly.
TECH_SKEPTIC.description.0.SUPPORT="Why upgrade something that isn't broken?" Barry refuses to\
  \ switch to the newest software, insists on using old tools, and distrusts anything marketed as\
  \ "next-gen." If forced to adopt new tech, he still keeps the old version just in case.
TECH_SKEPTIC.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry won't touch new systems until they've been through hell\
  \ and back. "They say this interface makes things 'more efficient.' Yeah? Let's see how\
  \ 'efficient' it is when it inevitably crashes at the worst time." He's always got a backup plan\
  \ because he's always expecting failure.
TECH_SKEPTIC.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry remembers the computer-controlled security that\
  \ malfunctioned and started targeting friendlies. The automated supply chain that collapsed when\
  \ one bad update corrupted the entire system. The experimental life support module that wasn't\
  \ tested enough. He doesn't avoid new tech because he's stubborn - he avoids it because he knows\
  \ better.

POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.label=Performs Post-Battle Rituals
POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.description.0.COMBATANT=Win or lose, Barry follows the exact same steps after every\
  \ engagement. He cleans his weapon the same way, checks his gear in the same order, and takes a\
  \ deep breath at the same moment in the process. "It's about discipline," he insists. His lance\
  \ suspects it's about something else entirely.
POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry kneels, mutters a phrase in a language no one recognizes,\
  \ and presses his fingers against the barrel of his weapon for exactly five seconds. "What are\
  \ you doing?" someone finally asks. He shrugs. "Making sure we got through this one clean." They\
  \ don't ask again.
POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't know when he started his post-battle rituals. He\
  \ just knows he has to do them. The moment he skips a step - doesn't wipe down his helmet, doesn't\
  \ trace the same pattern onto his gauntlet, doesn't whisper whatever it is he whispers - is the\
  \ moment he's afraid the war will finally swallow him whole.
POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.description.0.SUPPORT=After every engagement, Barry follows a precise series of\
  \ actions - even when they aren't necessary. He organizes exactly the same way, rechecks records\
  \ twice, and won't move on until he's completed every part of his routine. If interrupted, he\
  \ starts over.
POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry won't talk about what happened in the last engagement\
  \ until he's lit a small candle, wiped down his work surface, and written something in a battered\
  \ notebook. "It's just habit," he says. But when someone asks what he writes, he simply closes\
  \ the book and walks away.
POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry can't explain why he does it - why he marks down the names\
  \ of those who fought after every scenario, why he places a small object just so on his desk, why\
  \ he won't leave the room until he's recited a short phrase under his breath. He just knows that\
  \ stopping feels wrong. And in this war, when something feels wrong, it usually means something\
  \ bad is coming.

OVER_COMMUNICATOR.label=Over-Explains
OVER_COMMUNICATOR.description.0.COMBATANT="Barry, is your weapon jammed?" "Technically, it's not a\
  \ jam - it's a partial failure in the ejection mechanism caused by an accumulation of carbon\
  \ scoring, which, if we really want to get into it, is a byproduct of excessive thermal cycling - "\
  \ "Barry, is it jammed?" "...Yes."
OVER_COMMUNICATOR.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just call out enemy movements - he breaks them down\
  \ step by step. "They're flanking left, which makes sense given their formation, but what they\
  \ don't realize is that their advance pattern leaves a small gap in their center-left quadrant,\
  \ which - " "Barry, just shoot them."
OVER_COMMUNICATOR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just explain - he over-explains everything, because\
  \ if he keeps talking, if he keeps analyzing, then he doesn't have to think about the bigger\
  \ picture. The bodies. The losses. The inevitable end. If he stops, he'll have to face it all at\
  \ once.
OVER_COMMUNICATOR.description.0.SUPPORT=No matter the question, Barry's answer comes with a detailed,\
  \ multi-step breakdown. "Barry, can you confirm if the report was sent?" "Yes, and let me walk\
  \ you through the transmission process to ensure you fully understand how the routing system\
  \ prioritizes data packets - " "Barry, just say yes."
OVER_COMMUNICATOR.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry never just answers - he educates. Even if no one asked. "Did\
  \ you know this entire system was originally designed for an entirely different purpose? Well,\
  \ let me explain - " It's easier to let him finish than to try and stop him.
OVER_COMMUNICATOR.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry knows things are spiraling. The war, the company,\
  \ everything. But if he can explain things, if he can make sense of small details, then maybe he\
  \ can convince himself that some part of this universe still makes sense.

FIELD_MEDIC.label=Tends to Perform Medical Aid
FIELD_MEDIC.description.0.COMBATANT="You're bleeding," Barry says flatly. "No, I'm not-" Before the\
  \ argument can finish, he's already wrapping a bandage around the wound with practiced\
  \ efficiency. He's not officially a MedTech, but his lance has learned that refusing his help is a\
  \ waste of time.
FIELD_MEDIC.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't hesitate. Broken nose? Snap - reset. Gunshot wound?\
  \ Bandaged in seconds. He's not delicate, but he's effective. "You can complain about my bedside\
  \ manner after you stop leaking."
FIELD_MEDIC.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry isn't a MedTech, but MedTechs don't always arrive. He's\
  \ seen too many soldiers bleed out because no one knew what to do. So he learned. And now,\
  \ whether it's his job or not, he'll make sure at least one more person makes it out alive.
FIELD_MEDIC.description.0.SUPPORT=No matter where Barry is, he always seems to have bandages,\
  \ antiseptic, or something to stop the bleeding. "How do you always have medical supplies?"\
  \ someone asks. He just shrugs. "People get hurt."
FIELD_MEDIC.description.1.SUPPORT=Someone's got a nasty cut? Barry's already disinfecting it. A\
  \ bad bruise? He's handing over an ice pack. He never makes a big deal out of it, but no one's\
  \ surprised when he turns up with the exact medical supply they need.
FIELD_MEDIC.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't hesitate to help because no one should have to\
  \ wait for care, not if he can do something about it. If he has to be the one to keep people\
  \ patched up, then so be it.

SYSTEM_CALIBRATOR.label=Constantly Calibrates Systems
SYSTEM_CALIBRATOR.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in manufacturer presets. Before every\
  \ mission, he fine-tunes his weapon's targeting sensors, adjusts his harness, and manually tweaks\
  \ his HUD display. "Barry, do you have to recalibrate before every fight?" "Unless you want bad\
  \ readings," he mutters, already adjusting the settings again.
SYSTEM_CALIBRATOR.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry never trusts that things are properly configured. He\
  \ double-checks everything even if nothing seems wrong. His squad rolls their eyes when he\
  \ starts another adjustment... until the one time he actually catches a flaw before it gets someone\
  \ killed.
SYSTEM_CALIBRATOR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry can't control when the enemy attacks, who makes it home,\
  \ or when command makes a terrible call. But he can control his calibrations. He can adjust the\
  \ tolerances, refine the readouts, tune his weapons. If everything is set just right, maybe - just\
  \ maybe - he'll live through one more battle.
SYSTEM_CALIBRATOR.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry never leaves anything at default. If there's a way to\
  \ fine-tune performance, he'll find it. If a system feels even slightly off, he's adjusting it\
  \ before anyone else even notices. "You changed the parameters again?" someone groans. "The old\
  \ settings were inefficient," he replies without looking up.
SYSTEM_CALIBRATOR.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just calibrate things - he obsesses over them. He\
  \ adjusts tolerances, shifts parameters, and tweaks systems down to decimal-point precision.\
  \ "Barry, it was working fine." "Yeah," he says, still adjusting. "But it could be better."
SYSTEM_CALIBRATOR.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry calibrates because he has to. He's seen what happens when\
  \ a system is just a fraction out of sync. If he can stop even one of those failures, he'll keep\
  \ adjusting and maybe his hands will stop shaking.

AMMO_COUNTER.label=Obsessive Counter
AMMO_COUNTER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fire his weapon - he tracks every single shot.\
  \ "Nine left. Two more reloads. Twenty-three hostiles still moving." His lance doesn't always\
  \ appreciate the running tally, but when ammo runs low, Barry's the only one who actually knows\
  \ how much is left.
AMMO_COUNTER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry counts enemy movements, tracks their steps, and notes the\
  \ exact delay between artillery salvos. "That cannon fires every 16.4 seconds," he mutters. "We\
  \ have 3.2 seconds to move." Someone scoffs - until Barry steps out exactly on time, avoiding the\
  \ blast.
AMMO_COUNTER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't count for fun. He counts because it's the only\
  \ thing keeping him grounded. He tracks shots, seconds, distances - anything but the number of\
  \ bodies left behind. The moment he stops counting, he knows he'll have to face those numbers\
  \ too.
AMMO_COUNTER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry counts steps, counts supplies, counts the seconds between\
  \ each transmission ping. If something isn't accounted for, it bothers him. "How many crates were\
  \ moved?" "Forty-six." "You didn't even check." "I know." And he's always right.
AMMO_COUNTER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry tracks everything from the number of times someone taps\
  \ their pen to how many times a door opens in a shift. No one knows why he does it, and even he\
  \ isn't sure anymore. "How many times has that console flickered today?" "Seventeen." "...Barry,\
  \ why?" "Why not?"
AMMO_COUNTER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry can't stop counting. The seconds between system checks,\
  \ the steps between buildings, the number of people who were here yesterday but aren't today. He\
  \ doesn't know what will happen when he loses count, but something deep inside tells him he never\
  \ wants to find out.

BRAVADO.label=Excessive Bravado
BRAVADO.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry never enters a fight quietly. "Two lances of heavy\
  \ 'Mechs? Easy. They should've sent more if they wanted a challenge." He grins like he's\
  \ completely unfazed, even when he definitely should be concerned. The problem? Sometimes he's\
  \ actually good enough to pull it off.
BRAVADO.description.1.COMBATANT="This is fine," Barry says, standing in the open as artillery\
  \ shells rain down. "I've seen worse." He hasn't. He definitely hasn't. But he'll keep up the act\
  \ until either the battle ends or someone physically drags him to cover.
BRAVADO.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry talks big because if he doesn't, someone else will break\
  \ first. He boasts, he laughs, he grins like he's invincible - because if he stops, if he admits\
  \ how bad things really are, the weight of it all might finally crush him.
BRAVADO.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just fix problems - he makes it sound like he's\
  \ pulling off miracles. "You need this report done? Lucky for you, I'm the best there is." "Oh, a\
  \ system malfunction? Give me five minutes and witness greatness."
BRAVADO.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry isn't just confident - he acts like he's single-handedly\
  \ holding the entire operation together. "Without me? This whole thing would fall apart." It's\
  \ unclear if he actually believes it, but he says it so often, others start to wonder if he's\
  \ right.
BRAVADO.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has to act like everything is under control, like he's too\
  \ good to fail. Because if he lets even one crack show, if he even acknowledges how dire things\
  \ are, the whole illusion shatters. So he smirks, flexes, and keeps acting like the universe\
  \ hasn't already stacked the deck against him.

COMBAT_SONG.label=Sings During Engagements
COMBAT_SONG.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry belts out a tune the moment the shooting starts.\
  \ Sometimes it's a classic war ballad, sometimes it's an old drinking song, and sometimes it's\
  \ just wordless humming. It's both comforting and deeply unsettling - especially when his voice\
  \ stays perfectly steady even under heavy fire.
COMBAT_SONG.description.1.COMBATANT=Bullets fly, explosions shake the ground, and Barry? Barry's\
  \ singing. "Barry, why the hell are you singing right now?" someone shouts. "Gotta keep morale\
  \ up!" he yells back - right before nailing a perfect headshot while still holding a tune.
COMBAT_SONG.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry sings because it drowns everything else out. The screams,\
  \ the comm chatter, the sound of his own heartbeat pounding in his skull. If he stops singing,\
  \ that means the battle's over - and that means he has to face whatever's left behind.
COMBAT_SONG.description.0.SUPPORT=While alarms blare and chaos erupts, Barry is whistling a tune\
  \ and getting to work. The DropShip might be on fire, the systems might be failing, but that\
  \ won't stop him from casually humming an old folk song as he works.
COMBAT_SONG.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's voice is steady, unfazed, even when things go sideways.\
  \ He sings because it helps, because someone has to act like everything's still under control.\
  \ "If Barry's still singing," someone mutters, "then maybe we're not totally screwed yet."
COMBAT_SONG.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't even realize when he starts singing. His hands\
  \ move on autopilot, his voice carries through the chaos, and for a moment, it's like nothing's\
  \ wrong. If he keeps singing, he doesn't have to think about the names missing from the roster\
  \ after this is over.

COMMS_TOGGLE.label=Constantly Toggles Comms Channels
COMMS_TOGGLE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry cycles through comms channels like he's flipping through\
  \ music stations. Squad chatter, command directives, even open frequencies - if anyone is talking,\
  \ he's listening. "Barry, stay on our channel!" "I am - mostly."
COMMS_TOGGLE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry has to hear what's going on. Friendly squads, enemy\
  \ signals, background noise - he constantly switches between them. "Gotta stay informed," he says.\
  \ His lance jokes that he probably knows the enemy's dinner plans before they do.
COMMS_TOGGLE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry keeps flipping channels because silence means something\
  \ has gone wrong. Someone's down. A signal's lost. A squad isn't reporting back. He's seen too\
  \ many comms go quiet forever - so he never stops listening, because the moment he does, he might\
  \ miss someone's last words.
COMMS_TOGGLE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry listens to every comms feed. Logistics, operations,\
  \ emergency reports - he jumps between them so fast it's a wonder he actually understands what's\
  \ going on. Somehow, though, he always seems to catch the most important detail just in time.
COMMS_TOGGLE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't eavesdrop - he just happens to hear everything. One\
  \ second he's tuned into maintenance chatter, the next he's listening to high-level command\
  \ discussions. "You're not supposed to be on that channel, Barry." "Then why is it so easy to\
  \ access?"
COMMS_TOGGLE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry listens like he's expecting something. Some warning. Some\
  \ disaster. Some signal that no one else is paying attention to. And when someone asks why he's\
  \ so obsessed with monitoring channels, he just mutters, "Because I don't want to hear nothing."

EJECTION_READY.label=Paranoid About Emergency Systems
EJECTION_READY.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in safety assurances. If something is\
  \ meant to activate in a crisis, he assumes it won't. He constantly checks, double-checks, and\
  \ personally verifies every precaution, because if something can fail, it will.
EJECTION_READY.description.1.COMBATANT="You trust that system? That's cute." Barry always has a backup\
  \ plan, an alternative escape route, or a manual override ready to go. He assumes any warning\
  \ system is too slow, any failsafe is flawed, and that if he doesn't prepare himself, no one else\
  \ will.
EJECTION_READY.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen protections fail, safeguards ignored, and too\
  \ many people put their faith in something that was never properly tested. He doesn't trust\
  \ emergency measures - not because he's paranoid, but because in his experience, they only work\
  \ when you don't actually need them.
EJECTION_READY.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just check emergency protocols - he lives by them.\
  \ If something is supposed to work in a crisis, he personally verifies it. If people aren't\
  \ following procedure, he makes sure they do. Others think he's overreacting - until something\
  \ actually goes wrong.
EJECTION_READY.description.1.SUPPORT="You really believe that alarm will go off when it's supposed\
  \ to? That's... optimistic." Barry treats every emergency system as already broken until proven\
  \ otherwise. If something hasn't failed yet, it's because it hasn't had the chance to.
EJECTION_READY.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen what happens when maintenance gets lazy, when\
  \ procedures are skipped, when the wrong people sign off on safety reports. He doesn't assume\
  \ an emergency system will work - he assumes it won't. And when it doesn't, he won't be the one\
  \ caught off guard.

HAND_SIGNS.label=Uses Elaborate Hand Signals
HAND_SIGNS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just use standard gestures - he's got a whole extra\
  \ layer of silent communication. He signals things that don't need signals, and half the time,\
  \ his lance isn't even sure what he's trying to say. The weird part? He seems to think everyone\
  \ should already know.
HAND_SIGNS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry gives entire tactical briefings with just his hands, even\
  \ when talking would be faster. He insists it's more efficient - except when it isn't. His gestures\
  \ get more exaggerated the more frustrated he is, until it looks like he's orchestrating a silent\
  \ electro-opera.
HAND_SIGNS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just use hand signals as a preference - he relies\
  \ on them. He's seen how noise gives away positions, how a whispered word at the wrong time can\
  \ be the last thing someone says. He signals because it's safer. Because sometimes, speaking at\
  \ all is too dangerous.
HAND_SIGNS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just talk - he narrates with his hands. Simple\
  \ explanations become full-body performances, and anyone talking to him has to watch as much as\
  \ listen. "Are the signals necessary?" someone asks. "They enhance communication," Barry insists,\
  \ while pointing dramatically.
HAND_SIGNS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry insists his elaborate gestures are perfectly clear. They\
  \ are not. He's constantly flashing signals that only he understands, expecting others to follow\
  \ along. "What does this mean?" someone asks, mimicking his motions. "That's obvious," Barry\
  \ scoffs. "It means 'consider alternatives.'"
HAND_SIGNS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen conversations get overheard, plans fall apart\
  \ because someone was listening when they shouldn't have been. He signals because it's safer.\
  \ Because habits save lives. And because sometimes, talking out loud means giving away too much\
  \ to the wrong person.

HATE_FOR_MEKS.label=Harbors a Deep Hatred for Meks
HATE_FOR_MEKS.description.0.COMBATANT="You really think a giant walking target is the best way to\
  \ fight a war?" Barry scoffs. He doesn't trust Mechs, doesn't like Mechs, and won't stop reminding\
  \ everyone that half of history's worst battles were fought with people betting their lives on\
  \ unreliable metal coffins.
HATE_FOR_MEKS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just dislike Mechs - he resents them. The\
  \ destruction, the collateral damage, the way they turn wars into who has the bigger machine\
  \ instead of who actually has skill. "People used to fight with their own hands," he mutters.\
  \ "Now they just let a fusion engine do the killing for them."
HATE_FOR_MEKS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's hatred for Mechs isn't abstract. He's been on the wrong\
  \ side of a Mech's guns, seen cities crushed under metal feet, watched people disappear in a\
  \ flash of energy fire. He doesn't fear Mechs - he despises them.
HATE_FOR_MEKS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry has an opinion, and he'll never stop sharing it. "Mechs\
  \ are inefficient, wasteful, and a logistical nightmare." Whether it's repairs, resource\
  \ consumption, or just the fact that they exist at all, Barry never misses an opportunity to rant\
  \ about why they shouldn't.
HATE_FOR_MEKS.description.1.SUPPORT=If something goes wrong, Barry finds a way to blame it on Mechs.\
  \ Supplies running low? "Because of Mech maintenance costs." Damage to infrastructure? "Because\
  \ some MechWarrior thought they were being tactical." He doesn't care how advanced they get - he\
  \ thinks they're all just walking catastrophes waiting to happen.
HATE_FOR_MEKS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just dislike Mechs - he's seen what they leave\
  \ behind. He's seen men and women turned to slurry by Mech-scale machine guns, counted the losses\
  \ from ammo explosions, and watched the way entire cities break under the weight of Mech warfare.\
  \ He knows Mechs win wars. He also knows the damage they cause.

IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.label=Uses Improvised Weaponry
IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just rely on standard-issue arms - he sees weapons\
  \ everywhere. A loose piece of metal? A makeshift club. A handful of debris? A distraction tool.\
  \ "A gun's nice," he says, "but creativity keeps you alive."
IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't wait for the perfect tool - he adapts. A broken\
  \ piece of equipment? A blunt weapon. A stray cable? A garrote. His squad has seen him turn\
  \ debris into effective tools of survival more times than they can count. "You fight with what\
  \ you have," he says, "not what you wish you had."
IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust ammunition supplies, doesn't expect\
  \ reinforcements, doesn't assume he'll have what he needs when he needs it. He's seen fights last\
  \ longer than the weapons meant to win them. So he's learned to make anything deadly - because he\
  \ refuses to be the one left empty-handed.
IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry has a habit of repurposing things. That wrench? A club.\
  \ That office chair? A barricade. He doesn't go looking for fights, but if one happens, he'll\
  \ immediately size up his surroundings for what can be used in a pinch.
IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't assume safety. If things go bad, he's already\
  \ figured out how to use the tools around him as weapons. He's got a solid grip on that\
  \ clipboard for a reason. And if he's holding a heavy-duty stapler? That's not an accident.
IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't trust in things being available when needed. He's\
  \ seen people die reaching for weapons that weren't there. So he treats everything like it might\
  \ be the only thing standing between him and the worst-case scenario. And if that means turning\
  \ a screwdriver into a weapon, so be it.

PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.label=Believes in Omens
PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just prepare for battle - he reads the battlefield\
  \ before it even starts. A bird flying against the wind? Bad sign. A weapon jam during pre-check?\
  \ Worse. If something feels off, he adjusts his approach immediately. Others call it paranoia,\
  \ but Barry swears it's saved his life before.
PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry has walked away from engagements because the omens were\
  \ wrong. If the sun rises through heavy fog, if the wind shifts in a way that feels unnatural, if\
  \ he dreams of something he'd rather forget - he'll find a way to stall, adjust, or avoid the fight\
  \ entirely. People call him superstitious. He calls them reckless.
PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in luck, but he believes in warnings.\
  \ He's watched people ignore the signs - only for them to never return. A slight misstep, a broken\
  \ routine, a bird call at the wrong time - all dismissed, all followed by disaster. He's done\
  \ trying to convince others. He just hopes he's smart enough to listen when it matters.
PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry hesitates before making decisions if something feels\
  \ wrong. Maybe it's a strange silence, maybe it's a bad dream, maybe it's just a gut feeling. But\
  \ if an omen tells him not to do something, he won't, and he doesn't care how irrational it seems.
PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't need dramatic omens - he picks up on subtle ones. A\
  \ light flickering? A bad sign. A sudden chill in the air? Something's coming. He doesn't always\
  \ say what he expects to happen, but the way he reacts makes it clear - he believes something will.
PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry knows the universe is cruel, that fate doesn't care. But\
  \ omens? Omens give order to the chaos. They tell him when to act, when to wait, when to prepare\
  \ for the worst. Because if he ever stops believing in the signs, he'll have to accept that\
  \ nothing is watching out for them at all.

SILENT_LEADER.label=Silent Leader
SILENT_LEADER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't give speeches. He doesn't bark orders. He moves,\
  \ and people follow. He sees what needs to be done, takes the first step, and - without ever saying\
  \ a word - his squad finds themselves falling in line behind him.
SILENT_LEADER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't need to shout to be heard. A glance, a nod, a\
  \ subtle motion of his hand - it's all the direction his team needs. He rarely explains himself,\
  \ but when he moves with purpose, people trust him enough to follow without question.
SILENT_LEADER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen too many commanders make grand speeches, give\
  \ bold promises - only to watch them die meaningless deaths. He doesn't inspire with words. He\
  \ inspires by surviving, by acting, by doing what has to be done without the need for\
  \ reassurance. Those who follow him don't do it because he tells them to. They do it because he\
  \ keeps them alive.
SILENT_LEADER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't waste time on debates or power struggles. When\
  \ something needs to be fixed, organized, or handled, he just does it. And soon enough, the\
  \ people around him realize they're following his lead without even thinking about it.
SILENT_LEADER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry never asks for recognition, never tries to take control.\
  \ But somehow, his way of doing things always becomes the way things get done. People look to him\
  \ when they're uncertain, even though he never volunteers for leadership.
SILENT_LEADER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't lead because he wants to. He leads because someone\
  \ has to. He's seen what happens when no one steps up, when people hesitate, when leadership\
  \ fails. He speaks when necessary, but most of the time, he just acts. And those who survive\
  \ understand why that's enough.

BATTLE_CRITIC.label=Constant Critic
BATTLE_CRITIC.description.0.COMBATANT=No strategy is ever good enough for Barry. He picks apart every\
  \ formation, every maneuver, every decision. "That's a weak flank. That exit is a death trap.\
  \ This timing is off by at least three seconds." It's exhausting - but more than once, his\
  \ nitpicking has saved lives.
BATTLE_CRITIC.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't care about sparing feelings - he cares about\
  \ survival. If someone makes a bad call, he'll say it outright. If a plan is sloppy, he'll tear\
  \ it apart in real-time. "That was a terrible angle. You barely made that shot." His squad\
  \ complains - until they realize he's making them better.
BATTLE_CRITIC.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust victories. He's seen how overconfidence\
  \ gets people killed, how one unchecked mistake can doom an entire squad. So he criticizes\
  \ everything, no matter how small. Because if people stop improving, they stop surviving.
BATTLE_CRITIC.description.0.SUPPORT=No system, no process, no decision is above Barry's scrutiny.\
  \ "This could be more efficient. That's a terrible use of resources. Who approved this mess?"\
  \ He's relentless - but frustratingly, he's also usually right.
BATTLE_CRITIC.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't let anything slide. He'll call out redundancies,\
  \ inefficiencies, and anything that isn't perfectly optimized. "Oh, we're doing it this way? Bold\
  \ choice. Hope you like fixing it later."
BATTLE_CRITIC.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't criticize to be difficult - he criticizes because he\
  \ knows what happens when details get overlooked. The smallest oversight can spiral into\
  \ catastrophe. If he's harsh, if he's relentless, it's because he's seen how easily things fall\
  \ apart when people stop paying attention.

CHECKS_WEAPON_SAFETY.label=Constantly Performs Safety Checks
CHECKS_WEAPON_SAFETY.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust that things are actually ready unless he\
  \ personally verifies them. Gear, positioning, escape routes - he checks everything twice, then\
  \ once more just in case. "Barry, we're on a schedule." "Yeah? And we're also alive because I\
  \ don't skip steps."
CHECKS_WEAPON_SAFETY.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry expects things to go wrong, so he prepares before they\
  \ do. He inspects equipment, tests redundancies, and always runs his own last-minute diagnostics.\
  \ His squad groans every time he slows them down - until the one time he catches something everyone\
  \ else missed.
CHECKS_WEAPON_SAFETY.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen what happens when people rush. The gear that\
  \ fails, the comms that don't transmit, the backup plans that weren't actually ready when needed.\
  \ He's watched people die from mistakes they never even knew they made. So he checks, and checks\
  \ again - because if he doesn't, no one else will.
CHECKS_WEAPON_SAFETY.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry refuses to sign off on anything until he's gone over it\
  \ personally. "Just approve it, Barry." "Not until I check it first." People call him overly\
  \ cautious, but his work never fails.
CHECKS_WEAPON_SAFETY.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't cut corners. If there's a safety protocol, he\
  \ follows it exactly. If there's an inspection process, he does it in full. People complain, but\
  \ they also know they've never had a preventable failure under his watch.
CHECKS_WEAPON_SAFETY.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry isn't just careful - he's haunted. He's seen shortcuts cost\
  \ lives, seen people trust systems that weren't actually ready. If he seems obsessive, if he\
  \ slows things down, it's because he knows what happens when people assume things are fine. And\
  \ he refuses to let it happen again.

CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.label=Prefers Things Up Close
CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in fighting from afar. He moves in fast,\
  \ cuts down space, and engages up close where he can see the fear in their eyes. "Why keep your\
  \ enemies at a distance when you can make sure they stay down?"
CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry sees long-range engagements as impersonal, inefficient,\
  \ and, worst of all, boring. He thrives where things are fast, brutal, and decided in seconds.\
  \ "If I'm fighting," he says, cracking his knuckles, "I want them to know it was me."
CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't take chances. He's seen enemies get back up when\
  \ people thought they were dead. He's watched someone turn away too soon, only to be caught off\
  \ guard. He fights up close because when he ends something, he makes sure it stays ended.
CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't do passive solutions. If something needs fixing,\
  \ he's right there, hands-on, making sure it's handled properly. He doesn't trust distant\
  \ coordination - he gets in the thick of it.
CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has no patience for discussions from across a room. He\
  \ closes distance, gets right in front of whoever he's talking to, and makes sure they feel the\
  \ weight of his words. It's not aggression - it's just how he operates. But people definitely take\
  \ it that way.
CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry hates distance - not just in fights, but in anything. If\
  \ he's involved, he wants to be right there, in the moment, in control. He's seen what happens\
  \ when you rely on detached solutions. Distance means risk. Distance means failure. And he won't\
  \ allow it.

COMBAT_POET.label=Recites Poetry
COMBAT_POET.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he narrates the moment. Whether it's\
  \ ancient war poetry, battlefield elegies, or lines of verse that no one else recognizes, he\
  \ speaks as if he's seen this all before. "Bent double, we cursed through sludge; till towards\
  \ our distant rest began to trudge."
COMBAT_POET.description.1.COMBATANT=When the fight begins, Barry's voice is calm, rhythmic,\
  \ measured. A stanza here, a line there, whispered into comms like a battle hymn. His lance\
  \ doesn't know whether to be inspired or unsettled. His enemies? They just think he's insane.
COMBAT_POET.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't recite poetry for theatrics. He does it because\
  \ it's how he copes. The right words make chaos feel structured, give meaning to the things he'd\
  \ rather not think about. If he stops speaking, if he stops finding words for the war, then he'll\
  \ have to admit that none of it ever had meaning to begin with.
COMBAT_POET.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just talk - he quotes. Team meetings? A few\
  \ lines about the passing of time. Emergency briefings? Something about the toil of labor.\
  \ Whether anyone appreciates it or not, he has a verse for everything.
COMBAT_POET.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry won't just answer questions - he'll answer them in poetry.\
  \ Sometimes it's his own, sometimes it's old, forgotten texts, and sometimes it's just whatever\
  \ fits the mood. "Barry, can you just say yes?" "I could - but where's the beauty in that?"
COMBAT_POET.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry speaks in poetry because it keeps the emptiness at bay.\
  \ He's seen too many things that don't deserve to be remembered - but somehow, words make them\
  \ bearable. If he stops finding poetry in the world, then all that's left is the cold, empty\
  \ void of everything that's been lost.

CUSTOM_DECALS.label=Obsessed with Custom Decals
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't leave anything plain. Armor, weapons,\
  \ vehicles - everything gets a custom touch. Whether it's hand-painted insignias, personal mottos,\
  \ or intricate symbols only he understands, his gear is always distinctively his.
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's decals aren't random; they mean something. Every\
  \ marking tells a story - some a warning, some a remembrance. When people ask what they mean, he\
  \ gives different answers every time. Maybe they're just for him. Maybe they're for the people\
  \ who won't live to see the next one.
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry knows the war doesn't guarantee survival. But his\
  \ decals? They might last longer than he does. Maybe someone will see them one day, wonder who\
  \ he was, what he fought for. Maybe that's enough. Maybe that's all anyone can really hope for.
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry refuses to let anything be generic. His tools, his\
  \ workstation, even his reports have some kind of personalized insignia. If someone borrows\
  \ something of his, they'll know - because his signature touch is everywhere.
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry treats the unit insignia like a necessary part of life.\
  \ A blank wall? Unacceptable. An untouched case? Needs a mark. Whether it's subtle or elaborate,\
  \ he finds a way to leave the company's insignia on everything he works with.
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry personalizes things because he knows how quickly people\
  \ disappear. How fast their names are forgotten. If he can't control anything else, he can at\
  \ least leave behind something unique. If the war erases everything else, at least someone might\
  \ one day see his mark and remember he existed.

DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.label=Displays Trophies from Past Accomplishments
DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he collects proof of his victories.\
  \ Spent shell casings, pieces of damaged armor, insignias from defeated foes - his personal space\
  \ is covered in relics from past engagements. "You keep all this junk for a reason?" someone\
  \ asks. Barry smirks. "It's not junk. It's history."
DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's trophies aren't just for himself. He keeps them\
  \ visible, a reminder of what he's done and what he's capable of. Some see them as badges of\
  \ honor. Others see them as a warning - a quiet message that Barry isn't someone to be\
  \ underestimated.
DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry keeps trophies not out of pride, but because if he\
  \ doesn't, what was it all for? Every token, every relic is a reminder that he survived, that his\
  \ actions meant something. Without them, everything he's done might as well be forgotten. And\
  \ that's something he refuses to let happen.
DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's workspace is full of personal trophies. Awards,\
  \ certificates, old mission patches - anything that proves he's been here, that he's done something\
  \ worth remembering. If someone asks about them, he'll always have a story ready.
DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just display his accomplishments - he relives them.\
  \ Every object on his shelf, every framed relic has a meaning, a memory. Whether people see them\
  \ as inspiring or self-indulgent, one thing is certain: Barry remembers everything he's done.
DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't collect trophies for vanity. He collects them\
  \ because he knows how quickly people disappear. He's seen names erased, legacies forgotten. If\
  \ he keeps these reminders, maybe someone will remember he was here. Maybe that will be enough.

DO_IT_YOURSELF.label=Obsessive Do-It-Yourselfer
DO_IT_YOURSELF.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust factory settings or off-the-shelf\
  \ solutions. If he's using something, he's modified it himself. "Standard issue? Yeah, no\
  \ thanks." His gear is a patchwork of custom fixes, reinforced parts, and things no one else\
  \ fully understands.
DO_IT_YOURSELF.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry won't wait for specialists. He adjusts his gear, he\
  \ repairs his equipment, and he makes sure everything works his way. "You sure that's safe?"\
  \ someone asks as he rewires a system. "No," Barry says, "but now it actually works."
DO_IT_YOURSELF.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen things fail - equipment breaking when it\
  \ shouldn't, systems failing at the worst possible moment. He doesn't trust standard designs,\
  \ because he's seen what happens when they let people down. If he can build it, fix it, or\
  \ improve it himself, at least he knows who to blame if it fails.
DO_IT_YOURSELF.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in pre-fabricated anything. If there's a\
  \ problem, he builds his own fix. His workspace is filled with half-finished projects, custom\
  \ tools, and modifications that no one else quite understands. "Why use stock solutions when you\
  \ can make something better?"
DO_IT_YOURSELF.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry won't use a tool without tweaking it first. Every system\
  \ he interacts with has some kind of Barry-approved modification. It's not official, but it works\
  \ better now. "You didn't like how it worked, so you just changed it?" someone asks. Barry nods.\
  \ "And now it's right."
DO_IT_YOURSELF.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry customizes everything because he's seen too many things\
  \ fail when they shouldn't. People trust that things will work the way they're designed. Barry\
  \ knows better. If he built it, if he reinforced it, then at least he knows it won't fail the\
  \ moment it's needed most

FIELD_IMPROVISER.label=Improvises with Field Supplies
FIELD_IMPROVISER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't worry about not having the right tools - he makes\
  \ do. A broken weapon, a missing component, an unexpected failure? He's already rigging up a\
  \ solution with whatever he can scavenge. "You'd be amazed what you can build with a little\
  \ ingenuity and a complete lack of better options."
FIELD_IMPROVISER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just prepare - he adapts. If something isn't\
  \ working, he modifies it on the fly. If supplies run out, he finds something else that works.\
  \ "You can carry everything you need," he says, grinning, "or you can just get creative when it\
  \ matters."
FIELD_IMPROVISER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't expect things to be available when needed. Ammo\
  \ runs dry. Equipment fails. Reinforcements don't come. He's learned to use what's around him\
  \ because it's always better than waiting for something that isn't coming.
FIELD_IMPROVISER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry won't stop a task just because he's missing one thing. If\
  \ something's broken, he fixes it with whatever's on hand. If a system isn't cooperating, he rigs\
  \ up a workaround. "Not the cleanest fix," he mutters, "but it works, and that's what matters."
FIELD_IMPROVISER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't wait for official repair parts or standardized\
  \ procedures - he figures something out. Need a replacement component? He'll find one. Can't access\
  \ a system? He'll bypass it. The methods might not be by the book, but somehow, they always work.
FIELD_IMPROVISER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen people fail because they waited for the proper\
  \ tools or the right conditions. He's seen how fast things go wrong. So he never assumes he'll\
  \ have what he needs. He just makes things work - because the alternative is losing everything\
  \ while waiting for something that will never arrive.

LOUD_COMMS.label=Uses Loud Comms
LOUD_COMMS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's voice booms over comms, whether it's necessary or not.\
  \ "I SAID LEFT FLANK - ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING?" He insists it's for clarity, but his lance is\
  \ pretty sure their eardrums are suffering more than the enemy.
LOUD_COMMS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just issue orders - he broadcasts them like a\
  \ declaration of war. If the enemy wasn't listening before, they definitely are now. His squad\
  \ isn't sure if it's intimidation or recklessness, but one thing's for sure: he's impossible to\
  \ ignore.
LOUD_COMMS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry hates silence. He's seen comms go dead before - heard the\
  \ static where voices used to be. So he shouts, he yells, he forces noise into the\
  \ channel - because if he's still hearing responses, then at least someone is still alive.
LOUD_COMMS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't do quiet radio chatter. His voice comes through\
  \ clear, sharp, and way too loud. "CONFIRMING STATUS - DO YOU COPY?" Even when no one needs him to\
  \ be that loud, he does it anyway.
LOUD_COMMS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's comms volume is permanently set to maximum. Whether he's\
  \ giving an update, issuing a routine report, or just checking in, it's like he's trying to reach\
  \ someone five jumps away. "Barry, we can hear you just fine." "GOOD."
LOUD_COMMS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's been on channels that have gone quiet. Too quiet. The\
  \ kind of quiet that means something's gone very wrong. So he keeps his voice loud, his comms\
  \ open, his presence unignorable. Because if the signal ever drops, if the voices ever cut out,\
  \ he knows exactly what that means.

WAR_STORIES.label=Overly Fond of War Stories
WAR_STORIES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry has a story for every situation. "This reminds me of that\
  \ time on New Aragon - similar terrain, same terrible odds, and guess what? We made it through that\
  \ one too." His lance isn't sure whether he's boosting morale or just reliving his favorite\
  \ moments.
WAR_STORIES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's stories are legendary, but also suspect. One day, it's\
  \ a tale of him holding off an entire battalion with nothing but a sidearm. The next, he's\
  \ outdriving an artillery barrage on foot. His squad humors him, but no one's ever seen any\
  \ records to back them up.
WAR_STORIES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry tells stories not because they're entertaining, but\
  \ because he refuses to let people be forgotten. He speaks of old battles, fallen comrades,\
  \ places that don't exist anymore. He remembers so that others won't have to. Or maybe, because\
  \ he knows no one else will.
WAR_STORIES.description.0.SUPPORT=No matter what's happening, Barry can connect it to something\
  \ he saw, heard about, or was totally involved in. "Supply problems? Ha! Back on Trellwan, we ran\
  \ an entire op on half-rations. Let me tell you - " Everyone knows once he starts, it's impossible\
  \ to stop him.
WAR_STORIES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just tell war stories - he lives them, relives\
  \ them, makes them part of everything he does. He references past battles like they're life\
  \ lessons, dropping names of people no one else remembers. To him, the past isn't just the\
  \ past - it's the foundation of everything now.
WAR_STORIES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry keeps telling the same war stories because he knows one\
  \ day, there won't be anyone left who remembers them. He describes battles in vivid detail,\
  \ speaks the names of the dead like a prayer, and acts as if saying them out loud is the only\
  \ thing keeping them real. Maybe it is.

ALL_OR_NOTHING.label=All or Nothing
ALL_OR_NOTHING.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't hesitate. He fights with everything or not at\
  \ all. If he's going in, he's committed, and he expects everyone else to be the same. "We don't\
  \ half-win fights," he growls. "We either walk away or we don't."
ALL_OR_NOTHING.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in measured risks. He doesn't pull back,\
  \ doesn't hold back, and never takes a fight expecting to retreat. "If you're already in, then be\
  \ all in." He's either the first in the fight or the last one standing. There is no middle ground.
ALL_OR_NOTHING.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry commits fully to every action because he's seen what\
  \ happens to people who hesitate. The ones who second-guess, who try to find a safer option, who\
  \ hesitate at the wrong moment - they don't survive. So he doesn't stop. He doesn't hesitate. He\
  \ just goes.
ALL_OR_NOTHING.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't do halfway. If he's assigned a task, it's getting\
  \ done completely - to the best possible standard. If he doesn't think it's worth doing right, he\
  \ won't do it at all. "It's either perfect, or it's garbage," he mutters, redoing something for\
  \ the third time.
ALL_OR_NOTHING.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just commit - he overcommits. If he's fixing\
  \ something, it's getting rebuilt from scratch. If he's preparing for a job, he's triple-checking\
  \ everything. "You don't need to go that far," someone says. Barry just shrugs. "If you're doing\
  \ something, why not do it completely?"
ALL_OR_NOTHING.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in partial effort because he's seen how\
  \ easily things fall apart. The almost-finished defenses that didn't hold. The half-prepared\
  \ plans that led to disaster. He either does things fully, or he doesn't do them at all - because\
  \ anything in between is just waiting for failure to happen.

BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.label=Prefers Grounded Tactics
BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust high-level strategies or overcomplicated\
  \ maneuvers. He believes victory comes from direct control, from positioning, from knowing\
  \ exactly what's happening in the fight - not from a distant command center. "You want to win? Get\
  \ your hands dirty and see the fight yourself."
BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't put faith in big-picture strategies. He focuses\
  \ on where he is, who he's with, and what's in front of him. He's more interested in terrain,\
  \ cover, movement - things that actually decide a battle. "Grand strategies are great until\
  \ someone's got a knife at your throat."
BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen how large-scale strategies sacrifice the people\
  \ actually fighting. He's seen plans drawn up by those who never have to bleed for them. He\
  \ trusts what's real, what he can see, what he can control. Because he knows that when things go\
  \ wrong, it's not the planners who suffer - it's the ones actually in the fight.
BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't waste time on high-level theories. He cares about\
  \ what actually works, what affects people on the ground. If a plan doesn't hold up in real\
  \ conditions, he won't even consider it. "Looks great on paper. Means nothing if it doesn't work\
  \ down here."
BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in complicated tactics. If something can't\
  \ be explained in one sentence, he doesn't trust it. He values direct execution over drawn-out\
  \ planning and believes the simplest strategies are usually the ones that actually succeed.
BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen plans fail because they were designed too far\
  \ from the action. He's seen people die following strategies that didn't account for real\
  \ conditions. He only trusts what can be seen, tested, and done in the moment - because that's what\
  \ actually decides who lives and dies.

BRAVERY_BOASTER.label=Boasts About Bravery
BRAVERY_BOASTER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry always has a story about the time he stood his ground\
  \ against impossible odds. Whether it was charging into fire, refusing to retreat, or staring\
  \ down a superior force without blinking - he makes sure everyone knows about it. "You think this\
  \ is bad? Let me tell you about the time I - "
BRAVERY_BOASTER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry acts like fear is something other people experience. He\
  \ tells stories loudly, emphasizing every detail of how he stood firm when others might have run.\
  \ Whether it's completely true or not? Well, that depends on who's asking.
BRAVERY_BOASTER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry tells and retells his tales of bravery because he needs\
  \ them to matter. He needs people to see him as fearless, as someone who never wavered, as\
  \ someone worth remembering. Because deep down, he knows that in war, the forgotten are already\
  \ dead.
BRAVERY_BOASTER.description.0.SUPPORT=No matter what the situation is, Barry has a bravery story to\
  \ match. "Dangerous? Hah! You should've seen the time I - " It doesn't matter what's happening - he\
  \ always has a tale of personal valor ready to share.
BRAVERY_BOASTER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry treats even minor incidents like acts of heroism. He\
  \ recounts how he bravely handled a malfunctioning system, how he stood firm during a minor\
  \ crisis, how he didn't even flinch when things went south. It might be over-the-top, but it's\
  \ hard not to admire the confidence.
BRAVERY_BOASTER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just tell stories - he builds a legend. He's seen\
  \ too many people fade into history, forgotten as just another name on a list. So he makes sure\
  \ his bravery is known, repeated, and impossible to ignore. Because in war, being remembered is\
  \ the only way to live forever.

COCKPIT_DRIFTER.label=Daydreams
COCKPIT_DRIFTER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's mind wanders at the worst possible times. Mid-mission,\
  \ mid-firefight, even while waiting for an enemy to make a move - he's caught staring into the\
  \ distance, lost in thought. "Barry, focus!" someone shouts. He blinks, snapping back. "Yeah,\
  \ yeah - I was just thinking."
COCKPIT_DRIFTER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry fights hard, but his mind is elsewhere. He dreams about\
  \ what he'd do if he weren't here, imagines different places, different battles, different\
  \ endings. Sometimes, he wonders if he'll ever get to see any of them.
COCKPIT_DRIFTER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't drift off because he's careless - he does it\
  \ because he needs to escape. If he stays too present in the moment, the weight of everything - of\
  \ war, of loss, of survival - might finally break him. So he lets himself slip away, just for a\
  \ moment, to somewhere better.
COCKPIT_DRIFTER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry can be in the middle of a conversation, a report, or an\
  \ important check - and then, suddenly, he's somewhere else entirely. Staring into space, fingers\
  \ idle, completely gone until someone snaps him back. "Barry, did you hear anything I just\
  \ said?" "Uh... most of it?"
COCKPIT_DRIFTER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has an entire universe in his head. Sometimes he's\
  \ reminiscing, sometimes he's planning, and sometimes... well, even he's not sure where he just\
  \ went. "What are you thinking about?" someone asks. Barry blinks. "Oh, uh. Stuff."
COCKPIT_DRIFTER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry lets his mind wander because the alternative is staring\
  \ reality in the face for too long. When supplies run low, when losses pile up, when everything\
  \ feels like it's crumbling - sometimes, the only way to keep moving is to imagine something other\
  \ than this.

CONSPIRACY_THEORIST.label=Believes in Conspiracy Theories
CONSPIRACY_THEORIST.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust anything at face value. Every mission has\
  \ another layer, every battle is part of some bigger scheme. "You think this is just a simple\
  \ engagement? Please. Someone up top is pulling the strings - we just don't know why yet."
CONSPIRACY_THEORIST.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry connects everything to a larger plot. If an enemy force\
  \ is moving strangely, if supply lines are disrupted, if things just feel off - he has a theory. It\
  \ might be paranoia, but every now and then, he's right, and that's the most dangerous part.
CONSPIRACY_THEORIST.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen too many warriors die for no reason, seen\
  \ decisions made that make no sense unless someone in command is playing a bigger game. He\
  \ doesn't just suspect conspiracies - he knows they exist. He just hasn't figured out who's really\
  \ behind them yet.
CONSPIRACY_THEORIST.description.0.SUPPORT=A system crash? Sabotage. A delayed shipment? Intentional supply\
  \ manipulation. A bad weather pattern? They're controlling it. Barry always has a conspiracy\
  \ theory, and it's never just an accident.
CONSPIRACY_THEORIST.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just believe in conspiracies - he's trying to wake\
  \ everyone else up. "You think it's just bad luck? That's what they want you to think." He has\
  \ charts, data, and an alarming amount of unofficial sources to back up his claims. "Wake up,\
  \ sheeple!"
CONSPIRACY_THEORIST.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen what happens to people who don't ask questions.\
  \ He's watched things disappear, people vanish, records rewritten. He doesn't just think someone\
  \ is hiding something - he knows. The problem is, the deeper he digs, the more he starts to wonder\
  \ if he's better off not knowing at all.

DEVOUT_WARRIOR.label=Warrior's Code Devotee
DEVOUT_WARRIOR.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't fight just to win; he fights the right way. He\
  \ has rules, a code, a line he won't cross - even if it would make things easier. "Honor matters,"\
  \ he says. "Without it, we're just killers in metal coffins."
DEVOUT_WARRIOR.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just live by his warrior's code - he expects others\
  \ to respect it. He looks down on cowardly tactics, refuses to dishonor a battlefield, and has no\
  \ patience for those who fight without principle. "A victory without honor isn't a victory at\
  \ all," he mutters.
DEVOUT_WARRIOR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen what war does to people - how it strips them of\
  \ identity, of morality, of who they once were. He follows a warrior's code because without it,\
  \ he's afraid of what he might become. Maybe the rules don't always make sense. But without them,\
  \ what's left of him?
DEVOUT_WARRIOR.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry approaches his work with the discipline of a warrior. He\
  \ follows personal principles, respects hierarchy and tradition, and refuses to cut corners. To\
  \ him, every role is part of the battle, and he performs his with absolute dedication.
DEVOUT_WARRIOR.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry holds himself - and others - to a standard. He believes in\
  \ honesty, integrity, and respect for the craft. Even in the most mundane work, he acts as though\
  \ he's upholding something greater than himself.
DEVOUT_WARRIOR.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen rules bend and break in the face of war. He's\
  \ watched people compromise their values to survive. He refuses. He follows a code because if he\
  \ doesn't, then nothing means anything anymore.

DUAL_WIELDING.label=Obsessed with Multitasking
DUAL_WIELDING.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in singular focus. He's coordinating\
  \ movements, rechecking systems, listening to multiple comms channels - all while actively engaging\
  \ the enemy. "You can focus on one thing at a time," he scoffs. "Or you can actually keep up."
DUAL_WIELDING.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry refuses to let his mind sit still. If he's not actively\
  \ juggling multiple tasks, he feels like he's falling behind. He strategizes, analyzes, and\
  \ fights simultaneously, sometimes to the point of overloading himself.
DUAL_WIELDING.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just multitask - he needs to. If he focuses on just\
  \ one thing, the weight of everything else creeps in. The war, the losses, the endless cycle. So\
  \ he keeps his mind running on everything at once - because stopping means thinking, and thinking\
  \ means facing reality.
DUAL_WIELDING.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry can't just do one thing. He's managing logistics while\
  \ checking reports, fixing a system while answering a question, tracking work statuses while\
  \ already planning for the next crisis. "How many tasks are you even handling right now?" someone\
  \ asks. Barry shrugs. "All of them."
DUAL_WIELDING.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry treats downtime like a failure. If he's not working on\
  \ multiple things at once, he feels unproductive. Even when others tell him to slow down, he\
  \ refuses. "If I don't do it all, who will?"
DUAL_WIELDING.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen disasters happen because someone missed a detail,\
  \ forgot a step, or didn't track everything properly. He refuses to let that happen. He tracks\
  \ everything, all the time, even if it means he's always on the edge of burnout.

EMBLEM_LOVER.label=Attached to a Personal Emblem
EMBLEM_LOVER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's personal emblem isn't just a symbol - it's who he is.\
  \ It's on his armor, his gear, everything he owns. It represents loyalty, legacy, and purpose. If\
  \ anyone disrespects it, they disrespect him. And Barry doesn't take that lightly.
EMBLEM_LOVER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry makes sure his personal emblem is visible in every\
  \ engagement. He believes in its meaning, its history, and what it stands for. "If I go down," he\
  \ mutters, adjusting it before a battle, "I go down under this symbol."
EMBLEM_LOVER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has lost people, places, and parts of himself to war, but\
  \ his personal emblem remains. It's the one thing he can still control. If that symbol is still\
  \ standing, then so is he.
EMBLEM_LOVER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry marks everything with his personal emblem - his uniform, his\
  \ tools, even his personal workspace. Whether it's nostalgia, pride, or something deeper, one\
  \ thing is clear: he won't be seen without it.
EMBLEM_LOVER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just wear his personal emblem - he preserves it. He\
  \ keeps it pristine, properly positioned, and never altered. If it's faded or damaged, he fixes\
  \ it immediately. "This isn't just decoration," he mutters. "It matters."
EMBLEM_LOVER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry keeps his personal emblem close because he needs to. It's\
  \ a reminder of who he used to be, before the war, before the losses, before everything changed.\
  \ If he ever loses it, he's afraid he might lose himself, too.

EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.label=Obsessive Debriefer
EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he analyzes. The moment a battle ends,\
  \ he's already dissecting what worked and what didn't. Positioning, timing, individual\
  \ performance - nothing escapes review. "We got through it," someone says. "Yeah," Barry mutters,\
  \ taking notes, "but how much better could it have gone?"
EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry refuses to let mistakes go unnoticed. If something went\
  \ wrong, he will find out why. He doesn't let anyone leave a mission without a full breakdown.\
  \ "This isn't criticism," he insists. "It's survival. We learn, or we don't make it next time."
EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just analyze because he wants to - he does it\
  \ because he has to. He's seen one overlooked detail turn into disaster. He reviews everything\
  \ because he knows somewhere in the data is the difference between living and dying next time.
EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry refuses to let a task go unexamined. After every\
  \ operation, he compiles full reports, goes over every detail, and demands everyone provide\
  \ feedback. "We don't just move on - we improve."
EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry won't let anything be dismissed as 'good enough'. Every\
  \ procedure, every decision, every single mistake gets analyzed in-depth. Some people find it\
  \ exhausting, but they also know that when Barry reviews something, nothing gets missed.
EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry can't stop reviewing because he's seen what happens when\
  \ people don't learn fast enough. He knows one miscalculation can doom everything. So he analyzes\
  \ relentlessly, because if something ever goes wrong again, it won't be because he didn't see it\
  \ coming.

EYE_FOR_ART.label=Appreciates Battlefield Scenery
EYE_FOR_ART.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just see battlefields as places of destruction - he\
  \ sees art in the chaos. A burning skyline, the eerie silence before an engagement, the way smoke\
  \ curls against the horizon - he notices it all. "War is ugly," he says, watching the sunrise over\
  \ wreckage, "but sometimes, it's damn beautiful too."
EYE_FOR_ART.description.1.COMBATANT=While others focus purely on tactics, Barry catches himself\
  \ staring at the way light reflects off armor, how dust settles after an explosion, how the world\
  \ keeps moving even in battle. It's not distraction - it's perspective. "You ever really look at a\
  \ battlefield?" he asks. "Not just fight in it, but see it?"
EYE_FOR_ART.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry takes in every detail, every skyline, every storm rolling\
  \ over the wasteland - not because he enjoys it, but because he knows it might be the last view he\
  \ ever has. In war, moments of beauty are fleeting, and he refuses to let them go unnoticed.
EYE_FOR_ART.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't let war completely consume his senses. Even in the\
  \ middle of crisis management, he'll stop to notice the way dust swirls in the floodlights, the\
  \ eerie beauty of a battle-scarred skyline, the quiet hum of a base before deployment.
EYE_FOR_ART.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just see battlefields as tactical locations - he\
  \ appreciates them like landscapes. The shifting sands of a desert warzone, the glowing embers of\
  \ a city fight, the way ice cracks underfoot on frozen battlefields. "Everywhere has a mood," he\
  \ mutters. "You just have to notice it."
EYE_FOR_ART.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry watches the way rain falls on ruined buildings, the way\
  \ wind howls through shattered forests, the way the sky remains untouched no matter how much\
  \ destruction unfolds beneath it. He clings to these small glimpses of beauty because if there's\
  \ still beauty, maybe there's still something worth fighting for.

FAST_TALKER.label=Talks Very Fast
FAST_TALKER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's mouth moves as fast as his mind - battle reports, status\
  \ updates, strategy shifts - all at rapid-fire speed. "Enemy left - no, two left - no, they're\
  \ repositioning - okay, we move now now now!" His squad is used to having to translate his comm\
  \ chatter into something understandable.
FAST_TALKER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry does not pause. He dumps all relevant information in one\
  \ long, breathless stream - sometimes before anyone even asks for it. "Barry, slow down." "No time\
  \ slowing wastes seconds seconds cost lives MOVE NOW."
FAST_TALKER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry keeps his words fast, his thoughts faster, because if he\
  \ slows down, the memories catch up. The losses, the failures, the ghosts of voices he'll never\
  \ hear again. So he keeps talking - because silence is worse.
FAST_TALKER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't pause - he runs through sentences like they're a\
  \ race. Reports, updates, even casual conversations come out in one long unbroken stream. "Okay\
  \ so here's the situation - supplies are low not critical but getting there plus we need to\
  \ reallocate resources or we're gonna have a big problem in maybe 36 hours max."
FAST_TALKER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry delivers every report, every status update, at maximum\
  \ speed, but somehow, he never actually misses a detail. It's like his brain moves faster than\
  \ everyone else's - or maybe he's just used to thinking three steps ahead.
FAST_TALKER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't stop moving, doesn't stop talking, because\
  \ stopping means having to think about how bad things really are. If he just keeps moving, keeps\
  \ explaining, analyzing, summarizing, maybe he won't have to acknowledge just how close\
  \ everything is to falling apart.

FINGER_GUNS.label=Uses Finger Guns
FINGER_GUNS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry can drop an enemy, turn to his buddy, and still fire off a\
  \ pair of finger guns like he's just landed a perfect shot in a bar trick. "Got 'em." His squad\
  \ can't decide if it's confidence or insanity, but it's definitely amusing.
FINGER_GUNS.description.1.COMBATANT=Mid-battle, mid-debrief, mid-anything, Barry will fire off a\
  \ quick finger gun with a cocky grin. "We got this." Somehow, it works - his squad actually feels a\
  \ little steadier. Maybe it's the certainty. Maybe it's the absurdity. Either way, it helps.
FINGER_GUNS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry cracks a finger gun after every fight, no matter how bad\
  \ it got. It's habit, a ritual, a lifeline. Because if he stops joking - if he stops acting like\
  \ any of this is normal - then he'll have to face just how much of himself this war has taken.
FINGER_GUNS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just use finger guns ironically - he fully commits\
  \ to them. Affirmation? Finger guns. Acknowledgment? Finger guns. Encouragement? Double finger\
  \ guns with a nod for extra effect.
FINGER_GUNS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has an uncanny sense for when things are getting too\
  \ tense. Right before things boil over, he fires off a well-timed finger gun and a grin just wide\
  \ enough to throw people off. It shouldn't work - but it does.
FINGER_GUNS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry throws out a pair of finger guns like it's all under\
  \ control. Like things aren't crumbling, like the latest casualty report doesn't hurt, like he's\
  \ still the guy who can crack jokes and keep going. Because if he ever stops... what then?

FLARE_DEPLOYER.label=Excessive NavPoint Use
FLARE_DEPLOYER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry drops so many NavPoints that his squad has learned to\
  \ ignore half of them. "Barry, why are there ten markers on the map?" "Different angles,\
  \ alternate routes, and in case something changes." "You marked a rock." "That's not just any\
  \ rock, that one looks like my old instructor!"
FLARE_DEPLOYER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's tactical HUD is covered in NavPoints. Enemy positions,\
  \ possible hazards, ideal cover spots, backup escape routes - it's all plotted in real time. It's\
  \ excessive. It's cluttered. But somehow, he never gets lost, and he's always in the right spot.
FLARE_DEPLOYER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's not just throwing down NavPoints for fun. He's seen\
  \ people die because they missed a critical detail. He maps everything - not because he needs to,\
  \ but because if he doesn't, he's terrified he'll miss something important. And in war, one wrong\
  \ step means someone doesn't come home.
FLARE_DEPLOYER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just provide coordinates - he floods the system with\
  \ them. "Barry, we only needed a single NavPoint." "Yeah, but I thought you'd want a secondary, a\
  \ tertiary, and a contingency in case of sudden emergencies."
FLARE_DEPLOYER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry won't trust anyone to just remember directions. If there's\
  \ a system for marking locations, he's using it to the extreme. Maps, overlays, and digital\
  \ routes all get a ridiculous amount of detail.
FLARE_DEPLOYER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry isn't marking maps out of habit - he's doing it because he's\
  \ been in situations where people got lost, where wrong turns led to death, where missing a\
  \ NavPoint meant disaster. If the map is overloaded, so be it. At least no one can say they\
  \ didn't know where to go.

FRIENDLY_INTERROGATOR.label=Likes to "Interrogate" Teammates
FRIENDLY_INTERROGATOR.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just accept things at face value - he needs\
  \ details. If a teammate makes a weird call, if someone hesitates, if a decision seems off, he's\
  \ on them immediately. "Why'd you take that route? What were you thinking? Did you see something\
  \ I didn't?"
FRIENDLY_INTERROGATOR.description.1.COMBATANT=After every battle, Barry grills his teammates like an\
  \ overzealous investigator. "What were you thinking when you did that?" "How'd that shot feel?"\
  \ "Would you do it differently next time?" It's not hostile - it's just... relentless.
FRIENDLY_INTERROGATOR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry isn't just nosy - he's paranoid. He's seen too many people\
  \ make mistakes that cost lives. If he questions everything, then maybe he'll catch something\
  \ before it gets him or someone else killed.
FRIENDLY_INTERROGATOR.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry needs to know why people do what they do. If someone takes\
  \ an unexpected approach, if a decision seems even slightly unusual, he's asking way too many\
  \ questions about it. "Oh, interesting choice - why? No, really, walk me through it."
FRIENDLY_INTERROGATOR.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't accept simple answers. "Because it works" isn't\
  \ good enough - he wants process, reasoning, philosophy. "Yeah, but why do you think that? And what\
  \ if you had to do it without that resource?" His teammates have learned to be very prepared when\
  \ talking to him.
FRIENDLY_INTERROGATOR.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry asks too many questions because he's seen what happens\
  \ when people don't talk. He's seen people sit on critical information, small hesitations that\
  \ later got people killed. So now? He asks, and he keeps asking until he's satisfied.

GUN_NUT.label=Fascinated by Ancient Firearms
GUN_NUT.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry isn't just a warrior - he's a historian of destruction.\
  \ Every time he picks up a new weapon, he's comparing it to ancient ballistic arms. "You think\
  \ this is impressive? Back in the 20th century, they were pulling off headshots with iron sights\
  \ and lead slugs."
GUN_NUT.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just admire ancient firearms - he trusts them.\
  \ "Give me a well-maintained slug thrower over some overcomplicated energy weapon any day," he\
  \ grumbles. He swears by mechanical reliability over computer-assisted targeting.
GUN_NUT.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry knows war has always been brutal, but he can't help but\
  \ feel that something was different back then. Fights were personal, weapons required\
  \ craftsmanship, and victory was skill, not just tech superiority. He wonders if warriors of the\
  \ past would laugh at how detached war has become - or pity them for how much worse it's gotten.
GUN_NUT.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just study ancient firearms - he talks about them\
  \ constantly. No matter the topic, he finds a way to bring up old-world guns. "Oh, supply\
  \ logistics? You know, back in the 21st century..."
GUN_NUT.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has way too many files, blueprints, and records of\
  \ obsolete ballistic weaponry. His personal workspace has framed diagrams of revolver mechanisms\
  \ and printed-out accounts of ancient battlefield tactics. "Barry, why do you have three separate\
  \ books on bolt-action rifles?" "Because they're beautiful."
GUN_NUT.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just admire old weapons - he sees them as a relic of\
  \ a different kind of war. Battles with clear fronts, clear enemies, clear objectives. Now? Now,\
  \ war never ends, and technology only makes it colder, more distant. Maybe, just maybe, the\
  \ warriors of old understood something they've all forgotten.

LAST_MAN_STANDING.label=Last Man Standing Mentality
LAST_MAN_STANDING.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry goes into every battle assuming he'll be the last one\
  \ left. He fights like backup isn't coming, like no one else is going to save the day. "Hope for\
  \ the best, plan for the worst," he mutters, "And the worst is usually me alone, fighting to the\
  \ end."
LAST_MAN_STANDING.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't stop. No matter how bad things get, no matter how\
  \ many people fall around him, he keeps going. "Retreat?" he scoffs. "You can retreat if you\
  \ want. I'll be here when you decide to push forward again."
LAST_MAN_STANDING.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry knows how this goes. He's watched lances get wiped out,\
  \ seen friends disappear from the comms, been the only one left in the aftermath. So he doesn't\
  \ expect anyone to have his back. He doesn't wait for reinforcements. He fights like he's already\
  \ alone.
LAST_MAN_STANDING.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't rely on others to clean up after a crisis - he\
  \ expects to be the last one handling it. "If this whole system fails, I'm the one who's going to\
  \ be picking up the pieces. So excuse me if I make damn sure it doesn't."
LAST_MAN_STANDING.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't clock out just because his shift is over - if things\
  \ are falling apart, he stays until it's handled. He's the last one in the control room, the last\
  \ one running diagnostics, the last one making sure everything is actually stable before he\
  \ leaves.
LAST_MAN_STANDING.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen too many disasters unfold because people assumed\
  \ someone else would handle it. He doesn't trust anyone to pick up the slack, doesn't believe in\
  \ someone else stepping in. If something needs to be done, he treats it like he's the last person\
  \ left to do it. Because one day, he will be.

LEGENDARY_MEK.label=Believes in the Black Marauder
LEGENDARY_MEK.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just believe in the legend of the Black\
  \ Marauder - he treats it like fact. He's heard the stories, maybe even witnessed the impossible.\
  \ "You ever see a lance go silent with no explanation? Yeah. That's it. The Black Marauder's\
  \ real - and if it comes for you, you don't see it coming."
LEGENDARY_MEK.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry notices every oddity in combat. Glitched sensors, missing\
  \ wreckage, a squad that should have made it back but didn't. "This wasn't just bad luck," he\
  \ mutters, staring at a battlefield that feels too quiet. "This was something else."
LEGENDARY_MEK.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen things that don't make sense. Forces that\
  \ shouldn't have lost, but did. Enemies that shouldn't have survived, but didn't just\
  \ survive - they vanished. He believes in the Black Marauder because he needs to. Because if it's\
  \ not real, then what the hell is happening out there?
LEGENDARY_MEK.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just believe in the Black Marauder - he documents.\
  \ If there's a story, he's heard it. If there's an anomaly in the records, he's marked it. He has\
  \ an entire hidden file of unexplained incidents. "Coincidence? You really think this many\
  \ vanishings are coincidence?"
LEGENDARY_MEK.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry finds a way to connect any strange occurrence to the Black\
  \ Marauder. Lost patrol? Possible sighting. Broken comms? Could be interference. Even mundane\
  \ issues somehow lead to, "You know, this exact same thing happened before a confirmed Black\
  \ Marauder event."
LEGENDARY_MEK.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen too much weirdness to believe in accidents. He\
  \ isn't chasing ghost stories - he's trying to understand something that shouldn't exist. Because\
  \ if the Black Marauder is real, if it's out there, then at least there's an answer. Even if it's\
  \ one no one wants to hear.

PASSIVE_LEADER.label=Leads Through Passivity
PASSIVE_LEADER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't bark commands, doesn't dictate tactics - he just\
  \ moves with purpose, and people follow. He sets an example, makes decisions without making a\
  \ show of it, and somehow, his squad ends up doing exactly what needs to be done. "I didn't tell\
  \ you what to do," he shrugs. "You just figured it out."
PASSIVE_LEADER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't force control - he lets things unfold. He waits,\
  \ watches, lets people make their own calls, and only steps in when absolutely necessary. "You\
  \ don't need me telling you what to do," he says. "You just need to know I'll step in when it\
  \ actually matters."
PASSIVE_LEADER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has watched too many commanders micromanage their teams\
  \ into disaster. He knows that forcing leadership breeds hesitation - and hesitation gets people\
  \ killed. So he doesn't push. He just moves, acts, and hopes they trust him enough to follow.
PASSIVE_LEADER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry isn't in charge - but somehow, people listen to him anyway.\
  \ He doesn't make demands, doesn't give orders - he just does things the right way, and others end\
  \ up following his lead without realizing it.
PASSIVE_LEADER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry lets people struggle a little, lets them make their own\
  \ choices, lets them think they're leading themselves. And right when they need it, he offers\
  \ just enough of a push. "You got this," he says. "But if I were you, I'd check that system\
  \ first."
PASSIVE_LEADER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry refuses to be another voice barking orders. He's seen how\
  \ people break under too much control, how they stop thinking for themselves. So he leads\
  \ quietly, indirectly - because if they believe they're choosing to follow him, they'll actually\
  \ commit to it.

REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.label=Rebellious Without Cause
REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't outright refuse orders - but he always questions\
  \ them, always challenges them, always finds a way to make it clear that he's choosing to follow,\
  \ not just obeying. "I could do it that way," he mutters. "Or I could do it my way - which, let's\
  \ be real, is probably better."
REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't follow rules because they're rules - he follows\
  \ them if they make sense to him. Chain of command? Optional. Discipline? Situational. If someone\
  \ tries to pull rank on him without proving they deserve it, he'll make their life very difficult.
REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just push back for fun - he does it because he's\
  \ seen what happens when people follow orders without question. He refuses to be another pawn,\
  \ another body thrown into the grinder. If he fights, if he follows, it's his choice - not theirs.
REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't break major rules - just enough to be a problem.\
  \ Skipping unnecessary steps, bypassing bureaucracy, tweaking procedures because they annoy him.\
  \ "Look, it still works," he says, grinning. "I just did it without all the nonsense."
REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't care if something is company policy, mission\
  \ standard, or "how things are done." If he doesn't agree with it, he's going to find a way\
  \ around it. "It's not rebellion," he argues. "It's efficiency."
REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has watched too many people get crushed by systems that\
  \ never cared about them. So he resists - not for a cause, not for justice, but because it keeps\
  \ him from becoming another cog in the machine. If he stops pushing back, he's afraid he'll lose\
  \ himself entirely.

SIMPLE_LIFE.label=Prefers Simple Solutions
SIMPLE_LIFE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't waste time with overcomplicated tactics. If the\
  \ objective is clear, so is the path to victory. "Why maneuver for fifteen minutes when we can\
  \ just hit them where it hurts?" If a problem has a straightforward answer, that's the one he's\
  \ taking.
SIMPLE_LIFE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry sees people spend too much time planning when the best\
  \ solution is just doing the obvious thing. "We could run three simulations, analyze terrain\
  \ variations, and draft contingencies... or we could just shoot the thing that's causing problems."
SIMPLE_LIFE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has watched squads waste time on complex strategies - and\
  \ seen them die before they could execute them. He keeps things simple because simple keeps\
  \ people alive. The more moving parts there are, the more ways everything can fall apart.
SIMPLE_LIFE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in unnecessary steps. If a task has five\
  \ stages, he's figuring out how to do it in two. If a system is too complicated, he's already\
  \ looking for a workaround. "Why do it this way when we could do it the easy way?"
SIMPLE_LIFE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry hates when people turn basic tasks into logistical\
  \ nightmares. If he sees someone struggling with pointless extra steps, he can't help but step\
  \ in. "Just do it like this - see? Done. No headaches. Why are we making this complicated?"
SIMPLE_LIFE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't simplify things out of laziness - he does it because\
  \ he's seen what happens when systems collapse under their own weight. The more complex something\
  \ is, the more likely it is to fail at the worst possible moment. Simple isn't just better - it's\
  \ safer.

ANTI_AUTHORITY.label=Distrusts Authority
ANTI_AUTHORITY.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't take orders at face value. If a superior gives a\
  \ command, his first instinct is to question why. "Are we sure that's not just a suicide mission\
  \ dressed up as a strategy?" He follows orders - sometimes - but only when he's convinced they\
  \ actually make sense.
ANTI_AUTHORITY.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust allied command, mission planners, or anyone\
  \ not risking their own skin. He's seen too many decisions made by people who never have to face\
  \ the consequences. "Oh, great, another 'brilliant strategy' from someone sitting in an\
  \ underground, reinforced bunker."
ANTI_AUTHORITY.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry used to trust the chain of command. But then he saw too\
  \ many bad calls, too many good people thrown away like resources. Now, he assumes any order\
  \ could be the one that gets him - or his squad - killed for someone else's ambition.
ANTI_AUTHORITY.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in transparent leadership. If someone in\
  \ charge says everything is fine, his first instinct is to check for himself. "Oh, sure, no\
  \ problems at all - except for the dozen red flags you're ignoring."
ANTI_AUTHORITY.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't blindly follow procedures, policies, or team\
  \ initiatives. If leadership wants something done, they'd better have a real justification for\
  \ it. "I'm not ignoring common sense just because someone with a title says so."
ANTI_AUTHORITY.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen leadership make the wrong call, watched the\
  \ fallout, and buried the people who paid the price. He doesn't assume those in charge are\
  \ evil - but he does assume they're too distant to care what happens to people like him.

BLOODLUST.label=Thrives in Chaos
BLOODLUST.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry isn't just comfortable in chaotic battles - he lives for\
  \ them. When formations break, when plans crumble, when everything turns into an unpredictable\
  \ mess, that's when he's at his best. "You're panicking? Relax. This is when things get fun."
BLOODLUST.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't freeze when things go sideways - he accelerates.\
  \ No hesitation, no second-guessing, just instinct and action. His squad watches him make\
  \ reckless choices that somehow always pay off. "Stop overthinking. Just move."
BLOODLUST.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just accept chaos - he expects it. He's seen too\
  \ many battles fall apart, too many plans shatter on contact with reality. The ones who survive?\
  \ They're the ones who stop trying to force order onto war and start embracing the madness.
BLOODLUST.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry is at his absolute best when things are at their worst.\
  \ When deadlines stack up, when systems crash, when everyone else is panicking, he's calmly\
  \ fixing six things at once. "Crisis? Nah, this is when I get stuff done."
BLOODLUST.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry struggles with routine but flourishes under pressure. If\
  \ everything is calm and stable, he gets bored. But the moment things start falling apart, he\
  \ snaps into focus. "I swear, you only work properly when the whole system is burning down."\
  \ Barry grins. "Well, yeah."
BLOODLUST.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has watched too many people break when their perfect plans\
  \ collapsed. He doesn't believe in stability - he believes in adapting to the inevitable disaster.\
  \ He thrives in chaos because, to him, chaos is the only thing that's ever truly reliable.

BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.label=Acts Bravely When Doubted
BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't take doubt as criticism - he takes it as a\
  \ challenge. The second someone questions if he can handle a fight, he throws himself into it\
  \ headfirst. "Oh, you don't think I can do it? Watch me."
BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.description.1.COMBATANT=People assume Barry's too brash, too impulsive - but every time\
  \ someone underestimates him, he rises to the occasion. He doesn't just survive impossible\
  \ situations - he thrives in them. "I don't need you to believe in me. I just need you to stay out\
  \ of my way."
BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry isn't fearless - he's terrified of being just another\
  \ warrior lost to history. He fights like he has something to prove, because if he doesn't, then\
  \ what was the point? When someone doubts him, he takes it personally. "You think I won't make\
  \ it? That's fine. I'll prove you wrong - or die trying."
BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't seek the spotlight, doesn't need to prove\
  \ himself - until someone implies he's not up to the task. The moment someone says, "I don't think\
  \ you can pull this off," Barry immediately sets out to do exactly that.
BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry isn't the loudest person in the room, but if someone\
  \ questions his competence, he won't rest until he proves them wrong. "You said I couldn't fix\
  \ this in time? Well, I just did. So what now?"
BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just fight for respect - he fights for recognition.\
  \ He's seen what happens to the ones who blend into the background, the ones no one remembers\
  \ when the dust settles. If being doubted means pushing himself harder, then so be it. "You think\
  \ I can't do it? Then I have to. Because otherwise, I'm nothing."

CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.label=Obsesses over Duels
CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry can't go five minutes without bringing up legendary\
  \ duels. "Yeah, yeah, battlefield tactics are fine, but have you see Molotov vs. Indigo? That was\
  \ real combat." He knows every famous match, every underdog story, every historic upset.
CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just watch duels - he models his entire combat\
  \ style after them. Flashy maneuvers, high-risk plays, individualist mentality - he fights like\
  \ he's putting on a show, even in real warzones. "I don't just want to win - I want them to\
  \ remember me."
CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry knows real war is brutal, messy, and unfair. Arena \
  fights? They have rules, honor, a winner and a loser. He clings to the idea that somewhere,\
  \ there's a version of combat where skill alone decides the outcome. Because if that's not true,\
  \ then what's the point of all of it?
CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't talk about politics, history, or strategy - he talks\
  \ about the greatest arena fights of all time. He remembers them move for move, can analyze every\
  \ mistake, and treats duelist legends like war heroes.
CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.description.1.SUPPORT=No matter what's happening, Barry finds a way to bring up arena\
  \ fights. "Oh, you think that's impressive? You should've seen the time War Dog ran a one-legged\
  \ Thunderbolt to victory against Black Mamba" He's that guy.
CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry knows war is nothing like the arenas, but he wishes it\
  \ was. At least in the arenas, there's a purpose, an end to the fight that isn't just more\
  \ suffering. If he can't fight in the arenas, at least he can dream about a world where war is\
  \ just entertainment instead of reality.

COOL_UNDER_FIRE.label=Remains Calm Under Fire
COOL_UNDER_FIRE.description.0.COMBATANT=Explosions, alarms, everything falling apart - Barry doesn't even\
  \ flinch. While others are shouting, scrambling for cover, panicking, he's coolly assessing the\
  \ situation. "Relax," he says, reloading like it's just another drill. "If they were gonna kill\
  \ us, they'd have done it already."
COOL_UNDER_FIRE.description.1.COMBATANT=When chaos erupts, Barry doesn't freeze - he slows down. He reads\
  \ the battlefield, calculates options, and makes the right move without hesitation. Others act on\
  \ fear - he acts on certainty. "Breathe. Think. Then shoot."
COOL_UNDER_FIRE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't panic because he knows what real fear looks like.\
  \ He's been through worse, lost too much, seen things he won't talk about. Compared to that?\
  \ Incoming fire is just background noise.
COOL_UNDER_FIRE.description.0.SUPPORT=Systems crashing, power failures, emergency klaxons - Barry\
  \ doesn't rush, doesn't freak out. He keeps working, methodically solving the problem, while\
  \ others are losing their minds. "Panicking doesn't fix anything," he mutters. "Let's focus on\
  \ what will."
COOL_UNDER_FIRE.description.1.SUPPORT=When the situation spirals out of control, Barry doesn't add to\
  \ the noise - he cuts through it. His voice is steady, his hands don't shake, and somehow, his calm\
  \ forces everyone else to settle down too. "One thing at a time," he says. "We get through this\
  \ like we always do."
COOL_UNDER_FIRE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen too many situations turn disastrous because\
  \ everyone panicked at the wrong moment. He refuses to be that guy. If no one else can keep their\
  \ head, he will. Because if someone doesn't stay calm, then no one makes it out.

CRASH_TEST.label=Purposely Tests Equipment Durability
CRASH_TEST.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just use his equipment - he abuses it. He pushes\
  \ everything past its rated limits, just to find out where they break. "If it fails now, that\
  \ means it would've failed in combat."
CRASH_TEST.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in manufacturer guarantees. He doesn't\
  \ care what the specs say - he needs proof. So he pushes every piece of equipment past its redline,\
  \ just to make sure it holds up when it really matters. "If it survives me, it'll survive a\
  \ battlefield."
CRASH_TEST.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen the consequences of untested equipment failing\
  \ at the worst possible moment. A heat sink that should have handled the load, a weapon that\
  \ jammed when it mattered most. Now, he breaks things before battle - because if they fail in\
  \ testing, they won't fail when lives are on the line.
CRASH_TEST.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just check if something works - he checks if it can\
  \ survive abuse. He runs systems hotter, pushes components harder, and doesn't stop until\
  \ something fails spectacularly. "Oh, come on, it says it can handle this - so let's find out."
CRASH_TEST.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry refuses to sign off on anything until he's personally\
  \ stress-tested it beyond reasonable limits. If a component is rated for ten tons of pressure,\
  \ he's testing it at fifteen. If a system shouldn't overheat, he's finding out what temperature\
  \ actually kills it. "Better here than in the field."
CRASH_TEST.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen people die because a system failed under real\
  \ conditions. He doesn't trust any spec sheet - he only trusts what he's tested himself. If that\
  \ means he destroys some gear in the process, so be it. It's better than losing people because\
  \ someone trusted an untested number on a screen.

DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.label=Uses Deadpan Humor
DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry has a knack for perfectly-timed, emotionless one-liners.\
  \ Explosions in the distance? "Well, that sounds promising." Half his squad wiped out? "Guess\
  \ it's my turn, then." It's never clear if he's joking, but it definitely helps break the tension.
DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't panic - he makes a dry remark and keeps moving.\
  \ "We're outnumbered ten to one." Barry nods. "Oh good, that's an even fight." His squad isn't\
  \ sure if he's fearless or just too dead inside to care anymore.
DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry cracks emotionless jokes because if he stopped to process\
  \ everything, it might actually get to him. It's easier to act like it's all just a mildly\
  \ inconvenient joke than admit just how close they all are to dying at any given moment.
DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's reports always start with something grim. "Well,\
  \ everything's broken, we're running on fumes, and I assume command has already planned our\
  \ funerals." Pause. "Anyway, I patched the issue. It should be fine."
DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.description.1.SUPPORT=Emergency meeting? Barry's there with a straight face. "Oh,\
  \ don't worry. We're only mildly doomed." No one's sure if he's joking. He never clarifies.
DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't laugh because nothing is actually funny anymore.\
  \ But if he doesn't make some kind of joke, then all that's left is the weight of everything\
  \ falling apart around him. So instead, he keeps his voice flat, his delivery emotionless, and\
  \ his humor just dark enough to keep everyone uneasy.

DRILLS.label=Obsessed with Drills and Simulations
DRILLS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry treats every drill like it's life or death - because one\
  \ day, it will be. He runs combat sims until his squad hates him for it. "You think this is\
  \ excessive?" he asks, dead serious. "Tell me that after we survive the real thing."
DRILLS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry lives for simulations. He has counter-strategies for\
  \ everything, from basic ambushes to hypothetical enemy maneuvers no one else has ever\
  \ considered. "It's not paranoia," he says. "It's being ready."
DRILLS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has watched warriors die because they froze up, made a\
  \ bad call, or simply weren't prepared. Now, he drills relentlessly - because if he can burn\
  \ survival into muscle memory, maybe he can save at least a few of them next time.
DRILLS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry runs drills for everything - from emergency evacuations to\
  \ what to do if a DropShip crash-lands on HQ. His colleagues groan, but he doesn't care. "When it\
  \ actually happens, you'll thank me."
DRILLS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't trust any system, plan, or procedure unless it's\
  \ been tested to the breaking point. "If we haven't drilled it under pressure, then we don't know\
  \ if it actually works." And if that means running another sim? Then they're running another sim.
DRILLS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen people die because they hesitated. Because they\
  \ didn't know what to do fast enough. He drills everything because in the moment, there's no time\
  \ to think - there's just reacting right, or dying fast.

ENEMY_RESPECT.label=Respects Worthy Enemies
ENEMY_RESPECT.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't hate his enemies - he studies them. If someone\
  \ fights well, if they make the right calls, if they push him to his limits, he remembers them.\
  \ "That guy? They're good. Next time, I'll have to be better."
ENEMY_RESPECT.description.1.COMBATANT=When Barry faces an enemy that truly challenges him, he\
  \ thrives. He doesn't just fight to win - he fights to prove himself. "No tricks, no gimmicks - just\
  \ skill. Let's see who walks away."
ENEMY_RESPECT.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry knows war is ugly, merciless, brutal. But when he finds\
  \ an enemy who fights with skill, honor, and intelligence, he acknowledges them. Because if\
  \ there's nothing but slaughter and chaos, then what's the point of fighting at all?
ENEMY_RESPECT.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just track enemy movements - he analyzes them like\
  \ an art form. If an opposing force executes a brilliant maneuver, he's the first to point it\
  \ out. "That was genius. Annoying, but genius."
ENEMY_RESPECT.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't dismiss enemy forces as just another threat. If\
  \ they're skilled, if they earn his respect, he talks about them like they're part of the game.\
  \ "That commander? If they were on our side, we'd never lose."
ENEMY_RESPECT.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't respect every enemy - just the ones who fight with\
  \ honor. Because he's seen the other kind - the ones who kill without reason, without restraint.\
  \ Against them? There's no respect. Only destruction.

EXTREME_MORNING_PERSON.label=Extremely Morning-Oriented
EXTREME_MORNING_PERSON.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry is up before dawn, already running drills while the rest\
  \ of the squad is barely conscious. "Morning is when the real soldiers prepare," he says, sipping\
  \ a steaming-hot cup of coffee while everyone else groans.
EXTREME_MORNING_PERSON.description.1.COMBATANT=By the time others are starting their first briefing, Barry has\
  \ already run a full systems check, a workout, and possibly a simulated battle. "I've been\
  \ productive for hours," he grins, as someone else mumbles, "It's literally 0500."
EXTREME_MORNING_PERSON.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just wake up early - he needs to. He's seen too\
  \ many people go to sleep and never wake up again. He refuses to waste a single morning, because\
  \ every sunrise might be the last one he sees.
EXTREME_MORNING_PERSON.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry is already deep into work before anyone else even stumbles\
  \ in. He's organized files, triple-checked systems, and probably had two cups of coffee before\
  \ people even start showing up. "Good morning! Oh, right. You're still half-asleep."
EXTREME_MORNING_PERSON.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry does not tolerate sluggish morning energy. If someone's\
  \ not awake enough to function, he calls them out on it. "Maybe if you woke up on time, you\
  \ wouldn't be struggling with this." He says this while effortlessly handling three tasks at once.
EXTREME_MORNING_PERSON.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's body refuses to let him sleep past dawn. Years of\
  \ training, of near-death moments in the dark, of knowing that the ones who hesitate die first,\
  \ have burned it into him. He wakes up before the danger does, because that's what's kept him\
  \ alive so far.

GALLANT.label=Gallant in Battle
GALLANT.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he fights with style. Whether it's a\
  \ dramatic duel, a well-timed flourish, or a perfectly executed maneuver, he makes battle look\
  \ good. "If you're going to fight," he grins, dodging incoming fire, "you might as well make it\
  \ memorable."
GALLANT.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry refuses to abandon his squad, even when it means putting\
  \ himself in danger. He's the one diving into enemy fire to pull a comrade out, the one holding\
  \ the line so others can escape. "You go," he says, standing firm. "I'll make sure they don't\
  \ follow you."
GALLANT.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry fights with honor because he refuses to become just\
  \ another killer. He's seen what war does to people - how it turns them into cold, brutal\
  \ survivors. If he's going to fight, he'll do it his way - with courage, with dignity, and with the\
  \ hope that it still matters.
GALLANT.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry approaches every task like he's leading a charge. Whether\
  \ he's repairing a system or handling logistics, he does it with the same pride and confidence as\
  \ if he were on the front lines. "Not all heroes wear coolant vests," he smirks, adjusting his\
  \ gloves.
GALLANT.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry never hesitates to step up when someone needs help. If\
  \ there's a problem, he's handling it, if someone's struggling, he's lifting them up. He makes\
  \ sure everyone succeeds - not just himself. "You don't leave your people behind," he says simply.
GALLANT.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has watched too many people lose themselves to war. He\
  \ refuses to let that happen to him. No matter how bad things get, no matter how much he's lost,\
  \ he still stands tall, unshaken, and unbroken. If he has to fight, he'll do it with dignity.

IRON_STOMACH.label=Can Eat Anything
IRON_STOMACH.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry has zero food standards. Expired rations? Still good.\
  \ Field scavenged supplies? Edible. Some questionable protein paste found in a destroyed base?\
  \ "If it doesn't kill me, it's food." His squad is horrified - he doesn't even hesitate before\
  \ taking a bite.
IRON_STOMACH.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry eats for survival, not pleasure. He'll consume anything\
  \ that keeps him moving, from high-energy nutrient bricks to mysterious battlefield leftovers.\
  \ "Food is fuel," he shrugs, gnawing on something vaguely resembling jerky. "Doesn't matter what\
  \ it is as long as it works."
IRON_STOMACH.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't complain about food because he's been through\
  \ worse. He's starved before. He's had weeks where meals weren't an option. So if it's even\
  \ remotely edible, he eats it - because he knows what it's like when there's nothing left to eat at\
  \ all.
IRON_STOMACH.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't care if the meal is burned, over-processed, or\
  \ unidentifiable. If it's served, he's eating it. "Oh, that's the bad batch?" he asks, taking a\
  \ bite anyway. "Tastes fine to me."
IRON_STOMACH.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry eats whatever is fastest, cheapest, or most available.\
  \ Nutrient paste, expired protein bars, mystery leftovers from two days ago - he's completely\
  \ unbothered. "You're picky about food? Must be nice."
IRON_STOMACH.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't waste time worrying about taste because he's seen\
  \ people die on an empty stomach. He eats whatever's there because, in war, food is just another\
  \ resource - and running out of it can mean the difference between life and death.

MISSION_CRITIC.label=Hyper-Critical of Mission Plans
MISSION_CRITIC.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just hear a mission briefing - he dissects it.\
  \ Before command even finishes talking, he's already identified every weak point, every flaw, and\
  \ every way it could get people killed. "Yeah, okay, but what happens when this part fails?\
  \ Because it will fail."
MISSION_CRITIC.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just trust a plan because it came from higher up\
  \ the chain. He needs to see it work. If he's not convinced, he'll grill leadership until they\
  \ either justify it or fix it. "I'm not running a mission just because someone in a suit thinks\
  \ it should work."
MISSION_CRITIC.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry used to trust mission briefings - until he saw too many bad\
  \ calls end in disaster. Now, he refuses to blindly follow anything. If a plan isn't bulletproof,\
  \ he's going to tear it apart - because in war, the ones who don't question bad plans end up dead.
MISSION_CRITIC.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry isn't trying to be difficult - he just refuses to accept\
  \ half-baked plans. If there's a flaw, he will find it, and he will point it out. "Oh, so we're\
  \ just assuming supply lines hold? Yeah, that's gonna go great."
MISSION_CRITIC.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry believes every strategy should be tested, retested, and\
  \ stress-tested again. If something isn't solid, he's stopping everything until it is. "Look, you\
  \ can go with this version, or you can go with the one that actually works."
MISSION_CRITIC.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen too many missions fail because someone didn't ask\
  \ enough questions. He doesn't criticize plans for fun - he does it because he knows that bad\
  \ planning kills just as effectively as enemy fire. And he refuses to be part of another botched\
  \ operation that leaves people dead for no reason.

NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.label=Believes in "No Pain, No Gain"
NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in taking it easy. Every drill, every\
  \ mission, every battle - he pushes himself past the limit, convinced that if it doesn't hurt, it\
  \ doesn't count. "You're sore? Good. That means you're improving."
NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.description.1.COMBATANT=To Barry, pain isn't a problem - it's proof he's still alive. He\
  \ doesn't back down from grueling conditions, punishing training, or even injuries. "Hurts? Yeah,\
  \ it's supposed to. If you want to be better, you learn to live with it."
NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen what happens to soldiers who hesitate when\
  \ things get rough. He doesn't believe in comfort, in taking it slow, in waiting until conditions\
  \ are right. War doesn't care if you're hurting. Either you push through it, or you die.
NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't trust easy solutions. If something isn't a\
  \ challenge, he assumes it's not actually helping him improve. "If it doesn't make you sweat,\
  \ it's not worth doing."
NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in shortcuts, doesn't sympathize with\
  \ complaints, and thinks everyone should be pushing themselves harder. If someone grumbles about\
  \ a tough job, he just smirks. "You want an easy life? You picked the wrong line of work."
NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has watched people break because they weren't ready to\
  \ endure real hardship. He's seen them fail when things got too rough, collapse when the pressure\
  \ hit. He refuses to be one of them. Pain isn't just necessary - it's the price of survival.

PERSONAL_ARMORY.label=Keeps a Personal Armory
PERSONAL_ARMORY.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just have weapons - he collects them. Laser\
  \ rifles, old ballistics, experimental prototypes - his quarters look like a personal weapons\
  \ depot. "You say 'overkill,' I say 'being prepared for any situation.'"
PERSONAL_ARMORY.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust standard-issue gear - he prefers his own\
  \ meticulously maintained, custom-modified weapons. Each one has a purpose, a history, and a\
  \ reason for being in his collection. "Command says 'stick to regs.' Command can borrow my\
  \ backups when theirs fail."
PERSONAL_ARMORY.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't hoard weapons for fun - he does it because he's\
  \ seen what happens when people are caught unprepared. He's not going to be the one scrambling\
  \ for a weapon when everything falls apart. If the war comes to him, he's ready for it.
PERSONAL_ARMORY.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry may not be frontline, but he sure acts like it. He keeps\
  \ an entire stockpile of sidearms, knives, and probably some heavy weapons in places they\
  \ absolutely shouldn't be. "What? You don't have a contingency stash?"
PERSONAL_ARMORY.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't think being support staff means being unarmed.\
  \ He's got sidearms stashed in toolkits, a shotgun behind a supply crate, and at least one\
  \ knife strapped somewhere no one expects. "Look, I don't plan for things to go south - I just make\
  \ sure when they do, I'm still standing."
PERSONAL_ARMORY.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in the idea of 'safe zones.' He's seen\
  \ support staff get wiped out, seen people die reaching for weapons they didn't have. He refuses\
  \ to be helpless when the fighting reaches him. If war comes, he's bringing his own guns to the fight.

QUICK_ADAPTER.label=Adapts Quickly to New Situations
QUICK_ADAPTER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't freeze when things go sideways - he adjusts\
  \ instantly. Enemy reinforcements? He's already repositioning. Equipment failure? He's switching\
  \ tactics mid-fight. "You think sticking to the plan is smart? Plans get you killed. Adapting\
  \ keeps you alive."
QUICK_ADAPTER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't panic when things don't go according to mission\
  \ briefings. He expects things to shift, anticipates sudden changes, and adjusts faster than the\
  \ enemy does. "They changed their tactics? Good. That means I get to change mine too."
QUICK_ADAPTER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't have the luxury of overthinking. He's watched\
  \ soldiers die because they froze for just a second too long. If a situation shifts, he moves\
  \ first, thinks second. Because the ones who wait? They don't make it.
QUICK_ADAPTER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't panic when systems fail, supplies run out, or\
  \ schedules fall apart. He immediately finds a workaround, fixes the problem, and moves on like\
  \ it was never an issue. "Oh, the entire system crashed? Give me five minutes."
QUICK_ADAPTER.description.1.SUPPORT=New tech, new protocols, new disasters - Barry absorbs them all\
  \ instantly. He doesn't dwell on how things were done before - he just adapts. "The system changed\
  \ again? Cool. I already figured it out."
QUICK_ADAPTER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't trust stability. He's seen entire operations fall\
  \ apart in seconds. He knows the ones who survive aren't the strongest or the smartest - they're\
  \ the ones who change first. Because if you can't keep up, you're already falling behind.

RETALIATOR.label=Seeks Revenge for Any Slight
RETALIATOR.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just let things go. If an enemy targets him,\
  \ shoots in his direction, or even looks at him the wrong way, he's making damn sure they regret\
  \ it. "You scratched my armor? Bad move. Now you're my problem."
RETALIATOR.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry remembers every slight - every ambush, every dirty trick,\
  \ every insult over open comms. And he doesn't just get even - he makes sure whoever wronged him\
  \ never forgets it. "You thought I'd forget what you did? That's adorable."
RETALIATOR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in forgiveness in war. If someone gets\
  \ away with hurting him or his squad, it means they think they can do it again. He will track\
  \ them down. He will make it right. Because if he doesn't? Then what's the point of fighting at\
  \ all?
RETALIATOR.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry may not start conflicts, but he never lets them go. If\
  \ someone questions his work, mocks his methods, or even slightly disrespects him, he's keeping a\
  \ mental file on them forever. "Oh, you thought that snide comment wasn't going to have\
  \ consequences? Cute."
RETALIATOR.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's revenge isn't loud - it's calculated. Delayed requisition\
  \ forms, conveniently missing supplies, small but infuriating inconveniences. He doesn't lash\
  \ out - he waits, plans, and strikes when it's most effective.
RETALIATOR.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry can't let slights go, because he knows that if he does, it\
  \ sets a precedent. If people think they can walk over him, they will. So he makes sure every\
  \ slight is paid back - because in this world, respect is only given to those who take it by force.

RUSH_HOUR.label=Enjoys the Rush of a Crisis
RUSH_HOUR.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just handle chaotic situations - he thrives in\
  \ them. When the battle turns into a full-blown disaster, he's grinning, moving faster, thinking\
  \ sharper. "Oh, now we're really playing," he says, dodging incoming fire like it's just another\
  \ drill.
RUSH_HOUR.description.1.COMBATANT=The more desperate the fight, the more focused Barry becomes.\
  \ He doesn't care about calm, controlled engagements - he wants last stands, desperate charges,\
  \ impossible odds. "You call this a crisis? I call it a challenge."
RUSH_HOUR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just enjoy the rush - he needs it. In the quiet\
  \ moments, his hands shake, his mind won't stop racing. But when the crisis hits? He's steady,\
  \ clear, unbreakable. Because if he's not in danger, he's not sure who he even is anymore.
RUSH_HOUR.description.0.SUPPORT=When everything is falling apart, Barry isn't panicking - he's\
  \ energized. He's fixing systems, rerouting power, barking orders like he's been waiting for\
  \ this. "Oh no, a total systems meltdown? Finally, something interesting."
RUSH_HOUR.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't cause problems, but when things are too quiet, he\
  \ gets restless. When a crisis does hit, he jumps in with way too much enthusiasm. "Catastrophic\
  \ failure? Yeah, okay, let's go!"
RUSH_HOUR.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't enjoy disaster, but it's the only time people need\
  \ him, listen to him, rely on him. When things are calm, he feels irrelevant. But in a crisis?\
  \ That's when he's truly alive.

SILENT_PROTECTOR.label=Protects Allies Silently
SILENT_PROTECTOR.description.0.COMBATANT=Without Ever Saying It Out Loud) - Barry doesn't make a big\
  \ deal about watching over his team - he just does it. Covering flanks, blocking shots, dragging a\
  \ wounded ally to safety - he never talks about it. "Just keep moving," he mutters, holding the\
  \ line without expecting thanks.
SILENT_PROTECTOR.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry won't give speeches about teamwork, loyalty, or honor.\
  \ But when things go bad, he's the one putting himself between the danger and his friends. He'll\
  \ take hits, hold positions, and sacrifice his advantage just to keep others alive. "Don't worry\
  \ about me. Just finish the job."
SILENT_PROTECTOR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen too many people get left behind. He won't let it\
  \ happen again. If his squad is in trouble, he's already moving to cover them. Because if someone\
  \ has to take the risk, it'll be him - every time.
SILENT_PROTECTOR.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't announce what he's doing - he just quietly makes\
  \ sure things go right. If a system is failing, if supplies are running low, if someone needs\
  \ help, he's already handling it before they know to ask.
SILENT_PROTECTOR.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't expect thanks, doesn't make a scene, doesn't draw\
  \ attention. If someone's struggling, he quietly covers for them. If a mistake needs fixing, he\
  \ corrects it before anyone notices. "No need to mention it. Just... try not to screw up next time."
SILENT_PROTECTOR.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't everyone else first for praise - he does it because\
  \ he knows how easy it is for people to fall through the cracks. If someone has to keep things\
  \ from spiraling out of control, it might as well be him.

ALWAYS_TACTICAL.label=Always Thinking Tactically
ALWAYS_TACTICAL.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just react - he anticipates. He's analyzing enemy\
  \ movements, tracking supply positions, and adjusting for terrain advantages before his squad\
  \ even realizes the fight has shifted. "They're moving left. Cut them off at that ridge in three\
  \ seconds."
ALWAYS_TACTICAL.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry fights efficiently, wasting zero movements, always\
  \ predicting the next step. If something looks like luck, it's actually precision. "You think\
  \ that was instinct? No. That was reading the field before it happened."
ALWAYS_TACTICAL.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't get lost in the fight - he controls it. He's seen\
  \ how quickly things spiral when people stop thinking and start reacting blindly. War isn't just\
  \ brutality - it's a series of calculations with life-or-death stakes.
ALWAYS_TACTICAL.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry sees everything as a tactical problem to be solved. Supply\
  \ chains? Personnel assignments? Resource management? "You don't win wars with guns alone. You\
  \ win them by out-thinking the enemy before the first shot is fired."
ALWAYS_TACTICAL.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just solve current problems - he's already planning\
  \ for what comes next. If someone suggests a course of action, he's already identified the\
  \ weaknesses and alternatives. "Good plan. Now tell me what happens when it goes wrong."
ALWAYS_TACTICAL.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in luck or optimism. He's seen too many\
  \ brilliant strategies collapse because no one thought about contingencies. He strategizes\
  \ relentlessly, because in war, the best plans are the ones that don't get you killed when they\
  \ fail.

BATTLE_SCREAM.label=Uses a Battle Scream
BATTLE_SCREAM.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't fight in silence - he fights with pure, raw energy.\
  \ Whether it's charging headfirst into combat or firing a devastating salvo, he lets out a\
  \ gut-wrenching, primal scream. "If you're not shouting, you're not really in the fight!"
BATTLE_SCREAM.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's battle scream isn't just noise - it's a weapon. It\
  \ rattles the enemy, it fires up his squad, and it drowns out everything else. Pain, fear,\
  \ exhaustion? Gone. "When you hear me scream, you follow me in, or you get out of my damn way!"
BATTLE_SCREAM.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't roar in battle for show - he roars because it's\
  \ the only way to drown out the horror of war. The burning wrecks, the dying voices, the sheer\
  \ chaos - it all disappears under his own voice. Because if he stops screaming, he might actually\
  \ hear what's happening around him.
BATTLE_SCREAM.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just work - he fights against every stubborn system,\
  \ every failing mechanism. When something won't budge, when a panel won't come loose, when a\
  \ machine resists? Cue the war cry. "YOU. WILL. WORK." Metal groans. Problem solved.
BATTLE_SCREAM.description.1.SUPPORT=If things get tense, Barry doesn't calmly handle it - he lets out\
  \ a full battle scream before diving in. Emergency alarms blaring? Scream. Major system failure?\
  \ Scream. Even a minor inconvenience? Possibly still a scream. "It's fine! Just psyching myself\
  \ up!"
BATTLE_SCREAM.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't talk about stress. He doesn't vent. He bottles it\
  \ all up - until it comes out as a piercing, primal battle scream when things reach a breaking\
  \ point. He laughs it off after. "All good now." But is it? Is it really?

BRIEF_AND_TO_THE_POINT.label=Brief and To the Point
BRIEF_AND_TO_THE_POINT.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't waste breath in combat. Orders, reports,\
  \ warnings - they're all short, direct, and immediate. "Move left." "Enemy incoming." "Cover me."\
  \ No extra words. No wasted time.
BRIEF_AND_TO_THE_POINT.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't explain things - he just does them. If someone asks\
  \ for a plan, he gives a three-word response. "We win. Let's go." Anything beyond that?\
  \ Unnecessary.
BRIEF_AND_TO_THE_POINT.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in long-winded speeches. War doesn't care\
  \ about words. If he speaks, it's because something needs to be said. And if it doesn't? He stays\
  \ silent and keeps moving.
BRIEF_AND_TO_THE_POINT.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't explain things when people should already know\
  \ them. Reports? Minimalist. Memos? One sentence. If someone asks a long-winded question, they\
  \ get a one-word answer.
BRIEF_AND_TO_THE_POINT.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry believes meetings should last five minutes, not an hour.\
  \ If there's a problem, he gives the shortest possible fix and moves on. "Problem?" Fixes it.\
  \ "Next?"
BRIEF_AND_TO_THE_POINT.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has watched people die because someone took too long\
  \ explaining something. He's learned that fewer words, faster action means better odds of\
  \ survival. If he doesn't need to say it, he doesn't.

CALLSIGN_COLLECTOR.label=Collects Callsigns
CALLSIGN_COLLECTOR.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just hear callsigns - he remembers them. Every\
  \ hero, every ace, every fallen comrade - he keeps a mental log. "Stormbringer? Yeah, I fought\
  \ against them once. Tough bastard. Still out there?"
CALLSIGN_COLLECTOR.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry insists on giving people callsigns, even if they don't\
  \ want one. If you fight with him, you earn a name, and he'll make sure it sticks. "Nah, you\
  \ don't get to be 'just Jones.' You're 'Trouser Snake' now."
CALLSIGN_COLLECTOR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't keep a list for fun - he keeps it because so many\
  \ are gone now. Callsigns are all that's left of them, and if he doesn't remember them, who will?\
  \ "Lancer. Coldsteel. Widowmaker. They fought. They mattered. I won't forget."
CALLSIGN_COLLECTOR.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just handle logistics - he documents every pilot,\
  \ every unit, every alias. If you have a callsign, he knows it, remembers it, and probably has\
  \ notes on it. "Oh yeah, you fought with Iron Fang last year, right? Heard good things."
CALLSIGN_COLLECTOR.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry rarely remembers real names, but if you give him a\
  \ callsign? He'll never forget it. "Who's 'Captain Reynolds'? No clue. Who's 'Gravedigger'? Yeah,\
  \ I know exactly who that is."
CALLSIGN_COLLECTOR.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry writes down every name, every alias, every legend. He\
  \ knows too many people disappear in this war - vanish from the records, lost to time. He refuses\
  \ to let that happen. If he has to be the last one who remembers, so be it.

CHATTERBOX.label=Constant Chatterbox
CHATTERBOX.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry is constantly narrating, cracking jokes, and running\
  \ commentary, even when dodging enemy fire. "Oh great, another missile lock - real original, guys!"\
  \ His squad has learned to tune him out or roll with it.
CHATTERBOX.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry never shuts up. He's talking tactics, reliving old\
  \ fights, or just going on about something unrelated mid-firefight. "You ever wonder if our\
  \ DropShips are just really expensive coffins? No? Just me? Cool."
CHATTERBOX.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry fills the silence because silence means thinking. And\
  \ thinking means remembering. And remembering means realizing how bad things really are. So\
  \ instead, he just keeps talking. About anything. Because if he stops, what's left?
CHATTERBOX.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just work - he talks through the process. "Okay, so\
  \ now we recalibrate the system - oh wow, this is a mess, who even installed this? - anyway, now we\
  \ just... and boom, fixed it."
CHATTERBOX.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't need an audience to talk - he's perfectly fine\
  \ talking to himself. But if someone is nearby? Even better. "Did you know that if this system\
  \ fails, we all die horribly? Just saying. Anyway, how's your day?"
CHATTERBOX.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry knows what it means when people stop talking. It means\
  \ they're tired, broken, or already lost. He refuses to let that happen to himself - or anyone\
  \ else. If he has to be the one keeping things loud and alive, then that's exactly what he'll do.

COMBAT_ARTIST.label=Combat as Art Form
COMBAT_ARTIST.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he creates. Every shot, every\
  \ maneuver, every strike is deliberate, practiced, and flawless. "Anyone can pull a trigger. A\
  \ real warrior makes it look good."
COMBAT_ARTIST.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just survive battles - he flows through them,\
  \ treating combat like a perfectly choreographed dance. Every step, every feint, every\
  \ counterattack is fluid, seamless, and effortless. "War isn't just about winning - it's about how\
  \ you win."
COMBAT_ARTIST.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't fight like a brute, because he refuses to believe\
  \ war is just violence for violence's sake. If he doesn't turn it into something greater, into\
  \ art, then what is it? Just murder. And he can't let himself believe that's all there is.
COMBAT_ARTIST.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just see war as strategy - he sees it as expression.\
  \ He studies legendary duels, dissects perfect maneuvers, and talks about battles like they\
  \ belong in a museum. "That last engagement? Pure artistry. You don't just see skill like that\
  \ every day."
COMBAT_ARTIST.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry applies his artistic philosophy to everything. If\
  \ something isn't precise, efficient, and elegant, he disapproves.
COMBAT_ARTIST.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry romanticizes war because he has to. If he lets himself see\
  \ it as just blood, destruction, and suffering, he might not be able to justify his role in it\
  \ anymore. So instead, he sees it as a craft, an art, something worth perfecting. Because if war\
  \ isn't beautiful, then it's just horror.

DARING_ESCAPE.label=Specializes in Daring Escapes
DARING_ESCAPE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just retreat - he orchestrates an escape with\
  \ flair. Smoke, misdirection, last-second maneuvers - he turns what should be a desperate flight\
  \ into something that looks almost effortless. "You call it running. I call it leaving\
  \ dramatically."
DARING_ESCAPE.description.1.COMBATANT=When things go south, Barry's already two steps ahead. He's the\
  \ one who finds the overlooked exit, or improvises a crazy plan that somehow works. "There's\
  \ always a way out. You just have to be willing to take it."
DARING_ESCAPE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't escape because he's afraid - he does it because\
  \ he's seen what happens when people refuse to retreat. He's learned that sometimes, the\
  \ difference between living and dying is knowing when to run. And he never hesitates when that\
  \ time comes.
DARING_ESCAPE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't trust any situation to stay safe for long. He's\
  \ got emergency exit routes mapped, contingency plans in place, and a go-bag ready at all times.\
  \ "You laugh now, but when everything goes to hell, I'll be the one getting out alive."
DARING_ESCAPE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has an uncanny ability to disappear from dangerous,\
  \ awkward, or annoying situations. He's the first one to duck out of a failing meeting, the one\
  \ who always finds the shortest line, the best exit, the quickest solution. "I don't run. I\
  \ strategically disengage."
DARING_ESCAPE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't wait for rescue, doesn't trust that someone will\
  \ come for him. He's seen too many people left behind, too many desperate last stands that led\
  \ nowhere. So he makes sure he always has a way out. Because in war, survivors aren't always the\
  \ best fighters - they're the best escape artists.

DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.label=Doomsday Prepper
DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just prepare for combat - he prepares for\
  \ everything. EMP strikes, total infrastructure collapse, a sudden rebellion - he has plans for all\
  \ of it. "Laugh all you want, but when the comms go dark and the supply lines fail, I'll be the\
  \ one still standing."
DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's mech has extra rations, fuel reserves, emergency power\
  \ cells, and a dozen weapons that aren't standard issue. He doesn't just fight battles - he\
  \ prepares to outlast wars. "You rely on logistics. I rely on myself."
DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry stockpiles and prepares because he knows that wars don't\
  \ end when people say they do. He's seen entire units abandoned, vehicles left to rot, warriors\
  \ forgotten by their own commanders. If everything collapses, he will not be one of the ones\
  \ left to die in the ruins.
DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't trust any system to work forever. He has redundant\
  \ power sources, hidden supply caches, and a list of fallback plans that leadership doesn't even\
  \ know about. "Oh, the main reactor failed? Good thing I stashed a spare energy cell where no one\
  \ thought to look."
DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has hidden stockpiles everywhere. Rations in the storage\
  \ bay, extra weapons in unmarked crates, an escape route planned for any disaster. People think\
  \ he's paranoid - until the first real crisis hits. "What do you mean you didn't pack three months'\
  \ worth of emergency food?"
DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry prepares not because he expects help, but because he's\
  \ learned that help doesn't come. He's seen entire outposts abandoned, warriors cut off and left\
  \ to fend for themselves. He will never let himself be that vulnerable again. If the world ends\
  \ tomorrow? He's ready.

EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.label=Scavenges for Gear
EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he loots. Every battle is a chance to\
  \ pick up better weapons, spare armor, or rare tech. If it's not nailed down, he's already\
  \ figuring out how to use it. "Waste not, want not. That guy's not using his boots anymore, so I\
  \ will."
EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't rely on supply chains. He's patched together\
  \ weapons from three different manufacturers, repurposed enemy tech, and turned scrap into\
  \ survival tools. "You trust requisitions. I trust whatever I can pull off a wrecked war machine."
EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has run dry before - been left without ammo, without\
  \ working equipment, without a damn chance. Now, he picks up everything he can, because he knows\
  \ the day will come when no one is resupplying him. And when that day comes? He'll be the only\
  \ one still armed.
EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry hoards spare parts, salvages damaged equipment, and can\
  \ fix a system using components that no one else thought were worth keeping. "You were gonna\
  \ throw this away? I just made it fully operational again."
EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has stashes everywhere. A forgotten crate of munitions, a\
  \ backup power cell, a nearly functional enemy targeting system he 'acquired'. When things go\
  \ wrong, he has what's needed. "Oh, now you need the part I 'shouldn't have taken'? Funny how\
  \ that works."
EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't scavenge for fun - he does it because he knows\
  \ supplies don't last forever. He's seen bases stripped bare, troops left defenseless, entire\
  \ operations collapse because no one had the foresight to keep extras. If war means fighting with\
  \ scraps, then he's making sure he has the best scraps available.

FRIEND_TO_FOES.label=Sympathetic to Enemies
FRIEND_TO_FOES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't fight with hatred - he fights because he has to. He\
  \ recognizes that the people on the other side aren't so different from him. "They've got orders.\
  \ We've got orders. The difference is who's left standing at the end."
FRIEND_TO_FOES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry isn't the type to shoot a retreating enemy, nor does he\
  \ take pleasure in victory. He fights only as much as necessary. "Not every enemy deserves to\
  \ die. Some of them are just trying to survive - same as us."
FRIEND_TO_FOES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry understands that war is politics, not personal. If things\
  \ had played out just a little differently, he might have been wearing their colors, following\
  \ their orders, killing his own people. That thought haunts him every time he pulls the trigger.
FRIEND_TO_FOES.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry studies enemy tactics, but not just for strategic\
  \ reasons - he wants to understand them. Their history, their motivations, their art. "You to beat\
  \ them? Try understanding why they're fighting in the first place."
FRIEND_TO_FOES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't see war as black and white. He believes that if\
  \ things changed, if people actually listened instead of just fighting endlessly, maybe they\
  \ wouldn't have to be enemies forever. "We've fought with worse people than them before. Who says\
  \ that can't change?"
FRIEND_TO_FOES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in good guys and bad guys anymore. He's\
  \ seen leaders give orders that waste lives like they mean nothing. He knows the ones dying in\
  \ the scrum - on both sides - are just pawns in someone else's war. And that realization is hard to\
  \ ignore.

GUNG_HO.label=Gung-Ho Attitude
GUNG_HO.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't wait for perfect conditions - he dives in\
  \ headfirst. While others are weighing options, he's already moving. "Sitting around won't win\
  \ this fight - hitting them first will!"
GUNG_HO.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry thrives in the chaos of war, treating every mission as a\
  \ personal challenge. The more dangerous the objective, the bigger his grin. "Oh, this is a bad\
  \ idea? Good. That makes it more fun."
GUNG_HO.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry pushes forward relentlessly, not just because he enjoys\
  \ combat, but because slowing down means thinking. And thinking means acknowledging just how much\
  \ this war has taken from him.
GUNG_HO.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't hesitate - he just acts. System failure? He's on it\
  \ before anyone finishes panicking. Major logistical issue? Already moving to fix it. "Less\
  \ talking, more doing."
GUNG_HO.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry takes on every task with full force. If there's a problem,\
  \ it's not an obstacle - it's a battle to be won. He refuses to approach any situation\
  \ half-heartedly.
GUNG_HO.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't stop moving because stopping means facing reality.\
  \ If he keeps acting like every moment is a fight, then he never has to process the nagging\
  \ thought that none of it will ever change.

INSPIRATIONAL_POET.label=Gives Inspirational Speeches
INSPIRATIONAL_POET.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just talk - he commands attention. Before a battle,\
  \ after a crushing loss, in the middle of a desperate fight, he speaks with a fire that makes\
  \ others believe they can win. "We aren't done yet. We never will be. Not until this fight is\
  \ ours."
INSPIRATIONAL_POET.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't let fear or doubt take hold - not on his watch.\
  \ When morale is at its lowest, when the enemy seems unstoppable, he stands tall, spitting\
  \ defiance in the face of despair. "They want us to quit. They think we'll break. But I say we\
  \ show them what happens when you push us too far."
INSPIRATIONAL_POET.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in blind optimism, but he's seen what\
  \ happens when soldiers lose hope. He speaks because someone has to, because if he doesn't, then\
  \ this war will swallow them whole before the next shot is even fired.
INSPIRATIONAL_POET.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry isn't just there to do his job - he holds people together.\
  \ When shifts get long, when the odds seem impossible, he's the one reminding everyone why they\
  \ keep going.
INSPIRATIONAL_POET.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry can make anything feel important and he makes sure\
  \ everyone knows that their work matters. "You think this is small? Nothing is small in war. The\
  \ moment we forget that is the moment we start losing."
INSPIRATIONAL_POET.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry isn't naturally optimistic, but he knows what happens when\
  \ people stop believing they can win. He talks, he inspires, because if he doesn't keep morale\
  \ up, then sooner or later, people will stop trying at all.

MEK_MATCHMAKER.label=Believes in Mek Compatibility
MEK_MATCHMAKER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't care about technical readouts or factory\
  \ settings - he knows when a unit feels right. If he's forced into something that doesn't match\
  \ him, he feels it immediately. "You don't pick a machine based on numbers. You feel which one\
  \ belongs to you."
MEK_MATCHMAKER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry can't fully prove his belief in machine compatibility, but\
  \ he knows it's real. He's seen people fight like legends in one machine, then struggle in\
  \ another. "Call it superstition if you want. All I know is, when you find your ride, everything\
  \ just works."
MEK_MATCHMAKER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has watched people fail catastrophically in machines that\
  \ didn't fit them, seen them hesitate for half a second too long because they weren't in sync. He\
  \ refuses to make that mistake. "The wrong machine will kill you faster than the enemy ever could."
MEK_MATCHMAKER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't think anyone can just step into any machine and\
  \ perform the same way. He's seen too many people struggle for no reason, only to immediately\
  \ improve when paired with the right unit. "It's not just equipment - it's a bond."
MEK_MATCHMAKER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry insists that machines have quirks, and some people sync\
  \ with them better than others. He notices who flows naturally with their unit and who is\
  \ constantly fighting it. "You don't just control it - you work with it. And if that doesn't\
  \ happen, you're in the wrong machine."
MEK_MATCHMAKER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't buy into standard assignments or universal\
  \ optimization. He's watched people fall apart in machines that didn't suit them, forced into\
  \ something they couldn't adapt to. And when they hesitated? They didn't survive. "You either\
  \ find the machine that matches you, or you die in the one that doesn't."

MISSILE_JUNKIE.label=Overkill Enthusiast
MISSILE_JUNKIE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry refuses to take half-measures. If something needs to go\
  \ down, it needs to stay down. He doesn't just eliminate threats - he obliterates them. "One shot?\
  \ Cute. I fired twenty just to be sure."
MISSILE_JUNKIE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just win fights - he ensures absolute destruction.\
  \ Whether it's an enemy force or an already-crippled target, he keeps firing. "If there's still\
  \ salvage left, I obviously didn't fire enough."
MISSILE_JUNKIE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in measured responses anymore. He's\
  \ watched people hesitate, watched squads get wiped out because they thought a single barrage was\
  \ enough. If he's firing, he's running till empty. If he's striking, he's leveling the whole damn\
  \ battlefield.
MISSILE_JUNKIE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in minimalist solutions. If something\
  \ needs fixing, he reinforces it beyond reason. If something needs supplies, he orders triple the\
  \ requirement. "Redundancy? No. This is just common sense."
MISSILE_JUNKIE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry refuses to do anything halfway. If he's organizing\
  \ something, it's flawless. If he's preparing for something, he's over-prepared. "You think this\
  \ is too much? That's just because you've never really been ready for anything."
MISSILE_JUNKIE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't push things to excess because he wants to - he does\
  \ it because he's seen entire operations fail because people only did the minimum required. If he\
  \ does something, he makes damn sure there's no chance of failure. "I don't do 'just enough.' I\
  \ do what actually works."

NEVER_RETREAT.label=Hates to Give Up
NEVER_RETREAT.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in lost causes. As long as he's\
  \ breathing, he's still in the fight. He'll push forward even when logic, reason, and survival\
  \ instincts say to fall back. "You think it's over? Not until I say it is."
NEVER_RETREAT.description.1.COMBATANT=When others are ready to retreat, Barry is already planning his\
  \ next move. No matter how hopeless the situation looks, he refuses to stop. "We've lost when\
  \ we're dead. And last time I checked, we're still breathing."
NEVER_RETREAT.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen what happens to those who give up. They don't\
  \ get mercy, they don't get a second chance. They get erased. He fights because stopping isn't an\
  \ option. "Giving up isn't survival. It's just choosing to lose slower."
NEVER_RETREAT.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't accept failure as an answer. If a situation looks\
  \ unsalvageable, he doubles down, working harder, pushing past exhaustion until he finds a way.\
  \ "It's not impossible. We just haven't figured out how yet."
NEVER_RETREAT.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has zero patience for people who say something can't be\
  \ done. He'll stay up as long as it takes, trying every method, every angle, until he forces a\
  \ solution into existence. "I don't fail. I solve problems. Even if it takes forever."
NEVER_RETREAT.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has watched people give up - on their work, on their fight,\
  \ on themselves. He's seen them fade away, crushed by war. That will not be him. He pushes on\
  \ because stopping means accepting defeat, and Barry does not accept defeat.

OPTIMISTIC_TO_A_FAULT.label=Optimistic to a Fault
OPTIMISTIC_TO_A_FAULT.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry refuses to see a fight as unwinnable. Outnumbered? That\
  \ just means more targets. Outgunned? They'll run out of ammo first. His confidence is\
  \ unshakable, even when reality says otherwise. "We just need one good break. And trust me - it's\
  \ coming."
OPTIMISTIC_TO_A_FAULT.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just stay positive - he acts like things are going\
  \ great even when they absolutely aren't. He could be the last one standing, surrounded,\
  \ bleeding, and still smirking. "We've got 'em right where we want 'em!"
OPTIMISTIC_TO_A_FAULT.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has to believe there's hope, because if he stops\
  \ believing, what's left? He's seen what happens to those who accept reality for what it is. They\
  \ stop fighting. They give up. He refuses to let that happen to him. "No, we aren't doomed. No,\
  \ we aren't done. Not while I'm still standing."
OPTIMISTIC_TO_A_FAULT.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry refuses to accept unsolvable problems. Even when things\
  \ are falling apart, he keeps pushing forward, convinced there's always a way to fix things.\
  \ "Don't say 'it's impossible.' Say 'we haven't figured it out yet.'"
OPTIMISTIC_TO_A_FAULT.description.1.SUPPORT=No matter how bad things get, Barry insists that it's not that\
  \ bad - sometimes to the frustration of everyone else. "Sure, everything's broken, the situation is\
  \ dire, and we're completely unprepared, but think of the upside!"
OPTIMISTIC_TO_A_FAULT.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry knows the truth of war, but he refuses to let it break\
  \ him. He stays positive because he's seen what happens when people stop believing things can get\
  \ better. If that means lying to himself just to keep going, then so be it. "We'll be fine. We\
  \ have to be fine."

REACTIVE.label=High Strung
REACTIVE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't do calm. Even when things aren't urgent, he's\
  \ tense, wired, ready to react. Every noise, every movement, every shift on the battlefield is\
  \ something he's already preparing for. "Relax? We're in a warzone. Relax after we survive."
REACTIVE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in safe moments. If things are too quiet,\
  \ if an operation is going smoothly, he starts getting worse, not better. "Something's wrong.\
  \ It's too easy. Too clean. There's always something waiting."
REACTIVE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry knows what happens to those who get too comfortable. He's\
  \ seen it, lived through it. One second, everything's fine. The next, it's over. He stays on edge\
  \ because he refuses to be caught off guard like that again.
REACTIVE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in small problems. If something is off,\
  \ it's one step away from catastrophe. Every system failure, every missing supply, every\
  \ unexplained noise needs to be fixed immediately. "This isn't just a glitch. This is how things\
  \ start falling apart."
REACTIVE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't do calm. If nothing is happening, he's still\
  \ tense, still scanning the room, still bracing for something to go wrong. "You're all too\
  \ relaxed. Something's about to happen - I know it."
REACTIVE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry isn't paranoid. He's experienced. He's seen good people\
  \ die because they trusted things would work out. He refuses to make that mistake. If he has to\
  \ carry the weight of constant vigilance, then so be it. "I'd rather be wrong a hundred times\
  \ than right just once when it's too late."

RISK_TAKER.label=Extreme Risk Taker
RISK_TAKER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in safe bets. If there's a reckless,\
  \ high-stakes move that could turn the tide, he's already going for it. "Sure, there's a safer\
  \ way. But this way's faster, riskier, and way more fun."
RISK_TAKER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry sees hesitation as worse than failure. The only way to\
  \ win is to take risks others won't. He thrives in desperate situations, the kind where only\
  \ madmen or legends make it out alive. "They think I'm crazy. They just don't understand what it\
  \ takes to win."
RISK_TAKER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't take risks because he wants to live - he takes them\
  \ because he's already made peace with dying. He pushes forward recklessly, making impossible\
  \ plays, because in his mind, he was never going to make it out of this war alive anyway.
RISK_TAKER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry never follows standard procedure when a faster, more\
  \ dangerous approach exists. He tests theories mid-operation, takes huge gambles on untested\
  \ ideas, and never waits for permission. "Calculated risks? Boring. Let's just see what happens."
RISK_TAKER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry hates slow, cautious approaches. If there's a shortcut\
  \ that might work, he's taking it. If there's a wild, untested alternative, he's all in. "Yeah,\
  \ yeah, it might backfire. But if it doesn't, we just saved a ton of time."
RISK_TAKER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't trust careful planning because he's seen how\
  \ quickly everything falls apart no matter what precautions you take. If everything is destined\
  \ to fail eventually, why not push every decision to its absolute limit? "Caution won't save you\
  \ when the end comes. Taking action might."

SIGNATURE_MOVE.label=Has a Signature Move
SIGNATURE_MOVE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he performs. Every battle, every\
  \ engagement, he executes his move, something distinct, unmistakable, his own. "If they survive,\
  \ they'll remember exactly who did it."
SIGNATURE_MOVE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't care if it's tactically efficient - what matters is\
  \ style, impact, and recognition. If he's going to win, he's going to do it his way. "If they\
  \ don't know it's me by how I fight, then I'm not fighting right."
SIGNATURE_MOVE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just want to win - he wants to be remembered. He\
  \ carves his identity into combat itself, ensuring that even if he doesn't make it out, his\
  \ technique, his legacy, his name will live on. "If I fall, they'll still be talking about me\
  \ years from now."
SIGNATURE_MOVE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just do things - he does them his way. Whether it's\
  \ a specific technique, a ritualized habit, or an unmistakable style, everything he touches feels\
  \ like him. "If you don't recognize my work when you see it, then I'm doing something wrong."
SIGNATURE_MOVE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in generic solutions. His way of solving\
  \ problems, fixing things, or handling challenges is something unique to him - and it always works.\
  \ "Anyone can do the job. I make it look good while I'm at it."
SIGNATURE_MOVE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen too many people fade into nothing, their stories,\
  \ their impact erased by time and war. He refuses to be just another worker, just another body.\
  \ His signature move is more than just habit - it's a way to make sure no one forgets he was here.

TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.label=Withdraws from Conflict
TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't see retreat as cowardice - he sees it as strategy.\
  \ If a fight isn't worth it, if there's a smarter way out, he'll take it. "Survival isn't about\
  \ winning every fight. It's about knowing which ones to walk away from."
TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't engage in pointless fights. He picks his moments,\
  \ waits for the right time, and doesn't waste energy on clashes that don't matter. "Let them wear\
  \ themselves out. I'll be here when it actually matters."
TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't withdraw because he's afraid - he withdraws because\
  \ he's tired. He's seen too many fights, too much bloodshed, and he knows how easily lives are\
  \ thrown away for nothing. If he walks away, it's because he values his survival more than\
  \ someone else's idea of honor.
TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't waste his time on pointless debates or petty\
  \ disputes. He'll listen, nod, and then quietly walk away, letting others fight while he moves\
  \ on. "You all let me know when you're done yelling. I'll be over here actually getting things\
  \ done."
TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has no patience for drama, politics, or endless conflicts.\
  \ If something is going nowhere, he removes himself before it can drag him down too. "You want to\
  \ argue for hours? Be my guest. I've got better things to do."
TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has watched people destroy themselves over pointless\
  \ grudges, needless rivalries, and unwinnable battles. He refuses to become another casualty to\
  \ someone else's pride. If stepping away means staying alive, then that's exactly what he'll do.

ACCENT_SWITCHER.label=Switches Accents Randomly
ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's speech patterns are completely unpredictable. One\
  \ moment, he's speaking with a crisp, formal tone; the next, he's dropped into a thick drawl or\
  \ clipped military jargon. "Aye, lad, ye best watch yer flank - oh, wait, I mean, move your ass\
  \ before they frag you."
ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry never explains why he does it, but he'll slip into\
  \ different accents at the worst possible times. It's hard to tell if it's deliberate\
  \ misdirection or just habit. "Reckon we hit 'em hard, real cowboy style - or perhaps a more\
  \ refined approach is in order, oui?"
ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has spent too long in too many places, surrounded by too\
  \ many different voices. He picks up accents without thinking, blending in, shifting, changing.\
  \ If he still remembers his real voice, he never lets it show. "I've been a lot of people. I\
  \ don't even know which one's actually me anymore."
ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's colleagues have given up trying to figure out his\
  \ origins. One day he sounds like a noble diplomat, the next he's speaking like he just walked\
  \ out of a frontier settlement. "Oh, sugar, don't worry none, I got it fixed - wait, pardon,\
  \ monsieur, I meant to say, the issue has been resolved."
ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't even realize when he does it. Sometimes he'll slip\
  \ into an accent mid-conversation and act like nothing happened. When called out on it? He just\
  \ shrugs. "Well, ain't that just your perception, mate?"
ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't force the accent changes - they happen on their own.\
  \ He's lived too many lives, in too many places, and his voice reflects all of them. It's not a\
  \ quirk - it's a reminder that he's never really belonged anywhere for long.

AMBUSH_LOVER.label=Walks Softly
AMBUSH_LOVER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't stomp around like others do. His footsteps are\
  \ light, calculated, deliberate. One moment, he's across the room; the next, he's right behind\
  \ you. "You hear that? No? Exactly."
AMBUSH_LOVER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't see the point in announcing his presence. Every\
  \ movement is controlled, every step soft. While others crash forward, he's already maneuvering\
  \ unseen. "Loud gets you killed. Quiet lets you choose when to strike."
AMBUSH_LOVER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen enough ambushes, enough betrayals, enough\
  \ slaughter to know that noise only makes you a target. He doesn't move loudly because he still\
  \ wants to be alive at the end of the day. "The moment they hear you, they've already decided\
  \ you're dead."
AMBUSH_LOVER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry moves without sound, without warning, and it startles\
  \ everyone. One second the room is empty; the next, he's just there. "I swear, Barry, you've got\
  \ to stop sneaking up on people." "...I walked in like normal."
AMBUSH_LOVER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't intentionally lurk, but he's quiet enough that\
  \ people constantly forget he's around. Conversations stop abruptly when he finally talks. "Oh,\
  \ wow - Barry, I didn't even know you were here." "Yeah. I get that a lot."
AMBUSH_LOVER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't move loudly because he knows better. Being heard,\
  \ being seen, being noticed? That's just an invitation for trouble. He's learned that the longer\
  \ he stays quiet, the more likely he is to make it through whatever's coming next. "The moment\
  \ they forget you're there, you've already won."

BATTLE_HARDENED.label=Battle-Hardened Stoic
BATTLE_HARDENED.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't flinch at incoming fire, surprise ambushes, or\
  \ desperate last stands. He's been through worse, and he never lets it show. "Panic won't save\
  \ you. Keep moving."
BATTLE_HARDENED.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't waste words on complaints, bravado, or false\
  \ hope. He fights, he endures, he survives, and that's all there is to it. "Talk later. Fight\
  \ now."
BATTLE_HARDENED.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't let himself feel anymore, not like he used to.\
  \ He's watched too many people die, too many wars grind on without meaning. If he stops to\
  \ process it, it'll break him. So he doesn't. "Keep your head down. Keep moving. Nothing else\
  \ matters."
BATTLE_HARDENED.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry stays calm under pressure, never raising his voice, never\
  \ letting stress crack through. Alarms blaring? Still focused. People panicking? He's already\
  \ handling the problem. "Losing your head won't fix it. Focus."
BATTLE_HARDENED.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't whine, grumble, or overreact. If something is bad,\
  \ he deals with it. If something is really bad, he deals with it harder. "Yeah. It's bad. So fix\
  \ it."
BATTLE_HARDENED.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry used to care, used to feel. But war doesn't care, and\
  \ eventually, he learned to stop wasting energy on emotions no one had time for. If something's\
  \ wrong, he fixes it. If something hurts, he pushes through it. "Pain means you're still alive.\
  \ That's all it means."

BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.label=Breaks Radio Silence
BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry understands the importance of stealth and discipline, but\
  \ he just can't help himself. The squad is moving in total silence when suddenly: "Hey, anyone\
  \ else think this is way too quiet?"
BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry hates absolute silence. It makes his skin crawl, sets his\
  \ nerves on edge. He'll risk whispering, muttering, or making a joke just to break the tension.\
  \ "Radio's dead silent? Yeah, okay, now I'm worried."
BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has been there - the silence stretching on too long, the\
  \ slow realization that no one's responding. If he speaks, it's because he needs to hear someone\
  \ answer back. "Someone say something. Just... anything. I don't care what."
BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry knows when to keep his mouth shut. He just doesn't care.\
  \ If the channel is dead silent for too long, he'll drop in with something completely unnecessary.\
  \ "Sooo... what do you think the chances are that we aren't walking into a trap?"
BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't like silence. It feels unnatural, wrong, too\
  \ empty. If no one else is talking, he'll fill the void, even if it gets him in trouble. "Okay,\
  \ but hypothetically, if I were to just start humming right now - "
BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry knows exactly what it feels like to wait on the other end\
  \ of a dead radio, to call out and hear nothing in return. He talks because if he doesn't, he'll\
  \ start wondering if he's the last one left. "Radio check. Someone say something. Now."

CONVOY_LOVER.label=Prefers Convoy Missions
CONVOY_LOVER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't see convoy missions as boring logistics - he sees\
  \ them as a real test of skill. Protecting a moving force, managing ambush points, bottlenecks,\
  \ and chokepoints - to him, that's the real game. "Stationary fights are predictable. Convoy\
  \ missions? That's where you prove you know what you're doing."
CONVOY_LOVER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry likes that convoy missions matter. There's something\
  \ different about ensuring something critical gets through, rather than just destroying a target.\
  \ "You're not just fighting to win. You're fighting to deliver something that matters."
CONVOY_LOVER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has watched convoy missions go horribly wrong. He's seen\
  \ supply lines torn apart, civilian transports ambushed, key assets lost forever. He takes them\
  \ personally now. "Convoy's getting through. No matter what. No matter what."
CONVOY_LOVER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry enjoys the rhythm of a convoy. The movement, the\
  \ preparation, the precision. There's something about logistics in motion that makes sense to\
  \ him. "Nothing's better than a well-organized convoy rolling like a well-oiled machine."
CONVOY_LOVER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just care about getting somewhere - he enjoys the\
  \ process of getting there. The planning, the movement, the sense of progress. "A base is just a\
  \ place. The mission? That's a story unfolding in real time."
CONVOY_LOVER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry understands that war isn't won by battles - it's won by\
  \ supply lines. He's seen what happens when a convoy doesn't make it. He knows that everything\
  \ collapses when the supplies stop coming. "Fights don't matter if the people fighting don't have\
  \ what they need. Convoy goes through. End of discussion."

CAMOUFLAGE.label=Likes to Blend In
CAMOUFLAGE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he makes sure his gear is invisible\
  \ until it's too late. From terrain-matching coatings to active concealment tricks, he takes\
  \ hiding his equipment as seriously as he takes the fight itself. "If they don't see it coming,\
  \ they don't get a chance to react. That's the whole point."
CAMOUFLAGE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in standard color schemes or obvious\
  \ silhouettes. His equipment always matches the terrain - dust-covered in deserts, ice-slicked in\
  \ tundras, urban-camouflaged in cities. "Standing out is just asking to get shot first."
CAMOUFLAGE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has watched people die because they stood out, because\
  \ their gear wasn't hidden well enough. He learned the hard way that survival is about not being\
  \ seen at all. "If they see you first, you're already dead. Hide everything. Always."
CAMOUFLAGE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry refuses to leave anything exposed. He'll cover, blend, and\
  \ disguise anything that could be spotted from a distance. If something stands out, he fixes it\
  \ immediately. "Survival starts with us not being noticed at all."
CAMOUFLAGE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry moves through situations without fanfare. He's not\
  \ invisible, but people rarely notice when he arrives or leaves - just that things seem to run more\
  \ smoothly when he's around. "Oh, Barry was here? Yeah. That makes sense."
CAMOUFLAGE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has watched others rise up, make names for themselves - only\
  \ to be cut down first when things go bad. He's learned that staying unnoticed is the safest way\
  \ to survive. "The nail that sticks out gets hammered down. I prefer not to be the nail."

DISTANT_LEADER.label=Leads from a Distance
DISTANT_LEADER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't shout orders from the front - he positions himself\
  \ where he can see everything, analyzing movements, making precise calls. "You don't lead by\
  \ charging in. You lead by making sure everyone gets through alive."
DISTANT_LEADER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't need spotlights, titles, or recognition to lead.\
  \ His voice is calm, his directions are measured, and he ensures his team is always positioned\
  \ for success. "I don't need to be in front. I just need to be in control of the field."
DISTANT_LEADER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry knows what happens to leaders who put themselves in the\
  \ thick of every fight. He's buried too many of them. He stays just far enough back to keep\
  \ control, to make sure his people don't die for nothing. "You want to be the hero? Go ahead.\
  \ I'll make sure the rest of us survive."
DISTANT_LEADER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't hover or demand attention - he sets things in\
  \ motion, gives clear direction, and lets things unfold as planned. "You don't need to be in the\
  \ middle of everything to keep it running. You just need to know how to steer it from where you\
  \ are."
DISTANT_LEADER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry is the kind of person who gives advice, direction, and\
  \ strategy, then steps right back into the background. He doesn't need people to follow him\
  \ explicitly - he just makes sure they know where to go. "I don't need credit. I just need this to\
  \ work."
DISTANT_LEADER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen leaders charge forward and never come back. He's\
  \ watched too many put themselves at the center of things and get ripped apart. He stays where he\
  \ can be most useful, which means not dying for a symbol. "I lead from here because if I don't,\
  \ there won't be anyone left to lead."

DRAMATIC_FINISH.label=Prefers Dramatic Finishes
DRAMATIC_FINISH.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just win - he makes sure everyone remembers how he\
  \ won. He times his final moves perfectly, adding a sense of style to every encounter. "Anyone\
  \ can win. Not everyone can make it look good."
DRAMATIC_FINISH.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry knows the fight is his, but he waits - lining up the\
  \ perfect shot, setting up a final strike that leaves no doubt. If it doesn't feel cinematic, it\
  \ wasn't done right. "It's not just about beating them. It's about ending it in a way they'll\
  \ never forget."
DRAMATIC_FINISH.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry refuses to let his fights be just another skirmish. He's\
  \ seen too many battles blend together, too many victories that feel hollow. If he's going to\
  \ fight, then the ending better damn well be worth it. "If this is going to be another day of\
  \ war, I'm going to make sure the last second actually matters."
DRAMATIC_FINISH.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just complete things - he ensures that the ending\
  \ feels significant. Whether it's a final word, a well-timed reveal, or a perfect conclusion, he\
  \ knows how to leave an impression. "No, no, no. You can't just finish it. You have to stick the\
  \ landing."
DRAMATIC_FINISH.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry hates anticlimaxes. If something is wrapping up, he will\
  \ make sure it happens with flare, weight, and the perfect sense of timing. "You don't just fade\
  \ out. You make sure the last thing they see is the part they'll remember."
DRAMATIC_FINISH.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has watched people disappear, missions end without\
  \ closure, lives lost without significance. He refuses to let his own moments fade into\
  \ obscurity. Every ending needs impact - because if it doesn't, then what was the point of\
  \ anything? "If this all has to end, then damn it, it better end in a way that lasts."

ENGINE_REVERER.label=Emphatic with Technology
ENGINE_REVERER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't see machines as lifeless tools - he treats them\
  \ with respect, patience, and understanding. He swears his weapons fight better when he\
  \ acknowledges them properly. "A machine isn't just metal and circuits. It knows when you trust\
  \ it - and when you don't."
ENGINE_REVERER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry has seen too many people abuse their gear, rush their\
  \ startup sequences, ignore the warning hum of a system under stress. He refuses to do the same.\
  \ "You listen to it, you learn from it, and it will take care of you in return."
ENGINE_REVERER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't think failures are random. He's watched unworthy\
  \ hands try to control machines they didn't respect, and watched those machines betray them in\
  \ their moment of need. "Call it superstition. But if you don't show your machine respect, one\
  \ day, it won't be there when you need it most."
ENGINE_REVERER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry never just interacts with technology - he communicates with\
  \ it. Whether it's a quick word of encouragement, a gentle pat on the side of a console, or a\
  \ quiet thank you, he believes it matters. "You'd be amazed what a little appreciation does.\
  \ Machines like being treated well."
ENGINE_REVERER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry swears different machines have different moods. Some are\
  \ stubborn, some are temperamental, and some respond to kindness. If something refuses to work,\
  \ he doesn't assume it's broken - he assumes it's upset. "Give it a second. It's just being\
  \ difficult today. Happens to everyone."
ENGINE_REVERER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry knows too many people who treated their machines like\
  \ soulless tools - and they're gone now. Maybe it's coincidence. Maybe it's not. But he's not going\
  \ to take that chance. "Machines remember. They know who respects them, and they know who\
  \ doesn't."

FLIRTY_COMMS.label=Flirts Over Comms
FLIRTY_COMMS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry never lets the chaos of battle stop him from throwing in\
  \ a well-timed flirt. Explosions in the background? Enemy fire raining down? He's still casually\
  \ complimenting someone's voice over the comms. "You know, if we survive this, you owe me dinner\
  \ for saving your ass just now."
FLIRTY_COMMS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry knows the situation is serious, but that doesn't mean he\
  \ can't have a little fun. Whether it's teasing an ally or shamelessly charming the enemy, he\
  \ keeps things light. "Your targeting is getting better. Or are you just trying to impress me?"
FLIRTY_COMMS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry knows that every battle might be his last. So why not\
  \ enjoy himself while he can? If he's going out, he's going out with a smirk and a last-minute\
  \ confession. "If this is it, I need you to know... I've always looked great doing this."
FLIRTY_COMMS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry can be discussing critical situations, but that won't stop\
  \ him from dropping a playful remark or two. Whether it's mock admiration or genuine charm, he\
  \ makes sure no conversation is boring. "That's a beautiful comms setup you've got there. But not\
  \ as beautiful as the voice coming through it."
FLIRTY_COMMS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has a gift for casually throwing out flirtatious remarks\
  \ with zero hesitation. Half the time, people aren't even sure if he means it. "Oh, you sound\
  \ stressed. Want me to whisper sweet nothings about how competent you are?" They're not always\
  \ appropriate.
FLIRTY_COMMS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't flirt just to entertain himself - he does it because\
  \ the alternative is silence. He keeps things playful because if he stops, he has to think about\
  \ what happens when there's no one left to talk to at all. "Don't go quiet on me now. Who else am\
  \ I supposed to charm while the world falls apart?"

FOCUS_FREAK.label=Hyper-Focused Under Pressure
FOCUS_FREAK.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't crack under pressure - he sharpens. When everything\
  \ is going wrong, when the chaos is at its peak, he locks in, making perfect calls and impossibly\
  \ fast reactions. "Panicking won't save you. Thinking faster than the enemy will."
FOCUS_FREAK.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry might be distracted, restless, or even reckless when\
  \ things are calm, but the moment the situation turns critical, he's all focus. No wasted\
  \ movements, no unnecessary words - just pure, disciplined action. "Everything else? Doesn't matter\
  \ right now. We do this, and we survive."
FOCUS_FREAK.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has watched hesitation get people killed. He's seen what\
  \ happens when fear takes over. So when things get bad, he shuts everything out, narrowing down\
  \ to what needs to happen to stay alive. "If you stop to think about how bad it is, it's already\
  \ too late."
FOCUS_FREAK.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry might be laid back or unfocused when things are normal,\
  \ but when things start falling apart, he's suddenly the most competent person in the room. No\
  \ hesitation, no wasted energy - just pure execution. "You can freak out after we fix this. Right\
  \ now, we get it done."
FOCUS_FREAK.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry shuts out distractions, ignores the noise, and locks in on\
  \ the task at hand. When the stakes are high, he works with a speed and intensity that almost\
  \ doesn't seem possible. "Everything else? Irrelevant. We get through this first. Then you can\
  \ breathe."
FOCUS_FREAK.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't focus because he wants to - he focuses because\
  \ failure isn't an option. He's seen what happens when things aren't handled fast enough, when\
  \ mistakes slip through, when people hesitate. "You think you have time to worry? You don't. Do\
  \ it right now or don't do it at all."

FOUL_MOUTHED.label=Foul-Mouthed
FOUL_MOUTHED.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's comms are a constant stream of expletives, whether he's\
  \ frustrated, excited, or just having a normal conversation. His insults are creative, effective,\
  \ and completely unfiltered. "Oh, for ****'s sake, that's the worst shooting I've ever seen! Do\
  \ I need to ****ing hold your hand out here?"
FOUL_MOUTHED.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just swear - he weaponizes it. His profanity is so\
  \ aggressive that it either rallies his allies or completely rattles his enemies. "Listen here,\
  \ you miserable pack of rusted ****-stains, either you run now or I'll show you what a real\
  \ ****ing disaster looks like."
FOUL_MOUTHED.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry used to care about how he spoke, about keeping things\
  \ professional. But war has burned that away. Now, his language is raw, brutal, and\
  \ honest - because what's the point in holding back? "I don't have time for your ****ing optimism.\
  \ We're knee-deep in **** and unless you stop talking and start shooting, we're going to die in\
  \ it."
FOUL_MOUTHED.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry can't do anything without a few choice words. Whether he's\
  \ talking to himself, complaining about a minor inconvenience, or offering 'constructive\
  \ feedback', he's always swearing. "Oh, you've got to be ****ing kidding me. Who the **** put\
  \ this together? A ****ing blindfolded toddler?!"
FOUL_MOUTHED.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's tone barely changes between casual conversation and\
  \ absolute rage, making it nearly impossible to tell when he's genuinely furious or just talking\
  \ normally. "Yeah, yeah, we'll get it done. Relax. Stop looking at me like that, this is just how\
  \ I ****ing talk."
FOUL_MOUTHED.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't dress things up, doesn't soften the truth. He\
  \ calls things exactly as they are, and if that means dropping more expletives than actual words,\
  \ so be it. "You want me to phrase it nicely? Fine. We're totally ****ed."

FREESTYLE_COMBAT.label=Has a Freestyle Approach
FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't do structured plans or textbook strategies. He\
  \ improvises on the fly, adjusting as the fight unfolds, reacting faster than anyone expects.\
  \ "Look, I could follow protocol, or I could just do what actually works. Guess which one I'm\
  \ picking?"
FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry trusts instinct over orders, flow over formation. His\
  \ style is chaotic but effective, and somehow, it keeps working. "Plans fall apart. Tactics get\
  \ countered. You know what doesn't? Thinking faster than the other guy."
FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry used to follow orders, used to stick to the doctrine. But\
  \ he's watched it fail, seen people die because they did what they were told instead of what\
  \ actually needed to be done. Now? He adapts, or he dies. "You want me to follow the plan\
  \ exactly? Then tell me how that worked out for the last poor bastard who tried it."
FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't care about standard procedures or official\
  \ methods. If there's a faster, more efficient, or completely unconventional way to do something,\
  \ he's already doing it. "Oh, you wanted it done properly? No. I got it done right."
FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has no patience for needless steps or bureaucratic\
  \ nonsense. He finds solutions in the moment, working on instinct rather than instructions. "You\
  \ want a process? Fine. Here's my process: I make it work."
FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't trust manuals, procedures, or carefully written\
  \ guidelines. He's seen too many people waste time following the rules while everything burned\
  \ around them. He works fast, loose, and with no hesitation - because that's what keeps people\
  \ alive. "You can either waste time doing it the right way, or you can do it my way and actually\
  \ survive this."

GEOMETRY_GURU.label=Geometry Guru
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he calculates. Every shot, every\
  \ movement, every approach is based on angles, arcs, and positioning. "You don't just fire - you\
  \ predict. You don't just move - you control the space."
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry never fires blindly; every shot is lined up, ricocheted,\
  \ or angled for maximum impact. He treats the battlefield like a perfectly plotted\
  \ three-dimensional puzzle. "Everything has a weak spot. You just have to find the right angle to\
  \ exploit it."
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust luck, instinct, or blind aggression. He\
  \ trusts geometry. He's seen how battles turn into chaos, how emotions get people killed - but\
  \ angles? Angles don't lie. "It's not about winning. It's about solving for X. And in this case,\
  \ X is the fastest way to make them not my problem."
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry can't unsee geometry in everything. The way things align,\
  \ the way efficiency improves when angles are perfect, the mathematical beauty of well-organized\
  \ space. "You don't just put things down randomly. You optimize them."
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has a habit of breaking down even the simplest things into\
  \ mathematical terms. Whether it's lining up objects, explaining movement patterns, or analyzing\
  \ layouts, he's always thinking in angles. "Look, you could do it that way, but if you shift it\
  \ 17 degrees, you'll maximize efficiency by at least 12%."
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry finds comfort in numbers, angles, and predictable\
  \ calculations because everything else is chaos. He can't control the war, the losses, the\
  \ destruction - but he can control how things align, how things flow, how everything fits into\
  \ place. "The world falls apart, people die, plans fail. But geometry? Geometry is perfect."

ICE_COLD.label=Emotionless in Crisis
ICE_COLD.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't panic, doesn't flinch, doesn't react to chaos\
  \ like everyone else does. Whether it's losing an advantage, being outnumbered, or watching\
  \ allies fall, he just keeps moving. "Fear won't save you. Acting will."
ICE_COLD.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry speaks in the same steady, flat tone whether he's giving\
  \ orders, dodging fire, or watching a disaster unfold. He operates like a machine, precise and\
  \ deliberate, even as everything around him burns. "We handle it. That's all. Doesn't matter how\
  \ bad it looks."
ICE_COLD.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has watched panic kill more people than bullets. He's\
  \ buried leaders who froze up, warriors who hesitated, teams who lost control. He learned long\
  \ ago that shutting it all out is the only way to make it through. "Doesn't matter how bad it is.\
  \ I'll deal with it. Because I always do."
ICE_COLD.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't rush, panic, or even raise his voice when things\
  \ go wrong. He simply assesses the problem, executes the next step, and moves forward. "Crisis?\
  \ No. It's just a situation that needs handling."
ICE_COLD.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's voice stays calm and even while everyone else is losing\
  \ their minds. It doesn't matter how bad things get - his response is always unshaken, controlled,\
  \ and matter-of-fact. "Yeah, it's bad. No, that doesn't change what we need to do."
ICE_COLD.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry used to feel more, used to let himself react. But he's\
  \ seen too many people lose control, seen how fast things spiral the moment someone lets fear in.\
  \ Now, he keeps it buried - because survival demands it. "You think staying calm is easy? No. But\
  \ it's the only reason I'm still here."

PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.label=Extremely Picky
PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry won't just take any weapon, mech, or gear - he has\
  \ preferences, and he sticks to them religiously. If something isn't precisely the way he likes\
  \ it, he won't touch it. "No. That's wrong. Too heavy, wrong grip, balance is off. Get me the\
  \ right one.
PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry will absolutely fight in whatever conditions he has to,\
  \ but that doesn't mean he won't voice his disappointment the entire time. Whether it's loadout\
  \ choices, terrain, or enemy tactics, he has opinions. "You call this a firing position? No\
  \ cover, bad angles, and don't get me started on the damn wind."
PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen people die because they settled for "good\
  \ enough". He refuses to make that mistake. If something isn't exactly right, it's wrong, and he\
  \ won't compromise. "Precision isn't optional. You think I'm difficult? Fine. At least I'll still\
  \ be alive."
PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry has preferences for everything - how things are arranged,\
  \ how people talk, how tasks should be done. If something is off by even a fraction, he'll notice\
  \ it immediately. "No, absolutely not. That's three degrees off-center, and now it's all ruined."
PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just complain - he fixes things. If something isn't\
  \ up to his personal standard, he'll redo it from scratch. "Look, I don't trust anyone else to do\
  \ it right. Just let me handle it before I lose my mind."
PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry wasn't always this particular, but he's seen what happens\
  \ when people let things slide. Small mistakes lead to bigger ones, and bigger mistakes get\
  \ people killed. He refuses to be another casualty of carelessness. "You think it doesn't matter?\
  \ That's what they said before everything went to hell."

RECORD_KEEPER.label=Statistics Nerd
RECORD_KEEPER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just react in combat - he analyzes. Every shot,\
  \ every maneuver, every decision is backed by numbers and probability models. "The odds of that\
  \ working are less than 12%, but sure, let's pretend luck is real."
RECORD_KEEPER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry has a fact or figure for every situation, whether it's\
  \ accuracy rates, survival odds, or enemy engagement trends. He never just trusts intuition.\
  \ "Statistically speaking, you should already be dead. But hey, keep doing whatever it is you\
  \ call 'strategy.'"
RECORD_KEEPER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust gut feelings or heroics - he trusts data.\
  \ He's watched people make emotional decisions, and he's seen how that ends. He survives because\
  \ he follows the numbers. "Your instincts don't mean ****. The data says this is a bad idea. I'm\
  \ listening to the data."
RECORD_KEEPER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry has a number for everything. If something has happened\
  \ before, been studied, or analyzed, he knows the probability of it happening again - and he will\
  \ bring it up. "Based on historical trends, there's a 76% chance this will fail exactly the same\
  \ way as last time."
RECORD_KEEPER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry will correct you if you're exaggerating, estimating\
  \ wildly, or misrepresenting statistics. He doesn't care if it's annoying - he cares about\
  \ accuracy. "Actually, you're off by 3.7%, but sure, let's round it up and pretend that's fine."
RECORD_KEEPER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has stopped believing in luck, instincts, or gut feelings.\
  \ He's seen too many people bet on hope and lose. The numbers are cold, cruel, and unforgiving,\
  \ but at least they don't lie to you. "Hope gets people killed. Statistics tell you when they're\
  \ going to die."

RESOURCE_SCROUNGER.label=Resourceful
RESOURCE_SCROUNGER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't panic when things go wrong - he adapts. Running low\
  \ on ammo? He's already found an alternative. Outnumbered? He's using the terrain to even the\
  \ odds. "Doesn't matter what we have. What matters is how we use it."
RESOURCE_SCROUNGER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry never sees himself as out of options. If something looks\
  \ useless, it just means he hasn't figured out how to use it yet. "A bad position? No, it's a\
  \ perfect trap if you know how to set it up."
RESOURCE_SCROUNGER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't expect resupplies, doesn't assume backup is\
  \ coming. He's seen what happens when people rely on things they can't control. If he's going to\
  \ survive, it'll be because he made something out of nothing. "War doesn't care what you don't\
  \ have. You fight with what's in front of you, or you die waiting for something better."
RESOURCE_SCROUNGER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in impossible problems. If something\
  \ can't be done, he finds another way. His solutions are unconventional, creative, and sometimes\
  \ reckless, but they always work. "If the rulebook says it can't be done, the rulebook is wrong."
RESOURCE_SCROUNGER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't need ideal circumstances - he excels in the worst\
  \ ones. Whether it's repurposing old materials, finding alternatives, or just knowing exactly\
  \ what to prioritize, he gets it done. "You think we don't have what we need? We do. You just\
  \ don't see it yet."
RESOURCE_SCROUNGER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen too many people die waiting for a solution\
  \ instead of making one. He refuses to be one of them. If something needs fixing, if a problem\
  \ needs solving, he will find a way, no matter what it takes. "We can wait for a miracle, or we\
  \ can make one. Your call."

TRASH_TALKER.label=Relentless Trash Talker
TRASH_TALKER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he talks through the entire damn\
  \ thing. Whether he's mocking an enemy's aim, critiquing their strategy, or giving sarcastic\
  \ play-by-plays, he never lets up. "Oh wow, you actually hit something! Shame it wasn't me, but\
  \ hey, small victories, right?"
TRASH_TALKER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just insult - he targets weaknesses, exploits\
  \ frustration, and makes sure the enemy is too pissed off to think straight. "Oh no, don't take\
  \ your time! It's not like I've dodged this same move six times already."
TRASH_TALKER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry knows every fight could be his last, but if he's going\
  \ out, he's making sure his enemies hate him to the bitter end. He mocks to stay sane, to keep\
  \ the fear out, to make sure he never starts thinking too hard about how easily he could die.\
  \ "Hey, if you kill me, at least you'll finally have something to brag about."
TRASH_TALKER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry never lets a moment pass without some kind of remark,\
  \ whether it's teasing, sarcasm, or brutal honesty disguised as humor. "Oh, fantastic job\
  \ screwing that up in record time. Really, I'm impressed."
TRASH_TALKER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's trash talk isn't cruel - it's just how he interacts. If\
  \ he's not making fun of you, it's probably a bad sign. "Oh, you actually got it right this time?\
  \ Guess miracles do happen."
TRASH_TALKER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't trash talk just for fun - he does it because if he\
  \ doesn't keep things light, everything gets too heavy. He keeps the mocking, the teasing, the\
  \ insults flowing, because it's easier than thinking about how little room there is for laughter\
  \ in war. "Oh, we're probably doomed, but at least I'll get to make fun of you until we're all\
  \ dead."

CORRECTS_PRONOUNS.label=Quick to Correct Pronouns
CORRECTS_PRONOUNS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't let bullets, explosions, or chaos stop him from\
  \ making sure people get pronouns right. He'll dodge incoming fire while effortlessly correcting\
  \ someone mid-sentence. "Yeah, yeah, cover me - also, 'they' just took down two enemies, not 'she.'\
  \ Now move."
CORRECTS_PRONOUNS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry treats pronouns like any other battlefield precision - you\
  \ don't mess them up. He'll make a correction without missing a beat, right alongside calling out\
  \ enemy positions or tactical shifts. "Enemy at your nine o'clock, fallback route is clear, and\
  \ you misgendered them again - fix it."
CORRECTS_PRONOUNS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen people lose everything - homes, families, futures.\
  \ But names, pronouns, identity itself? That's one thing war shouldn't erase. So he doesn't let\
  \ it slide. Ever. "You respect who they are, or you don't deserve to fight alongside them."
CORRECTS_PRONOUNS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't make a big deal about it - he just corrects people's\
  \ pronouns instantly and moves on. It's as natural to him as breathing. "Yeah, she's handling\
  \ that - no, wait, they are. Anyway, back to what I was saying."
CORRECTS_PRONOUNS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry hears everything, and if a pronoun is wrong, he corrects\
  \ it. Doesn't matter if it's in passing or during a high-stakes discussion - he's fixing it\
  \ immediately. "Not 'her,' they. Keep going."
CORRECTS_PRONOUNS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has watched countless people reduced to statistics, ranks,\
  \ and numbers. He refuses to let identity become just another casualty. He will always correct\
  \ someone's pronouns with a quick, "if we lose who we are, then what the hell are we even\
  \ fighting for?"

BODY_DISCOMFORT.label=Uncomfortable in Their Own Body
BODY_DISCOMFORT.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry fights hard, fast, aggressive - but it never feels natural.\
  \ There's a hesitation in his movements, a disconnect between body and instinct, like he's\
  \ piloting himself instead of simply existing. "I move because standing still feels worse."
BODY_DISCOMFORT.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry runs himself ragged - pushing his body to the limit, past\
  \ the pain, past exhaustion. It's not just discipline - it's a way to feel something other than\
  \ this quiet, crawling wrongness. "If I stop moving, I start thinking. And I don't like where\
  \ that leads."
BODY_DISCOMFORT.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry wears the uniform, the gear, the weight of the war - but\
  \ none of it ever feels real. He moves like he's trapped in armor that isn't his own, unsure if\
  \ the person he once was is even still underneath it all. "I don't know if this body was ever\
  \ mine. I just know it's the only one I've got to keep surviving in."
BODY_DISCOMFORT.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry never sits still. He shifts his stance, tugs at sleeves,\
  \ readjusts posture - always moving, always slightly off-balance, like nothing ever feels fully\
  \ settled. "I'm fine. Just... this shirt's wrong. Or maybe it's just me."
BODY_DISCOMFORT.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry avoids catching his own reflection, doesn't linger when\
  \ changing, keeps his focus on anything but himself. If he talks about his body, it's with\
  \ detachment, like it's just another object he happens to be stuck with. "It's just a body. It\
  \ works. That's all that matters."
BODY_DISCOMFORT.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry wonders if the person he was supposed to be got lost\
  \ somewhere before the war, before all of this. If the body he has is his, or just something the\
  \ world forced him into. "I don't know if I hate this body, or if I just hate the way it never\
  \ really felt like mine."

MEK_COMFORT.label=Uncomfortable Off-Duty
MEK_COMFORT.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry feels restless the second he's not in combat. Sitting\
  \ still, relaxing - it just doesn't feel right. He moves like he's waiting for something to go\
  \ wrong, even when everything's fine. "Off-duty? What does that even mean? Feels like a damn\
  \ trap."
MEK_COMFORT.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust peace, silence, or downtime. His mind stays\
  \ wired for battle, scanning for threats that aren't there, anticipating the next crisis before\
  \ it happens. "This isn't normal. Something's coming. It always does."
MEK_COMFORT.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has been at war for too long. The fight is the only thing\
  \ that makes sense - without it, he feels empty, lost, disconnected. He moves through off-duty life\
  \ like a ghost, just waiting to be pulled back into the only thing that feels real. "Out there, I\
  \ know who I am. Here? I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to do."
MEK_COMFORT.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't sit back and enjoy downtime - he finds something to\
  \ do, even when it's unnecessary. If there's nothing urgent, he makes up reasons to stay\
  \ occupied. "Rest? No, I'm good. I'll... I'll find something to work on."
MEK_COMFORT.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry hates long stretches of nothing. He needs movement,\
  \ action, some kind of task. When forced to relax, he becomes short-tempered, distracted, always\
  \ glancing toward the door like he's waiting to be called back in. "How do people do this? Just...\
  \ sit here? For hours?"
MEK_COMFORT.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen too many quiet moments shattered by disaster.\
  \ He's lived through peace turning into chaos in an instant. So he never fully relaxes, never\
  \ lets his guard down, because he knows what happens when you do. "The second you start thinking\
  \ you're safe, that's when it happens. That's when you lose everything."

FEAR_OF_FIRE.label=Fear of Fire
FEAR_OF_FIRE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fear fire - he hates it. Flamethrowers,\
  \ explosions, even the glow of overheating systems make his breath catch in his throat. He fights\
  \ like he's always one step ahead of an inferno only he can see. "No. No fire. I don't care how\
  \ controlled it is - I said no."
FEAR_OF_FIRE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't play with fire. He'll take detours, avoid cover\
  \ that looks too flammable, refuse to engage near heat sources. It's not paranoia - it's survival.\
  \ "You want to fight in that sector? Surrounded by fuel tanks? Yeah. No. Find another route."
FEAR_OF_FIRE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fear fire - he's watched it consume people.\
  \ He's heard the screams, smelled the smoke, seen what's left after an inferno. And he knows that\
  \ if he ever ends up in that situation, there won't be anything left to save. "I'd take a bullet\
  \ over fire. A hundred times over. At least a bullet leaves something behind."
FEAR_OF_FIRE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry hates fire, hates the smell of burning, hates the way it\
  \ moves. Even small, harmless flames make his hands tighten, his pulse quicken. He doesn't say\
  \ anything, but he never takes his eyes off them until they're out. "No, I'm fine. Just - could you\
  \ put that out already?"
FEAR_OF_FIRE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry won't admit he's afraid, but he'll always have a reason to\
  \ leave a room where something's burning, to avoid places that smell like smoke, to never stand\
  \ too close to heat sources. "You all enjoy the bonfire. I'll be over here. Far away from it."
FEAR_OF_FIRE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen people burn. He's heard their screams, watched\
  \ them writhe, smelled what's left after the flames finally die out. And every time he does, he\
  \ swears it won't be him. "If fire ever comes for me, I won't give it the chance. I'll make sure\
  \ I go before it gets me."

TOUCH_SENSITIVE.label=Touch Sensitive
TOUCH_SENSITIVE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry hates being touched unexpectedly. A hand on his shoulder?\
  \ Instant tension. A brush against his arm? Barely-contained instinct to pull away. He moves like\
  \ someone who's always bracing for an impact that hasn't come yet. "Don't - just don't touch me\
  \ without warning."
TOUCH_SENSITIVE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry fights best when there's space between him and his\
  \ enemies. He doesn't like being grabbed, held, or pressed into close-range combat - it makes his\
  \ skin crawl. "I don't do grappling. If they get that close, I make sure they don't stay there."
TOUCH_SENSITIVE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't flinch because he's nervous - he flinches because\
  \ too many times, a hand on his arm was followed by a knife, a grip on his shoulder by a strike.\
  \ He's learned that even friendly touches can turn deadly in an instant. "Every time someone's\
  \ grabbed me without warning, something bad followed. You expect me to just forget that?"
TOUCH_SENSITIVE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry isn't obvious about it, but any time someone accidentally\
  \ brushes against him, claps him on the back, or leans in too close, his body reacts before he\
  \ does. "Nothing's wrong. Just - don't do that again."
TOUCH_SENSITIVE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry is constantly adjusting, subtly shifting away from people\
  \ without making a scene. It's not hostile - it's just instinct. He moves like someone who never\
  \ quite feels comfortable in physical space with others. "It's not you. I just... prefer some\
  \ space."
TOUCH_SENSITIVE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't hate touch - he just can't handle it. It makes\
  \ everything feel too real, too immediate, too much. The war, the weight of existence, the\
  \ feeling of being trapped in a body he never fully accepted. "Just - don't touch me. I don't need\
  \ a reason."

HOLOVID_FANATIC.label=Holovid Fanatic
HOLOVID_FANATIC.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry has a line from a holovid for every situation. Even in\
  \ the middle of combat, he's dropping one-liners, reenacting dramatic moments, and making sure\
  \ everyone knows exactly which classic scene they're living through. "You ever see Steel Storm\
  \ VI? Yeah? Then you know what happens next."
HOLOVID_FANATIC.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry fully believes in the coolest, most dramatic ways to\
  \ fight. If there's a stylish, over-the-top holovid maneuver that probably shouldn't work, he's\
  \ trying it anyway. "Okay, hear me out - if I time this just right, it'll look incredible."
HOLOVID_FANATIC.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry knows real war isn't like the holovids, but if he lets\
  \ himself think about that too much, the weight of reality will crush him. So he plays the part,\
  \ delivers the lines, and pretends the good guys always win. "Tell me this isn't exactly like\
  \ that scene from Blood Horizon. Just let me have this."
HOLOVID_FANATIC.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just watch holovids - he lives and breathes them.\
  \ Every conversation is sprinkled with deep-cut references that absolutely no one understands.\
  \ "Oh, this is exactly like Nightfall Over Terra-7. Wait, you haven't seen it? What do you do\
  \ with your life?"
HOLOVID_FANATIC.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has a holovid moment for everything. If something happens,\
  \ he's already comparing it to a classic scene, no matter how ridiculous the connection is.\
  \ "This? This is straight out of The Curse of Atlas. Trust me, we're about to hit the third-act\
  \ twist."
HOLOVID_FANATIC.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry knows holovids are escapism, but he doesn't care. They're\
  \ structured, predictable, full of meaning. Unlike the mess that is real life, where nothing\
  \ follows a script and everything falls apart for no reason. "Real life's got terrible pacing. At\
  \ least in holovids, things happen for a reason."

INVINCIBLE.label=Convinced They're Invincible
INVINCIBLE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just take risks - he welcomes them. He'll charge\
  \ headfirst into fire, take the most dangerous route, and act like he's physically incapable of\
  \ dying. "Oh, relax. I've survived worse than this. Probably."
INVINCIBLE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't see narrow escapes as luck - he sees them as\
  \ confirmation. Every bullet that whizzes past, every enemy that fails to land a hit just fuels\
  \ his belief that he's untouchable. "You see that? Didn't even graze me. Like I said, they can't\
  \ hit me."
INVINCIBLE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't let himself believe in his own mortality, because\
  \ if he does, the weight of everything he's survived, everything he's lost might crush him. It's\
  \ not arrogance - it's desperation. "I can't die. Not yet. Not like they did."
INVINCIBLE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't hesitate before doing something reckless, whether\
  \ it's lifting something way too heavy, skipping proper procedures, or ignoring obvious hazards.\
  \ He acts like the rules don't apply to him. "Oh, come on. What's the worst that could happen?\
  \ Never happened to me before."
INVINCIBLE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has walked away from disasters unscathed so many times that\
  \ he's convinced it's not luck - it's just how things work for him. He treats every near-miss as\
  \ proof of his invulnerability, yelling out "I am invincible" at the slightest provocation.
INVINCIBLE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry isn't stupid. He knows people die - he's seen it happen too\
  \ many times. But if he ever lets himself think it could happen to him, if he ever lets fear\
  \ creep in, he knows it'll slow him down, make him hesitate. And hesitation gets you killed.\
  \ "You think I'm reckless? No. I just refuse to believe I'm next."

STUTTERS.label=Stutters
STUTTERS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's voice may stumble, but his hands never shake. He might\
  \ struggle to get the words out, but when the moment comes to act, he's quicker and sharper than\
  \ anyone else. "L-l-listen, I d-don't need to s-say it twice. Y-you better move n-now."
STUTTERS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry hides behind jokes, dry remarks, and an attitude, but\
  \ when the adrenaline spikes, the stutter follows. He plays it off, but everyone knows he's\
  \ trying to bury it under bravado. "Oh, y-you think you're g-g-good? G-give me a sec, lemme just\
  \ d-d-dodge that like it's n-n-nothing."
STUTTERS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry wasn't always like this. Maybe it was the stress, the\
  \ years of battle, the losses piling up. Whatever the cause, his mouth can't always keep up with\
  \ his brain anymore. "It's j-j-just a voice, r-right? As long as I c-can still f-f-fight, it\
  \ d-doesn't matter."
STUTTERS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's mind is fast, but sometimes his words aren't. He knows\
  \ the answer, knows what needs to be done, but getting it out in real time takes effort. "I-it's\
  \ n-not that c-c-complicated. J-just f-follow the d-d-damn instructions."
STUTTERS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't mind people noticing - he minds when they pretend not\
  \ to hear it. He waves it off, but every once in a while, you can see the frustration flicker\
  \ through. "Yeah, yeah, I g-g-get it, I t-trip over my words. B-but you know w-w-what? I still\
  \ get sh-sh-**** done."
STUTTERS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's body keeps going, but his mind is fractured in ways he'll\
  \ never fully fix. The stutter is just a symptom, a telltale sign that something in him is still\
  \ processing all the things he'll never talk about. "J-j-just let me w-w-work. D-d-doesn't matter\
  \ how I say it, as long as I g-g-get it d-d-done."

ACROPHOBIA.label=Afraid of Heights
ACROPHOBIA.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't hesitate in a fight, doesn't flinch at\
  \ explosions, doesn't fear charging into danger. But the second he's too high off the ground,\
  \ that confidence vanishes. "No. I don't need a 'better vantage point.' I need to be on the\
  \ ground where I belong."
ACROPHOBIA.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry is known for being fearless - until a situation involves\
  \ height. He avoids cliffs, refuses to stand near edges, and takes every alternate route\
  \ possible. "Yeah, yeah, I know it's the 'quickest way.' It's also a death sentence. Find another\
  \ path."
ACROPHOBIA.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has watched people go over the edge. He's seen what's\
  \ left when they hit the ground. He remembers the silence right before impact. His fear isn't\
  \ irrational - it's experience. "You ever hear the sound someone makes when they realize there's no\
  \ way back? I have. That's why I'm staying right here."
ACROPHOBIA.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry will find another way, no matter how impractical. Ladders,\
  \ scaffolding, high walkways - he'll go twice the distance if it means staying close to the ground.\
  \ "Nah, not my problem. Someone else can deal with it. Preferably someone who doesn't value their\
  \ life."
ACROPHOBIA.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry plays it cool, but if you watch closely, he never gets too\
  \ close to anything with a sheer drop. He keeps his distance, avoids looking down, and never\
  \ volunteers for anything involving heights. "Nope. Not happening. You want me to do what? Yeah,\
  \ I don't think so."
ACROPHOBIA.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just fear falling - he fears what happens after. The\
  \ helplessness, the seconds of knowing there's nothing you can do, the certainty that the ground\
  \ is waiting for you. He's seen it too many times to ever risk it himself. "People think fear of\
  \ heights is about the fall. It's not. It's about the moment before - the one where you know\
  \ there's nothing left to save you."

CLAUSTROPHOBIA.label=Fear of Enclosed Spaces
CLAUSTROPHOBIA.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry thrives in open terrain, where he can move, reposition,\
  \ and breathe. But when he's forced into tight corridors, narrow tunnels, or cramped interiors,\
  \ his nerves start to fray. "I don't care if it's 'good cover' - it's a deathtrap. I need space to\
  \ move."
CLAUSTROPHOBIA.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry will take the long way if it means avoiding enclosed\
  \ areas. He doesn't do tunnels, small vehicles (not anymore), or tight formations. If there's\
  \ only one exit, he's already looking for another option. "One way in, one way out? Yeah, not\
  \ happening. That's how people die."
CLAUSTROPHOBIA.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has been stuck, buried, locked in, and he swore he'd\
  \ never let it happen again. He's seen what happens when people can't get out, heard the last\
  \ panicked breaths of those who never made it. "You don't understand. It's not the space. It's\
  \ the feeling of knowing there's no way out."
CLAUSTROPHOBIA.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry never outright says he has a problem, but he's always\
  \ positioning himself near exits, keeping space between himself and others, and avoiding rooms\
  \ that feel too small. "I'll stand. Don't need to sit. Yeah, the corner's fine. More space."
CLAUSTROPHOBIA.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't panic, but his discomfort is obvious if you know\
  \ what to look for. His breathing changes, his posture stiffens, and his eyes keep darting to the\
  \ door. "I'm fine. Just - this place is way too small. Not a fan."
CLAUSTROPHOBIA.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry knows what it's like to be helpless in a confined space,\
  \ unable to move, waiting for something to end him. He can still hear the echoes of those who\
  \ didn't make it out. "I don't do tight spaces. Ever. Because I know exactly how it ends."

AGORAPHOBIA.label=Fear of Open Spaces
AGORAPHOBIA.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry hates wide-open battlefields. He feels exposed,\
  \ vulnerable, and too easy to target. If there's no cover, if there's too much empty space around\
  \ him, his instincts start screaming. "You want me to stand out in the open? What, you trying to\
  \ get me killed?"
AGORAPHOBIA.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry isn't afraid to fight, but he feels better when there's a\
  \ ceiling over his head, solid walls around him, and nowhere for enemies to flank him. Wide, open\
  \ battlefields? He'll take his chances elsewhere. "I don't trust empty space. Too many angles,\
  \ too many places to get hit from."
AGORAPHOBIA.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen what happens when people stand out in the open.\
  \ He's watched them get picked off from unseen angles, witnessed how quickly an exposed position\
  \ turns into a death sentence. Now? He stays where he can control his surroundings. "Out there,\
  \ you're nothing but a target. Here? Here, at least you have a chance."
AGORAPHOBIA.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry is always near a wall, close to an exit, never lingering in\
  \ open spaces for too long. He doesn't like crowds, doesn't like too much space between him and\
  \ the nearest solid structure. "I'll stand over here. Feels better this way."
AGORAPHOBIA.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't panic, but he's noticeably uneasy in large, open\
  \ spaces. He sticks to shadows, corners, anywhere that makes the world feel smaller. "I'd rather\
  \ not stand in the middle of this room. You never know who's watching."
AGORAPHOBIA.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry hates open spaces because he knows exactly how fast things\
  \ can go wrong when there's no cover, no safety, nowhere to hide. He avoids crowds because\
  \ they're unpredictable, uncontrollable, and just as dangerous in their own way. "Too many eyes,\
  \ too many exits, too many places to die without seeing it coming."

NYCTOPHOBIA.label=Fear of the Dark
NYCTOPHOBIA.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry fights without hesitation, moves without fear, but in\
  \ total darkness, his hands tighten, his breathing changes. He won't admit it outright, but the\
  \ blackness unnerves him. "I don't need night vision - I need a damn light."
NYCTOPHOBIA.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't freeze in the dark - he moves, acts, does anything\
  \ but stand there and let the blackness settle around him. The quiet, the emptiness, the feeling\
  \ of not knowing what's lurking? Unacceptable. "I'll take an open firefight over this any day. At\
  \ least bullets don't sneak up on you from nowhere."
NYCTOPHOBIA.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry knows better than most that bad things happen in the\
  \ dark. He's heard the screams of people who wandered too far into it, seen the bodies of those\
  \ who didn't make it out. He doesn't fear the dark itself - he fears what always waits inside it.\
  \ "The dark doesn't kill you. It just hides the thing that will."
NYCTOPHOBIA.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't trust dimly lit rooms. If a bulb flickers, he\
  \ notices immediately. If he's in a dark space for too long, he starts looking for any excuse to\
  \ bring in more light. "No, I don't think it's 'cozy' - I think it's a goddamn liability."
NYCTOPHOBIA.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry isn't dramatic about it, but he won't walk into a\
  \ pitch-black space. If someone turns off the lights too soon, he's already reaching for a\
  \ flashlight. "I don't do pitch black. Shadows? Fine. But I want to see what's around me."
NYCTOPHOBIA.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has heard too many stories, seen too many things disappear\
  \ into the black and never return. He doesn't fear the dark because it's empty - he fears it\
  \ because he knows it never really is. "You don't hear them scream. One second they're there.\
  \ Then... nothing. That's why I don't go in blind."

MONOPHOBIA.label=Fear of Being Alone
MONOPHOBIA.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry can handle gunfire, explosions, and chaos, but the second\
  \ he's alone, the tension starts building. He checks his comms too often, moves faster than\
  \ necessary, like he's trying to escape the silence itself. "You still there? Just - check in every\
  \ few minutes, alright?"
MONOPHOBIA.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't do silent battlefields, abandoned locations, or\
  \ lone assignments. If he's the only one left in an area, he's on edge, restless, moving just to\
  \ break the quiet. "I don't like this. Too quiet. Way too quiet."
MONOPHOBIA.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen teammates disappear, heard allies fall silent,\
  \ felt the weight of being the last one alive. He doesn't fear isolation itself - he fears what it\
  \ means. "The second you're alone? That's when you know it's over."
MONOPHOBIA.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't announce his discomfort, but he's always where\
  \ people are. He lingers just a little longer in group settings, always finds a reason to stay\
  \ around someone. "Nah, I'm not leaving yet. Just... finishing something up."
MONOPHOBIA.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't handle silence well. He fills it with casual\
  \ conversation, jokes, even pointless observations - anything to keep the emptiness from creeping\
  \ in. "Yeah, I know I talk a lot. You'd rather sit in silence?"
MONOPHOBIA.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry isn't afraid of solitude. He's afraid of what happens to him\
  \ in solitude. The thoughts that come back, the ghosts that settle in, the weight of everything\
  \ he's lost pressing down on him all at once. "You think being alone just means no one's\
  \ around? No. It means there's no one left."

HEMOPHOBIA.label=Fear of Blood
HEMOPHOBIA.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry fights without hesitation, pushes through gunfire and\
  \ explosions, but the moment he sees blood - his or anyone else's - his focus fractures. His\
  \ breathing changes, his grip tightens, and he forces himself to look anywhere else. "I'm fine. I\
  \ just - don't ask me to look at it."
HEMOPHOBIA.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't acknowledge injuries. If someone's hit, if\
  \ something's bleeding, he focuses on everything else - the fight, the strategy, anything but the\
  \ mess pooling beneath them. "We'll deal with it after. Just - just don't describe it to me."
HEMOPHOBIA.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen blood spill in ways no one should, has watched it\
  \ drain from bodies, watched people cough it up, watched it soak into the ground like a stain\
  \ that never washes away. He's lost too many people, and now the sight of it makes his stomach\
  \ twist. "It's not fear. It's knowing exactly what happens next."
HEMOPHOBIA.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry winces when someone gets a paper cut, turns away if there's\
  \ even a hint of red. He refuses to handle anything that involves blood and will find any excuse\
  \ to leave the room. "Nope. Not doing that. Someone else handle it."
HEMOPHOBIA.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry pretends he's fine, but the moment someone starts bleeding,\
  \ even slightly, his reaction is immediate. His expression tightens, his hands clench, and he\
  \ very quickly finds an excuse to be somewhere else. "Yeah, I'm good. Just - uh, I'll be back in a\
  \ minute."
HEMOPHOBIA.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just fear blood - he knows what it means. He's seen\
  \ people lose too much, watched them weaken, slow down, go pale. Blood isn't just a mess - it's a\
  \ countdown. "Blood means something went wrong. And when there's enough of it, you already know\
  \ how the story ends."

ZERO_G_PARALYSIS.label=Fear of Zero-G
ZERO_G_PARALYSIS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry thrives in any environment where he can feel the\
  \ weight of his own body. But the second he's in zero gravity, he freezes. His instincts fail\
  \ him, his movements feel wrong, and the lack of control sets his nerves on fire. "This - this\
  \ isn't right. I can't - I need something solid beneath me."
ZERO_G_PARALYSIS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry hates floating. It's not natural, not right, and\
  \ every attempt to move feels like he's fighting against something invisible. He won't admit it,\
  \ but the moment he's in zero-G, he becomes a liability instead of a fighter. "I'm not scared. I\
  \ just - don't ask me to do anything useful up here."
ZERO_G_PARALYSIS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has been in zero-G before, and he hated every second\
  \ of it. No control, no weight, no sense of where danger could come from. He's seen people drift\
  \ away, unable to stop themselves, watched them disappear into the black, helpless. "You lose\
  \ control up here? You don't get it back. You just keep floating until something kills you or you\
  \ run out of air."
ZERO_G_PARALYSIS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry actively avoids any situation that might require zero\
  \ gravity. If there's a job that needs to be done weightless, he's already volunteering someone\
  \ else. "I'll take the next shift. On the ground. Where things stay where they're supposed to be."
ZERO_G_PARALYSIS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry tries to act normal, but in zero-G, he can't hide his\
  \ discomfort. He moves too carefully, too rigidly, his body tense with every motion. "Yeah, I'm\
  \ fine. Just - I'm gonna stay right here until we're back to normal."
ZERO_G_PARALYSIS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just dislike zero gravity - he fears it because\
  \ he's seen what happens to people who lose control in it. He's watched people flail, drift,\
  \ panic, and die without being able to do a thing about it. "On the ground, you fall. In zero-G,\
  \ you just keep going. And no one's saving you if you go too far."

HEDONIST.label=Hedonist
HEDONIST.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't fight for honor, duty, or ideology - he fights because\
  \ it makes him feel alive. Every battle is a rush, a sensation, a fleeting moment of pure\
  \ adrenaline that nothing else can match. "You hear that? That's the sound of life happening. And\
  \ I intend to enjoy every second of it."
HEDONIST.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry never lets a win pass without making the most of it. He\
  \ lives fast, hard, and without restraint, because in his mind, there's no point in holding back.\
  \ "We survived today? Then we drink, we feast, and we take what we can. Because tomorrow?\
  \ Tomorrow is a gamble."
HEDONIST.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has stopped believing in long-term plans, in saving up, in\
  \ waiting for better days. He's seen too many people die with regrets, too many final moments\
  \ filled with 'what ifs'. He refuses to be one of them. "I don't care what comes next. Right now,\
  \ I'm alive. And that means I take everything life has to offer."
HEDONIST.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry isn't one to deny himself pleasure, no matter how bleak things\
  \ get. If there's good food, good drink, or something enjoyable to be had, he's already\
  \ indulging. "Oh, you're telling me I shouldn't enjoy myself? That sounds like a you problem.
HEDONIST.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in waiting for a 'better time'. He finds\
  \ pleasure wherever he can, whenever he can, and drags others into the fun - sometimes against\
  \ their better judgment. "You're really gonna sit there and be miserable when you could be having\
  \ a damn good time? Come on."
HEDONIST.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just like pleasure - he demands it, because he's seen\
  \ what happens to people who keep putting it off. He knows tomorrow isn't promised, so he takes\
  \ everything while he still can. "You think we have time to waste? That we'll all just live long\
  \ enough for a 'right moment'? No. We take what we can, while we still can."

BROADCASTS_MUSIC.label=Broadcasts Music
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he sets the mood. His comms are\
  \ always playing something, whether it's dramatic orchestral scores, pounding war drums, or\
  \ completely inappropriate upbeat tunes. "If we're going into hell, we might as well have a\
  \ killer playlist."
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry keeps his squad energized and his enemies confused\
  \ by ensuring every engagement comes with a backing track. One moment it's hard-hitting metal,\
  \ the next it's a slow, eerie hum that unsettles everyone. "Oh, you don't like my music? Guess\
  \ you better finish the fight fast then."
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry keeps the music going because without it, all that's\
  \ left is the sound of gunfire, screams, and things he'd rather not remember. He drowns it all\
  \ out before it can creep in. "You want me to turn it off? No. I don't do silence."
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's workspace is never quiet. Whether it's a steady\
  \ beat, a slow melody, or something completely chaotic, there's always some kind of sound filling\
  \ the air. "I work better with music. And you? You'll get used to it."
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't ask permission - he just starts playing whatever\
  \ music he wants, expecting everyone else to deal with it. If someone complains? He turns it up\
  \ just a little louder. "You'd rather sit in silence? That's the real crime here."
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry knows that if he ever lets things go silent, the\
  \ memories will start creeping back in. The people who aren't here anymore, the things he should\
  \ have done differently. So the music stays on - always. "The second the music stops, that's when\
  \ it gets bad. And I don't plan on letting it stop."

NEMESIS.label=Has a Nemesis
NEMESIS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he fights with purpose. There's always one\
  \ name, one face, one opponent that he's constantly measuring himself against. Every battle is\
  \ just another step toward proving, once and for all, who's better. "Tell me they're here. Tell\
  \ me they showed up. I want this fight to matter."
NEMESIS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry has an personal enemy and he remembers every fight, every\
  \ close call, every trick his nemesis has ever pulled. He replays past encounters in his head,\
  \ looking for patterns, weaknesses, an edge. "Last time, they hesitated when pressured. This\
  \ time? I won't give them the chance."
NEMESIS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry knows that most fights don't matter, that most enemies are\
  \ just faceless obstacles. But there's one. One that is different. One that is personal. This\
  \ rivalry is the only thing left that still feels like it has meaning. "They'll either kill me,\
  \ or I'll kill them. And that's the only thing I know for sure anymore."
NEMESIS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry has one person who, for whatever reason, has become his eternal\
  \ competition. It might be serious, ridiculous, or entirely one-sided, but he refuses to back\
  \ down. "Oh, they did it first? Great. Now I have to do it better."
NEMESIS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry turns everything into a direct challenge between himself and\
  \ his nemesis. It could be work efficiency, problem-solving, or even something as simple as\
  \ making coffee - he must come out on top. "If they did it in five minutes, I'll do it in four.\
  \ Watch me."
NEMESIS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just have a rival - he has a fixation. A constant\
  \ presence in his life that keeps him pushing forward, staying sharp, refusing to slip into\
  \ complacency. Without that challenge, he's not sure he'd know what to do with himself anymore.\
  \ "Without them, I don't know who I'd be. And that scares me more than losing."

FEAR_MECHS.label=Fear of Mechs
FEAR_MECHS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry hates being near mechs, not because they're ineffective,\
  \ but because they're too effective. Every time he sees one move, he remembers what they leave\
  \ behind - crushed buildings, burning wreckage, bodies no one ever digs out. "You don't pilot a\
  \ mech. You unleash one. And when it moves, something always gets left in ruins."
FEAR_MECHS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry won't touch a mech unless there's no other choice. He'd\
  \ rather fight on foot, in vehicles, anywhere that doesn't feel like piloting a walking war\
  \ crime. "You ever seen a mech step on a person? No? Then you don't understand why I don't trust\
  \ those things."
FEAR_MECHS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has watched entire towns vanish under mech fire. He's seen\
  \ soldiers pulped by autocannons meant for armored targets. And the worst part? Most pilots don't\
  \ seem to care, they just continue walking forward like nothing happened."
FEAR_MECHS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry never stands too close to a mech, never trusts that they're\
  \ fully powered down, never walks beneath one without his pulse spiking. They're too big, too\
  \ unnatural, too much like monsters pretending to be machines. "I don't care if it's offline.\
  \ That thing's one bad signal away from flattening this entire place."
FEAR_MECHS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't see engineering marvels, doesn't admire firepower or\
  \ armor plating. When he looks at a mech, all he sees are crushed buildings, burning streets,\
  \ people who never had a chance to run. "You ever watch a mech walk through a city? The pilot\
  \ thinks it's just debris. I've seen the bodies they pull out after."
FEAR_MECHS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just dislike mechs - he fears them, because he's been\
  \ there when they've turned entire streets into craters, reduced people to nothing but a red\
  \ mist. And he knows they're not done yet. "Mechs don't fight. They erase. And once they've\
  \ started, they don't stop until nothing's left."

LOCAL_CONNECTOR.label=Local Connector
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just see territory - he sees people. Whenever\
  \ he's deployed, he learns the culture, the customs, the stories of those who live there. He\
  \ doesn't believe in fighting blindly. "You want to survive out here? Then talk to the ones who\
  \ actually live here - they've been surviving longer than we have."
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry isn't just here to fight - he's here to understand. He\
  \ talks to locals, listens to their concerns, finds ways to work with them instead of trampling\
  \ over them. He knows that alliances built through respect last longer than those built through\
  \ fear. "You think we can just roll in, do our job, and leave? That's why so many before us failed."
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust command, strategy reports, or maps\
  \ drawn by people who have never stepped foot here. He trusts locals. He knows that understanding\
  \ them is the difference between life and death. "You ignore them, you die. It's that simple. And\
  \ when you do, they won't mourn you. They'll say you deserved it."
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't treat new places like temporary stops. He\
  \ learns the culture, the etiquette, the things outsiders usually ignore. If he's going to be\
  \ somewhere new, he's going to do it right. "If you don't bother to learn how people live, don't\
  \ be surprised when they don't want you here."
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry never stays just with his unit - he integrates into local\
  \ life. He'll be found talking with vendors, learning regional slang, and making himself at home.\
  \ "You want to know what's really going on? Talk to the people who actually live here. Not the\
  \ ones just passing through."
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry isn't just curious - he's calculating. He knows that when\
  \ things go south, it won't be his team, his leadership, or his training that saves him. It'll\
  \ be whether or not the locals think he's worth saving. "One day, you're going to need a favor.\
  \ And if you didn't bother to earn their trust first, you're not getting one."

HATRED.label=Hates the Enemy
HATRED.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight against the enemy - he fights because of\
  \ them. Every engagement is personal, every battle another chance to wipe them from existence.\
  \ "No mercy. No second chances. If they're standing, they're still a threat."
HATRED.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't see gray areas or moral debates. He sees right and\
  \ wrong, us and them. The enemy isn't just someone on the other side - they're a stain that needs\
  \ to be wiped out. "I don't want to hear about 'understanding them.' I want to hear that they're\
  \ dead."
HATRED.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't hate without reason. He's seen the ruins, the bodies,\
  \ the aftermath of what the enemy has done. He doesn't fight for glory - he fights for revenge.\
  \ "You don't 'negotiate' with butchers. You make sure they never get the chance to do it again."
HATRED.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry won't entertain conversations about why the enemy does what they\
  \ do. He won't listen to sympathy, won't engage with debate. To him, the only good conversation\
  \ about the enemy is one that ends with their destruction. "I don't care about their motives. I\
  \ care about making sure they don't walk away from this war."
HATRED.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just oppose the enemy - he despises them. Any attempt at\
  \ rationalizing, debating, or finding common ground sets him on edge. "You think they'd show you\
  \ the same sympathy? They wouldn't. So stop wasting your breath."
HATRED.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry carries the scars of what the enemy has done. He's lost too\
  \ much, seen too much, felt too much pain to ever let it go. His hate isn't blind - it's earned.\
  \ "If you knew what I knew, if you'd seen what I've seen, you'd hate them too. And you wouldn't\
  \ stop until they were gone."
