ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.label=Constantly Adjusting Clothes
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.0=Barry always makes sure he looks sharp. Whether it?s straightening\
  \ his collar, adjusting his cuffs, or dusting off his jacket, he takes pride in his appearance -\
  \ because presentation matters just as much as performance.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.1=Fidgeting with his clothes is more than just a habit?it?s a tell.\
  \ Barry constantly tugs at his sleeves, smooths his uniform, or readjusts his gear, as if trying\
  \ to maintain control in a world that never stops shifting around him.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.2=Barry barely notices how often he fixes his outfit. Whether it?s out\
  \ of habit or subconscious vanity, his hands are always adjusting something?his gloves, his belt,\
  \ his collar?as if perfection is just one more tweak away.

AFFECTIONATE.label=Overly Affectionate
AFFECTIONATE.description.0=Barry thrives on connection, always ready with a pat on the back, a firm\
  \ handshake, or an arm around a friend?s shoulder. His enthusiasm for others can be overwhelming,\
  \ but it?s hard to deny that his heart is in the right place.
AFFECTIONATE.description.1=Affection isn?t just a habit?it?s a survival mechanism. Barry clings to\
  \ those around him, seeking reassurance through touch and constant reminders that he?s not alone.\
  \ In a world full of loss, he holds onto people like they might vanish at any moment.
AFFECTIONATE.description.2=Barry is always in someone?s personal space, throwing an arm around a\
  \ teammate or offering an exaggerated wink. Whether it?s genuine affection or just part of his\
  \ charismatic charm, he enjoys making others feel noticed?even if it sometimes borders on too much.

APOLOGETIC.label=Overly Apologetic
APOLOGETIC.description.0=Barry apologizes for everything, even when it?s not his fault. He hates\
  \ inconveniencing others and would rather take the blame than risk conflict, often saying ?sorry?\
  \ out of pure habit.
APOLOGETIC.description.1=Every mistake haunts him. Barry carries the weight of past failures,\
  \ constantly apologizing as if trying to atone for things he can never undo. Even when no one\
  \ else remembers, he never stops punishing himself.
APOLOGETIC.description.2=Barry just wants to keep the peace. He over-explains, backtracks, and\
  \ apologizes excessively, always worried that he?s offended someone or made the wrong call. His\
  \ tendency to second-guess himself can make him hesitant, but his heart is always in the right\
  \ place.

BOOKWORM.label=Always Reading
BOOKWORM.description.0=Barry is constantly buried in a book, a datapad, or mission reports. He\
  \ thrives on information, always looking to expand his understanding of tactics, history, or\
  \ anything else that might give him an edge.
BOOKWORM.description.1=Reading is his refuge. In a universe full of war and chaos, Barry disappears\
  \ into books to escape reality, losing himself in stories or data that provide a distraction from\
  \ the horrors around him.
BOOKWORM.description.2=A book in hand doesn?t mean Barry isn?t paying attention. He listens, takes\
  \ in everything around him, and processes information while he reads. Whether it?s research or\
  \ just habit, his love for reading never slows him down.

CALENDAR.label=Keeps a Personal Calendar
CALENDAR.description.0=Barry believes in structure and efficiency. His personal calendar is\
  \ meticulously maintained, with every mission, meeting, and training session scheduled down to\
  \ the minute. If it?s not written down, it doesn?t happen.
CALENDAR.description.1=In an unpredictable world, his calendar is one of the few things he can\
  \ control. Barry meticulously tracks every detail of his life, obsessing over schedules to\
  \ maintain order in the chaos. If things don?t go according to plan, it unsettles him more than\
  \ he?d admit.
CALENDAR.description.2=Barry?s calendar isn?t just about dates and appointments?it?s a record of\
  \ his life. He marks anniversaries, remembers small moments, and keeps notes about people and\
  \ places that matter to him. For him, it?s not just organization; it?s personal history.

CANDLES.label=Fond of Scented Candles
CANDLES.description.0=Barry uses scented candles to unwind after a long day. Whether it?s the smell\
  \ of fresh pine, vanilla, or something nostalgic, lighting a candle helps him carve out a little\
  \ moment of peace in an otherwise chaotic life.
CANDLES.description.1=The battlefield smells like blood, smoke, and burnt metal?so Barry surrounds\
  \ himself with anything but that. Scented candles are a small rebellion against the horrors of\
  \ war, a way to block out memories that threaten to creep in when things go quiet.
CANDLES.description.2=An absolute connoisseur of scented candles. Barry will go on for way too long\
  \ about which brands last the longest, which scents are underrated, and why cinnamon apple is\
  \ objectively superior. No one questions it anymore.

CHEWING_GUM.label=Always Chewing Gum
CHEWING_GUM.description.0=Chewing gum is just second nature to Barry. It keeps him focused, gives\
  \ him something to do when things are slow, and helps him stay cool under pressure?whether he?s\
  \ fighting on the line or waiting out a tense negotiation.
CHEWING_GUM.description.1=The gum keeps his mind occupied, a small ritual to distract from the\
  \ weight of everything else. Without it, he might start grinding his teeth or pacing?anything to\
  \ keep from thinking too much about what he?s seen and done.
CHEWING_GUM.description.2=There?s something about the way Barry chews gum that adds to his swagger.\
  \ He smirks through conversations, pops bubbles in the middle of tense moments, and somehow makes\
  \ it look effortless?like he?s always one step ahead of everyone else.

CHRONIC_LATENESS.label=Chronically Late
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.0=Barry never rushes. He operates on his own schedule, strolling in\
  \ late with a casual shrug and an excuse that?s equal parts amusing and infuriating. He doesn?t\
  \ mean to be disrespectful?he just doesn?t see what the hurry is.
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.1=There?s always too much to do and never enough time. Barry isn?t\
  \ late because he?s lazy?he?s late because he?s overworked, stretched too thin, and constantly\
  \ juggling a dozen responsibilities. He?s trying his best, but something always slips through the\
  \ cracks.
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.2=Barry treats punctuality like a suggestion rather than a rule. He\
  \ makes grand entrances, waltzing in with a grin and a half-hearted apology that somehow makes it\
  \ impossible to stay mad at him?no matter how much people want to.

CLEANER.label=Compulsive Cleaner
CLEANER.description.0=Barry believes a clean space means a clear mind. His gear is spotless, his\
  \ workspace meticulously organized, and he keeps everything in perfect order. A mess isn?t just\
  \ annoying?it?s disruptive.
CLEANER.description.1=In a world full of chaos, cleaning is the one thing Barry can control. Every\
  \ wiped surface, every polished piece of armor, every precisely stacked document is his way of\
  \ maintaining order when everything else feels like it?s falling apart.
CLEANER.description.2=Barry doesn?t even realize how often he cleans. He wipes down tables while\
  \ talking, adjusts things on shelves without thinking, and polishes his ?Mech?s console before\
  \ every mission. It?s not about cleanliness?it?s just something to keep his hands busy.

COLLECTOR.label=Collects Odd Items
COLLECTOR.description.0=Barry has an eye for the unusual. Whether it?s old coins, antique dog tags,\
  \ or random bits of ?Mech scrap with no clear purpose, he keeps things that speak to him. Each\
  \ item has a story?even if no one else understands why he cares.
COLLECTOR.description.1=Every strange object he collects is a reminder. A rusted emblem from a\
  \ fallen comrade, a broken sensor pulled from a battlefield, a dented shell casing that saved his\
  \ life?his collection isn?t just junk; it?s a record of everything he?s survived.
COLLECTOR.description.2=Barry?s odd collection is his pride and joy, and he loves talking about it.\
  \ He?ll go on about the rare rock he found on some backwater planet, the ancient ration pack he\
  \ refuses to open, or the piece of armor he swears belonged to a famous warrior. It may be weird,\
  \ but it?s his weird.

COMPETITIVE_NATURE.label=Competitive Nature
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.0=Barry loves a challenge. Whether it?s piloting, strategy, or even\
  \ something as simple as a bar bet, he can?t resist turning everything into a competition. He\
  \ pushes himself?and everyone around him?to always go for the win, but it?s all in good fun.
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.1=Losing isn?t an option. Barry treats every fight, every mission,\
  \ every rivalry as a battle for dominance. He doesn?t just want to win?he needs to. And if that\
  \ means bending the rules, outmaneuvering allies, or leaving scorched earth behind, so be it.
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.2=Barry is damn good at what he does, and he knows it. He thrives on\
  \ competition, always looking for someone to beat, something to prove, or a record to break. He?s\
  \ the type to throw down a challenge with a smirk?and back it up every time.

COMPLIMENTS.label=Excessive Complimenter
COMPLIMENTS.description.0=Barry believes in lifting people up?constantly. Whether it?s a teammate?s\
  \ piloting skills, a bartender?s drink-mixing talent, or a stranger?s choice of boots, he always\
  \ has a compliment ready. It?s genuine, if sometimes a bit much.
COMPLIMENTS.description.1=Flattery is a weapon, and Barry wields it well. Compliments aren?t just\
  \ kindness?they?re calculated. He praises people just enough to lower their guard, get what he\
  \ wants, or make sure they owe him later.
COMPLIMENTS.description.2=Barry throws out compliments like confetti?fast, frequent, and sometimes\
  \ completely random. ?That?s the best coffee I?ve ever had.? ?Your ?Mech looks fantastic in this\
  \ lighting.? ?You breathe so efficiently.? It?s impossible to tell if he?s serious, but it?s\
  \ never dull.

DAYDREAMER.label=Prone to Daydreaming
DAYDREAMER.description.0=Barry?s mind is always drifting, lost in ideas, strategies, or what-ifs.\
  \ Whether he?s staring out at the stars or absentmindedly doodling on a datapad, he?s constantly\
  \ envisioning possibilities beyond the present moment.
DAYDREAMER.description.1=Reality is harsh, and Barry finds himself slipping away from it whenever\
  \ he can. He retreats into dreams of a better life, reliving memories of what could have been,\
  \ anything to avoid facing the brutal truth of the world around him.
DAYDREAMER.description.2=Barry may seem absentminded, but when he snaps back to reality, his\
  \ insights can be shockingly sharp. His daydreaming isn?t just idle wandering?it?s where he\
  \ pieces together ideas, finds creative solutions, and occasionally stumbles onto brilliance.

DOODLER.label=Compulsive Doodler
DOODLER.description.0=Barry?s hands are always moving, sketching random shapes, ?Mech designs, or\
  \ battle maps in the margins of reports. It helps him focus?at least, that?s what he tells people\
  \ when they catch him drawing instead of listening.
DOODLER.description.1=Doodling is more than just a habit?it?s a way to keep the nightmares at bay.\
  \ Barry?s notes, datapads, and cockpit panels are covered in small, intricate sketches, a quiet\
  \ act of defiance against the war that refuses to leave his mind.
DOODLER.description.2=No meeting, briefing, or downtime is complete without Barry idly doodling\
  \ something absurd. Whether it?s caricatures of his squadmates, ridiculous battle plans, or a\
  \ crude sketch of an Atlas with a top hat, his little drawings make everything just a bit more\
  \ entertaining.

DOOLITTLE.label=Talks to Animals
DOOLITTLE.description.0=Barry treats animals like they?re just as important as people?maybe\
  \ even more so. He chats with them like old friends, gives them nicknames, and seems to believe\
  \ they understand every word. Maybe they do.
DOOLITTLE.description.1=Animals don?t betray, don?t judge, don?t die for pointless causes.\
  \ Barry talks to them because they?re the only ones who listen without expectation. In a world\
  \ filled with loss, they?re the only company he truly trusts.
DOOLITTLE.description.2=Whether it?s a stray cat, a JumpShip?s mascot, or a bird passing by,\
  \ Barry always has something to say. He debates strategy with pigeons, complains about the\
  \ weather to dogs, and thanks horses for their service. People find it weird?Barry doesn?t care.

DRAMATIC.label=Overly Dramatic
DRAMATIC.description.0=Barry never just tells a story?he performs it. Every gesture is exaggerated,\
  \ every retelling is full of flair, and every minor inconvenience is a world-ending catastrophe.\
  \ He thrives on making even the smallest moments big.
DRAMATIC.description.1=Everything in Barry?s life is painted in broad, sweeping strokes of\
  \ suffering and glory. He treats his struggles like an epic saga, carrying his burdens as if the\
  \ universe itself is watching. Whether it?s genuine or an act, he feels like the center of a\
  \ grand, doomed narrative.
DRAMATIC.description.2=Barry can?t just do things?he declares them. A long day is "the greatest\
  \ trial of my existence!" A minor injury is "a wound that may never heal!" It?s impossible to\
  \ tell if he?s serious or just having fun, but either way, he loves the attention.

EATING_HABITS.label=Unpredictable Eating Habits
EATING_HABITS.description.0=Barry eats whenever and whatever is available, with no rhyme or\
  \ reason. One day it?s three full meals, the next it?s nothing but protein bars and coffee. If he\
  \ remembers to eat at all, it?s usually in the middle of something else.
EATING_HABITS.description.1=Food is fuel, nothing more. Barry has no schedule, no preferences -\
  \ just whatever keeps him moving. Sometimes he forgets to eat for days, then suddenly gorges\
  \ himself like he?s making up for lost time. Years of hardship have made food an afterthought,\
  \ not a pleasure.
EATING_HABITS.description.2=Barry?s eating habits are an unpredictable mix of strange cravings,\
  \ weird food combinations, and completely random timing. One minute he?s eating cold rations with\
  \ hot sauce, the next he?s critiquing a fancy meal like a professional chef. No one understands\
  \ it?but Barry swears it makes perfect sense.

ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.label=Extreme Environmental Sensitivity
ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.description.0=Barry picks up on every little shift in temperature, air\
  \ quality, and pressure. If the room is even slightly too cold or the humidity changes by a\
  \ fraction, he?s the first to comment. It?s like his body is wired to notice things others\
  \ ignore.
ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.description.1=Years of stress, injury, or a compromised immune system\
  \ have left Barry hypersensitive to his surroundings. Too much heat drains him, too much cold\
  \ leaves him aching, and unfamiliar environments take a toll on his body faster than they should.\
  \ He pushes through it, but it?s a constant struggle.
ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.description.2=Barry reacts to environmental changes like they?re personal\
  \ attacks. "Why is it so humid? Am I drowning in the air?" "This sun is actively trying to kill\
  \ me." "If I step outside in this cold, I will die instantly." Whether exaggerated or real, he\
  \ never stops talking about it.

EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.label=Excessive Caution
EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.description.0=Barry double-checks everything?his gear, his surroundings, his\
  \ escape routes. Every move he makes is carefully planned, and he refuses to take unnecessary\
  \ risks. Some call him paranoid; he calls it staying alive.
EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.description.1=Every mistake, every close call, every loss has left a mark. Barry\
  \ hesitates, overanalyzes, and struggles to trust even his own instincts. He knows what happens\
  \ when people get reckless?and he refuses to be next.
EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.description.2=Barry takes caution to ridiculous extremes. He refuses to eat food\
  \ he didn?t watch being prepared, insists on walking three steps behind in case of ambushes, and\
  \ has a backup plan for his backup plan. His team finds it exhausting?but they?re still alive.

EXCESSIVE_GREETING.label=Over-the-Top Greetings
EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.0=Barry never enters a room quietly. Whether it?s a booming "My\
  \ favorite people!" or an exaggerated bow, he makes sure everyone knows he?s arrived. His\
  \ greetings are big, his handshakes firm, and his energy impossible to ignore.
EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.1=Every greeting is a performance, a way to keep people close and\
  \ avoid the silence that creeps in when he?s alone. The laughter, the bear hugs, the dramatic\
  \ entrances?it?s all a distraction from the weight he refuses to acknowledge.
EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.2=No one knows what to expect when Barry greets them. One day it?s a\
  \ salute, the next it?s an elaborate secret handshake, and sometimes it?s an exaggerated "Ah, my\
  \ long-lost sibling!" whether he?s met them before or not. It?s hard to tell if he?s joking?but\
  \ it?s never boring.

EYE_CONTACT.label=Maintains Intense Eye Contact
EYE_CONTACT.description.0=Barry?s gaze is unwavering, making every conversation feel like a\
  \ high-stakes negotiation. Whether he?s issuing orders or just making small talk, his intense eye\
  \ contact exudes authority and control, keeping people on their toes.
EYE_CONTACT.description.1=There?s something off about the way Barry locks eyes with people. He\
  \ doesn?t blink enough, doesn?t look away when most would, and seems to be studying whoever he?s\
  \ talking to?like he?s memorizing their weaknesses.
EYE_CONTACT.description.2=Barry makes eye contact a sport. He leans in, stares a little too long,\
  \ and refuses to break first, turning even casual conversations into weirdly intense moments.\
  \ Whether he?s doing it on purpose or just enjoys watching people squirm, no one really knows.

FASHION_CHOICES.label=Eccentric Fashion Choices
FASHION_CHOICES.description.0=Barry wears what he wants, practicality be damned. Whether it?s a\
  \ bright scarf in the middle of a war zone, a jacket with unnecessary but stylish embellishments,\
  \ or mismatched accessories, his outfits make a statement?and that statement is confidence.
FASHION_CHOICES.description.1=Every strange piece of clothing Barry wears has meaning. The\
  \ patched-up coat belonged to a fallen comrade, the mismatched gloves remind him of a lesson\
  \ learned, and the absurdly bright sash? A reminder that he refuses to let war strip him of\
  \ identity.
FASHION_CHOICES.description.2=No one knows what Barry will show up wearing next. A formal uniform\
  \ with ridiculous custom embroidery? A pilot suit and a cowboy hat? A perfectly normal outfit\
  \ ruined by just one bizarre fashion choice? It?s never the same twice, and it?s always a\
  \ conversation starter.

FIDGETS.label=Constantly Fidgeting
FIDGETS.description.0=Barry can?t sit still. He drums his fingers, taps his foot, spins a pen in\
  \ his hand?anything to keep moving. It?s not that he?s anxious; he just needs to be doing\
  \ something at all times, or he starts feeling trapped.
FIDGETS.description.1=Fidgeting isn?t just a habit?it?s a symptom. Barry constantly adjusts his\
  \ gear, rolls a coin between his fingers, or messes with a lighter, unable to fully relax. The\
  \ tension never leaves his body, and the moment he stops moving, the memories creep in.
FIDGETS.description.2=Barry?s fidgeting is everywhere. He flips a knife absentmindedly, bounces his\
  \ knee like he?s got an engine running, or starts dismantling and reassembling random objects\
  \ just to keep his hands busy. It?s entertaining?until someone loses a pen or finds their comm\
  \ unit mysteriously taken apart.

FITNESS.label=Extreme Personal Fitness Routine
FITNESS.description.0=Barry treats his body like a machine?one that must be kept in peak condition.\
  \ He starts every day with intense training, follows a strict diet, and pushes himself to his\
  \ physical limits, believing strength and endurance are just as vital as skill in battle.
FITNESS.description.1=Fitness isn?t just a routine?it?s survival. Barry pushes himself beyond\
  \ exhaustion, punishing his body with brutal workouts as if he?s trying to outrun something.\
  \ Maybe it?s fear, maybe it?s guilt, or maybe he just doesn?t know how to stop.
FITNESS.description.2=Barry doesn?t just work out?he preaches about it. He?s the guy doing push-ups\
  \ while waiting for orders, challenging teammates to ridiculous endurance contests, and loudly\
  \ proclaiming the benefits of "just one more set!" Whether it?s inspiring or exhausting depends\
  \ on who you ask.

FIXATES.label=Fixates on One Topic
FIXATES.description.0=Once Barry latches onto a subject, he won?t let go. Whether it?s a battle\
  \ strategy, a historical event, or a particular 'Mech model, he dives deep, learning every detail\
  \ and talking about it nonstop until everyone around him knows it too.
FIXATES.description.1=Fixation is his way of coping. Barry clings to a single topic?whether it?s an\
  \ old mission, a fallen comrade, or a tactical philosophy?replaying it endlessly in his mind, as\
  \ if understanding it fully might change something that can?t be undone.
FIXATES.description.2=Barry doesn?t just like things?he lives them. If he?s into something,\
  \ everyone will hear about it. He can spend hours explaining why one 'Mech loadout is superior,\
  \ why a specific historical battle fascinates him, or why this particular brand of coffee is\
  \ objectively the best in the galaxy.

FLASK.label=Carries a Flask
FLASK.description.0=Barry keeps a flask on him for just the right moment. A celebratory\
  \ drink, a stress reliever, or a quiet sip during downtime?he?s always got a little something to\
  \ take the edge off, but never enough to lose control.
FLASK.description.1=The flask isn?t just a habit?it?s a necessity. Barry drinks to dull\
  \ the memories, to silence the ghosts, to make the weight of war a little easier to bear. It?s\
  \ never enough to be obvious, but enough that he needs it more than he?d admit.
FLASK.description.2=Barry?s flask isn?t just for him?it?s for whoever?s around. He offers\
  \ a sip to friends, toasts to victories and defeats alike, and always seems to have just enough\
  \ to share. Whether it?s whiskey, spiced rum, or something questionable from a backwater planet,\
  \ he swears it makes every conversation better.

FOOT_TAPPER.label=Always Tapping Foot
FOOT_TAPPER.description.0=Barry is constantly moving, even when standing still. His foot taps a\
  \ steady rhythm, a subconscious need to keep himself in motion. It?s not impatience?it?s just how\
  \ he stays engaged, as if his body refuses to sit idle.
FOOT_TAPPER.description.1=The tapping isn?t just a habit?it?s a symptom. Whether it?s stress,\
  \ trauma, or something deeper, Barry?s foot is always moving, a physical outlet for the tension\
  \ he can?t shake. It?s the only thing keeping his hands from shaking, his mind from wandering\
  \ too far.
FOOT_TAPPER.description.2=There?s a rhythm to everything Barry does, and his foot-tapping is\
  \ just part of it. He?s always drumming out a beat, syncing to a tune in his head, or keeping\
  \ time without realizing it. It?s charming?until someone finally snaps and tells him to stop

FORGETFUL.label=Chronically Forgetful
FORGETFUL.description.0=Barry isn?t trying to forget things, but his mind is always racing\
  \ from one thought to the next. Dates, names, even where he left his gear?it all just slips\
  \ through the cracks. He means well, but don?t expect him to remember what you told him five\
  \ minutes ago.
FORGETFUL.description.1=There?s only so much a person can hold onto before something gives.\
  \ Barry?s mind is cluttered with battles, losses, and decisions that haunt him, leaving little\
  \ room for anything else. He forgets simple things?sometimes even important things?but deep down,\
  \ he knows it?s because his mind is drowning in everything he can?t forget.
FORGETFUL.description.2=Barry?s forgetfulness is almost legendary. He misplaces his keys,\
  \ forgets orders, and walks into a room with no idea why he?s there. It would be infuriating?if\
  \ he didn?t laugh it off so easily and somehow always manage to recover at the last second.

FORMAL_SPEECH.label=Overly Formal Speech
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.0=Barry speaks with precision, enunciating every word as if he?s\
  \ delivering a mission briefing?even in casual conversation. He avoids slang, prefers full\
  \ sentences, and treats every interaction like it deserves his utmost attention.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.1=Formality is a shield. Barry keeps his language stiff and measured,\
  \ refusing to let emotion slip into his words. He speaks like he's giving a report, distancing\
  \ himself from the weight of his own thoughts and feelings.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.2=For some reason, Barry refuses to use contractions, insists on\
  \ calling drinks beverages, and addresses teammates with full rank and title?even at the bar.\
  \ Whether he?s doing it on purpose or not, no one really knows, but it never stops being just a\
  \ little funny.

FURNITURE.label=Constantly Rearranges Furniture
FURNITURE.description.0=Barry is always looking for the optimal setup. Whether it?s\
  \ adjusting a chair for better ergonomics or shifting a table to maximize space, he can?t leave\
  \ a room alone until everything is arranged just right.
FURNITURE.description.1=In a world full of chaos, this is one thing he can control. Barry\
  \ constantly moves furniture, organizing and reorganizing as if it will bring order to the\
  \ disorder in his mind. It?s not about comfort?it?s about keeping himself from falling apart.
FURNITURE.description.2=No one ever knows what the room will look like when Barry?s around.\
  \ Chairs mysteriously shift overnight, tables migrate, and nothing is ever where it was the day\
  \ before. Whether he?s doing it for function or just to mess with people, he?s not telling.

GLASSES.label=Constantly Adjusts Glasses
GLASSES.description.0=Barry adjusts his glasses instinctively while deep in thought.\
  \ Whether he?s strategizing, reading data, or considering his next move, the subtle push-up on\
  \ the bridge of his nose is just part of his thinking process.
GLASSES.description.1=His hands need something to do, and adjusting his glasses keeps them\
  \ steady. Whether it?s stress, exhaustion, or memories creeping in, that small motion is his way\
  \ of grounding himself when things feel unstable.
GLASSES.description.2=Barry doesn?t just adjust his glasses?he does it with flair. A slow,\
  \ deliberate push accompanied by a knowing smirk, a mid-sentence tilt before making a point, or\
  \ even the classic glasses flash when the lighting hits just right. If he?s doing it for effect,\
  \ it?s working.

GLOVES.label=Always Wearing Gloves
GLOVES.description.0=Barry wears gloves because they?re useful. Whether it?s for grip, protection,\
  \ or just to keep his hands ready for action, he sees them as an essential part of his gear?like\
  \ a pilot never stepping into a 'Mech without a helmet.
GLOVES.description.1=There?s a reason Barry never takes his gloves off. Maybe it?s old scars,\
  \ burns, or something he doesn?t want anyone to see. Whatever it is, the gloves stay on, and he\
  \ doesn?t talk about why.
GLOVES.description.2=For Barry, gloves aren?t just an accessory?they?re a statement. Whether\
  \ they?re sleek leather, reinforced pilot gloves, or fingerless for ?extra dexterity,? he wears\
  \ them with confidence. Maybe it?s habit, maybe it?s flair, but either way, they?re always part\
  \ of the look.

HAND_GESTURES.label=Excessive Hand Gestures
HAND_GESTURES.description.0=Barry talks with his hands. Every conversation is full of animated\
  \ gestures?pointing, waving, chopping the air?making it impossible to ignore him. His energy is\
  \ infectious, and whether he?s giving orders or telling a story, his movements make sure no one zones out.
HAND_GESTURES.description.1=The hands never stop moving. Barry gestures constantly, sometimes\
  \ forcefully, sometimes unconsciously, as if trying to physically push his words into existence.\
  \ It?s not just habit?it?s a nervous outlet, a way to keep from breaking under the pressure of\
  \ everything unsaid.
HAND_GESTURES.description.2=Barry?s hand gestures are an event. A simple explanation becomes a\
  \ dramatic reenactment, a debate turns into a full-blown performance, and even casual\
  \ conversations come with sweeping motions like he?s directing an invisible orchestra. Subtle?\
  \ Not even a little.

HAND_WRINGER.label=Compulsive Hand-Wringer
HAND_WRINGER.description.0=Barry?s hands are never still. He wrings them absentmindedly,\
  \ twisting his fingers together when deep in thought or under pressure. It?s not something he\
  \ realizes he?s doing, but it?s a clear sign when something?s weighing on his mind.
HAND_WRINGER.description.1=His hands are always moving, like he?s trying to scrub away something\
  \ unseen. Maybe it?s past mistakes, maybe it?s blood?real or imagined. Barry wrings his hands\
  \ constantly, a habit that betrays a mind haunted by things he?ll never say out loud.
HAND_WRINGER.description.2=Barry isn?t nervous?he?s processing. The hand-wringing isn?t\
  \ hesitation, it?s a thinking mechanism. He grips his hands tightly, deep in thought, running\
  \ through scenarios, adjusting plans, and calculating his next move while everyone else is still\
  \ reacting.

HANDSHAKE.label=Overly Enthusiastic Handshake
HANDSHAKE.description.0=Barry?s handshake is firm, loud, and full of energy. Whether he?s\
  \ meeting someone for the first time or greeting an old friend, he grips hard, pumps their arm\
  \ like he?s trying to start an engine, and makes sure they feel his enthusiasm.
HANDSHAKE.description.1=The handshake is a test. Barry grips too hard, holds too long, and\
  \ stares just a little too intensely. Whether it?s dominance, desperation, or a need to prove\
  \ something, every handshake is a contest?one he refuses to lose.
HANDSHAKE.description.2=Barry doesn?t mean to nearly rip people?s arms off?it just happens.\
  \ He?s a little too excited, a little too strong, and a little too unaware of how much force he?s\
  \ using. People brace themselves when he offers a handshake, but no one can say he lacks\
  \ enthusiasm.

HEADPHONES.label=Always Wearing Headphones
HEADPHONES.description.0=Barry is always plugged in, lost in his own world of music, podcasts, or\
  \ mission briefings. Whether he?s zoning out to his favorite tracks or using white noise to\
  \ concentrate, the headphones are a permanent fixture?his personal escape from the noise of\
  \ reality.
HEADPHONES.description.1=The headphones aren?t just for music?they?re a barrier. Barry keeps them\
  \ on to block out the voices, the war, the past. Whether there?s sound playing or not, they help\
  \ keep the world at a distance, a subtle way to avoid getting too close to anyone.
HEADPHONES.description.2=Barry wears his headphones everywhere, even in completely inappropriate\
  \ situations. They might not even be playing anything?he just likes the feel of them. Half the\
  \ time, people aren?t sure if he?s listening or ignoring them on purpose, and honestly, he?s fine\
  \ with that.

HEALTHY_SNACKS.label=Frequently Snacking on Healthy Foods
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.0=Barry treats his body like a well-tuned machine, and that means\
  \ fueling it properly. He?s always munching on nuts, dried fruit, or protein bars, making sure\
  \ he?s getting the right nutrients at the right times?because peak performance doesn?t happen by\
  \ accident.
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.1=Eating small, frequent meals isn?t just a habit?it?s a necessity.\
  \ Barry learned the hard way that you never know when your next full meal will come, so he keeps\
  \ healthy snacks on hand to stay ready for anything. Hunger isn?t just discomfort?it?s a weakness\
  \ he refuses to allow.
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.2=Barry will go into a firefight with carrot sticks in his pocket and\
  \ absolutely will offer someone kale chips in the middle of a strategy meeting. He swears by his\
  \ health snacks, passionately debates the best brands, and refuses to let anyone shame him for it.

HISTORIAN.label=Passionate about History
HISTORIAN.description.0=Barry doesn?t just like history?he lives it. He can recite battle\
  \ strategies from wars long past, analyze historical leaders? decisions, and draw connections\
  \ between ancient conflicts and modern tactics. To him, understanding the past is the key to\
  \ mastering the future.
HISTORIAN.description.1=History isn?t just something Barry studies?it?s something he carries.\
  \ He fixates on past wars, past mistakes, and the cycles of destruction that seem doomed to\
  \ repeat. He reads history like a warning, desperately trying to learn from those who fell before\
  \ him so he doesn?t share their fate.
HISTORIAN.description.2=Barry will turn any conversation into a history lesson. Whether it?s\
  \ comparing a bar fight to a famous battlefield maneuver or using obscure political alliances to\
  \ justify why he picked a certain meal, he can?t not bring up history. His passion is undeniable\
  \ - his timing, however, could use some work.

HUMMER.label=Habitual Hummer
HUMMER.description.0=Barry hums constantly?a tune stuck in his head, a song he barely remembers, or\
  \ just an improvised melody. It?s second nature to him, a little sign that no matter how tough\
  \ things get, he?s still got music inside him.
HUMMER.description.1=The humming isn?t just a habit?it?s a shield. Barry hums to drown out the\
  \ silence, to keep his mind from wandering into places he doesn?t want to go. It?s quiet, almost\
  \ subconscious, a sound to remind himself he?s still here, still moving, still alive.
HUMMER.description.2=Barry?s humming never stops, and it?s just loud enough to drive people insane.\
  \ He hums through mission briefings, while fixing his 'Mech, even while sneaking through enemy\
  \ territory. Half the time, he?s not even aware he?s doing it?he?s just got a built-in soundtrack\
  \ running at all times.

HYGIENIC.label=Obsessed with Hygiene
HYGIENIC.description.0=Barry believes cleanliness is next to efficiency. His uniform is\
  \ always spotless, his gear meticulously maintained, and his hygiene routine unwavering. A clean\
  \ soldier is a prepared soldier, and he refuses to let grime slow him down.
HYGIENIC.description.1=Dirt, sweat, and blood feel wrong on his skin. Barry scrubs his hands\
  \ raw, constantly checks his surroundings for filth, and keeps disinfectant on him at all times.\
  \ Maybe it?s paranoia, maybe it?s trauma, but to him, staying clean isn?t just a habit?it?s\
  \ survival.
HYGIENIC.description.2=Barry will lecture teammates on the proper way to wash hands, carries\
  \ a ridiculous number of sanitizing wipes, and will side-eye anyone who doesn?t shower daily.\
  \ He?s not trying to be annoying?he just genuinely doesn?t understand how people can live with so\
  \ much dirt.

IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.label=Unusual Sleep Patterns
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.0=Barry?s sleep schedule is chaos. Some nights he crashes for 12\
  \ hours, other times he runs on two. He naps when he can, stays up when he shouldn?t, and somehow\
  \ manages to function?though no one really understands how.
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.1=Sleep doesn?t come easy. When Barry does sleep, it?s restless,\
  \ filled with half-remembered battles and decisions that haunt him. He goes as long as he can\
  \ without closing his eyes, only giving in when exhaustion finally wins.
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.2=Barry has rules for his sleep, and they don?t make sense to anyone\
  \ but him. 26-minute naps? Check. A strict rotation between 3-hour and 5-hour nights? Absolutely.\
  \ Somehow, he swears it works?even if no one else could survive it.

JOKER.label=Fond of Puns
JOKER.description.0=Barry lives for wordplay. Whether it?s a casual conversation or a tense\
  \ standoff, he always finds a way to slip in a pun?usually followed by his own amused chuckle.\
  \ It?s all in good fun, even if his teammates roll their eyes.
JOKER.description.1=The worse the situation, the more Barry leans into puns. It?s not just humor -\
  \ it?s armor. A battlefield littered with wreckage? "Looks like someone had a breakdown." A\
  \ near-death experience? "Well, that was a close shave." He cracks jokes to keep the darkness at\
  \ bay.
JOKER.description.2=Barry doesn?t just like puns?he weaponizes them. He strings them together in\
  \ rapid succession, derails conversations with groan-worthy wordplay, and refuses to stop until\
  \ he gets a reaction. His teammates may groan, but secretly, they?d miss it if he ever stopped.

LISTS.label=Compulsive List Maker
LISTS.description.0=Barry swears by his lists?daily tasks, mission priorities, supply inventories,\
  \ even rankings of his favorite 'Mechs. If something needs to be done, it goes on a list, and if\
  \ it?s not on a list, it might as well not exist.
LISTS.description.1=In an unpredictable world, Barry clings to his lists like a lifeline. They?re\
  \ not just notes?they?re order in the chaos. He keeps lists of people he?s lost, battles fought,\
  \ debts owed. It?s a way to stay grounded, to not forget what matters.
LISTS.description.2=Barry makes lists for everything. Best one-liners he?s ever heard? Listed. Top\
  \ five drinks he?s had in backwater bars? Documented. Worst mistakes he?s ever made? Hopefully\
  \ misplaced. He swears it helps keep his mind sharp?though his teammates suspect he just likes\
  \ making lists.

LITERAL.label=Overly Literal
LITERAL.description.0=Barry takes everything at face value. Sarcasm, metaphors, and jokes often go\
  \ over his head, and he answers rhetorical questions completely seriously. He?s not trying to be\
  \ difficult?he just believes words should mean exactly what they say.
LITERAL.description.1=Life is harsh, and Barry doesn?t waste time with flowery speech or double\
  \ meanings. He interprets everything literally because precision matters?misunderstandings get\
  \ people killed. If someone tells him to ?drop everything,? he will ask for clarification before\
  \ letting go of the mission-critical data.
LITERAL.description.2=Barry?s literal nature leads to endless miscommunications. If someone says,\
  \ ?Give me a second,? he?ll actually count to one. ?Hit the lights?? Expect a punch to the\
  \ nearest switch. His inability to pick up on figures of speech frustrates some?but it?s also\
  \ impossible not to laugh at.

LOCKS.label=Checks Locks Repeatedly
LOCKS.description.0=Barry double-checks every lock out of pure habit. Whether it?s his cockpit,\
  \ his quarters, or a supply cache, he needs to be sure it?s secure. It?s not paranoia?it?s just\
  \ being thorough.
LOCKS.description.1=Locks mean safety, and Barry can?t shake the feeling that if he doesn?t check\
  \ them, something terrible will happen. He runs his fingers over latches, tests doors twice (or\
  \ three times), and sometimes wakes in the middle of the night just to confirm what he already\
  \ knows?everything is locked.
LOCKS.description.2=Barry?s lock-checking is compulsive and oddly entertaining. He?ll finish\
  \ securing a door, walk away, then immediately turn back to check again. ?Just making sure.? His\
  \ team teases him for it, but hey?at least they never have to worry about surprise visitors.

MEASURED_TALKER.label=Tends to Speak in a Measured Pace
MEASURED_TALKER.description.0=Barry chooses his words carefully, speaking with deliberate control.\
  \ He never rushes, never stumbles?everything he says is well-formed and intentional. When he\
  \ speaks, people listen, because they know every word matters.
MEASURED_TALKER.description.1=Years of hardship have trained Barry to speak carefully. He measures\
  \ his tone, controls his volume, and never lets emotion slip into his words unless he wants it\
  \ to. His slow, steady speech isn?t just a habit?it?s a way to stay in control.
MEASURED_TALKER.description.2=Barry speaks like every word carries weight, drawing people in with\
  \ his deliberate cadence. His slow, steady delivery makes even the most mundane statements sound\
  \ profound. Whether he actually knows something deep or just enjoys the effect, no one?s quite\
  \ sure.

MINIMALIST.label=Extreme Minimalism
MINIMALIST.description.0=Barry owns only what he needs, nothing more. His quarters are bare, his\
  \ gear is strictly functional, and he sees excess as unnecessary weight. In his mind, if\
  \ something doesn?t serve a purpose, it?s just a distraction.
MINIMALIST.description.1=Material things don?t matter?people die, homes get destroyed, and\
  \ belongings are lost. Barry keeps only the bare essentials because he refuses to grow attached\
  \ to anything he might have to leave behind.
MINIMALIST.description.2=Barry?s extreme minimalism is both impressive and baffling. He sleeps on a\
  \ nearly empty bunk, owns exactly one spare outfit, and somehow survives with fewer personal\
  \ belongings than a rookie on their first deployment. He insists it keeps life simple?his\
  \ teammates just think it?s weird.

MUG.label=Prefers Using a Specific Mug
MUG.description.0=Barry?s mug isn?t just a drinking vessel?it?s his mug. No matter where he is, he\
  \ always uses the same one, whether for coffee, tea, or the occasional stronger drink. It?s\
  \ familiar, reliable, and just feels right in his hands.
MUG.description.1=The mug is more than just an object?it?s a reminder. Maybe it was a gift from\
  \ someone he lost, a relic from a past life, or the last thing that survived a destroyed home. He\
  \ won?t talk about why it matters, but if anyone so much as touches it, they?ll regret it.
MUG.description.2=Barry?s attachment to his mug is borderline ridiculous. He refuses to use any\
  \ other cup, goes out of his way to clean it immediately after use, and will absolutely make a\
  \ scene if someone borrows it. No one understands why it?s so important?but at this point, no one\
  \ dares question it.

NAIL_BITER.label=Constant Nail Biter
NAIL_BITER.description.0=Barry doesn?t even realize he?s doing it half the time. Whether he?s\
  \ thinking, waiting, or under stress, his fingers find their way to his mouth instinctively. It?s\
  \ not about anxiety?it?s just a deeply ingrained habit he never bothered to break.
NAIL_BITER.description.1=The nail-biting is a symptom of something deeper. Barry?s been through too\
  \ much, seen too many close calls, and the tension never fully leaves him. He chews at his nails\
  \ like he?s gnawing away at the pressure, as if the act itself might stop the worst from\
  \ happening.
NAIL_BITER.description.2=Barry knows it?s a gross habit?he just doesn?t care. No amount of teasing,\
  \ warnings, or disgusted looks from teammates will stop him. "Keeps me focused," he shrugs,\
  \ biting down on a nail mid-sentence. "Besides, I don?t need 'em to do my job."

NICKNAMING.label=Frequent Nicknaming
NICKNAMING.description.0=Barry hands out nicknames like they?re ration packs. Whether it?s a\
  \ twist on someone?s name, a reference to a past mission, or something entirely random, no one\
  \ stays nickname-free around him. It?s his way of making people feel like part of the crew.
NICKNAMING.description.1=Names hold weight, and Barry avoids using them when he can. Giving\
  \ people nicknames is easier?it keeps things light, keeps attachments from getting too real. If\
  \ they go down, it?s just "Sparky" or "Hotshot," not someone he let himself care about too much.
NICKNAMING.description.2=Barry?s nicknaming makes no sense. One day you?re "Ace," the next\
  \ you?re "Cabbage," and somehow he never explains why. His names range from fitting to completely\
  \ ridiculous, but once he picks one, good luck getting him to stop using it.

NIGHT_OWL.label=Night Owl
NIGHT_OWL.description.0=Barry does his best thinking when the rest of the world is asleep.\
  \ Late at night, he refines strategies, fine-tunes his ?Mech, or just enjoys the silence. While\
  \ others wake up groggy, he?s already hours into his day?just on a different schedule.
NIGHT_OWL.description.1=Sleep doesn?t come easy. Barry stays up not because he wants to, but\
  \ because every time he closes his eyes, something from the past creeps in. He fills the long\
  \ hours with maintenance, reports, or just staring at the stars, avoiding the moment when\
  \ exhaustion finally wins.
NIGHT_OWL.description.2=Barry thrives at night. He?s chatty, full of energy, and always up\
  \ for a conversation?at 2 AM. Morning meetings? Forget it. Before noon, he?s a barely functional\
  \ husk of a human, relying on caffeine and sheer willpower to survive.

NOTE_TAKER.label=Compulsive Note-Taking
NOTE_TAKER.description.0=Barry writes everything down?battle strategies, mission reports, random\
  \ observations, even things that seem trivial. His notes are meticulously structured,\
  \ cross-referenced, and indexed. If anyone needs to remember something, Barry?s probably got it\
  \ written down somewhere.
NOTE_TAKER.description.1=There?s too much to keep track of, too much that could be lost. Barry\
  \ takes notes because he has to?names, places, orders, debts owed, things he can?t afford to\
  \ forget. Whether it?s from trauma, paranoia, or sheer survival instinct, he needs the record to\
  \ remind himself what?s real.
NOTE_TAKER.description.2=Barry?s notes are everywhere. Napkins, scraps of paper, even the back of\
  \ his hand?he writes down thoughts before they vanish. The problem? His handwriting is awful,\
  \ half the notes don?t make sense later, and his teammates often find cryptic phrases like ?NEVER\
  \ TRUST A MAN WITH TWO WATCHES? with zero explanation.

NOTEBOOK.label=Always Carrying a Notebook
NOTEBOOK.description.0=Barry?s notebook is his lifeline. Inside, it holds mission details, tactical\
  \ observations, supply lists, and anything else worth remembering. He treats it like a second\
  \ brain?if something?s important, it gets written down.
NOTEBOOK.description.1=The notebook isn?t just for logistics?it?s for remembrance. Barry jots down\
  \ names, places, and events that he refuses to forget. Whether it?s fallen comrades, debts owed,\
  \ or things he regrets, the pages carry what his mind struggles to hold onto.
NOTEBOOK.description.2=Barry?s notebook is a chaotic masterpiece. One page is a battle plan, the\
  \ next is a half-finished sketch, and somewhere in the middle is a running list of ?Top 10\
  \ Dumbest Things I?ve Seen in the Field.? He swears there?s a system?no one else believes him.

OBJECT.label=Carries a Personal Object
OBJECT.description.0=Barry keeps a small personal item with him at all times?a locket, a worn-out\
  \ coin, or an old insignia. It?s not for show; it?s a reminder of where he came from and the\
  \ people who shaped him. No matter how far he goes, this one thing keeps him anchored.
OBJECT.description.1=The object he carries isn?t just sentimental?it?s a scar made tangible. Maybe\
  \ it?s a bullet casing from the battle that changed him, a broken dog tag from someone he failed\
  \ to save, or a letter he never sent. It?s a relic of his past, something he can?t let go of, no\
  \ matter how much it weighs on him.
OBJECT.description.2=Barry?s personal item is oddly specific. Maybe it?s a lucky wrench, a pebble\
  \ from some forgotten battlefield, or a tiny carved figure he refuses to explain. It might look\
  \ like junk to everyone else, but to him, it?s priceless?and if anyone tries to take it, they?ll\
  \ regret it.

ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.label=Obsessive Organizational Tendencies
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.0=Everything Barry owns has a place, and nothing is ever out\
  \ of order. His gear is meticulously arranged, his mission plans are color-coded, and his\
  \ inventory tracking is borderline military-grade. Chaos is unacceptable?order is efficiency.
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.1=Organization isn?t just a habit?it?s survival. The universe\
  \ is unpredictable, people die, plans fail. But Barry can control this. Every item is cataloged;\
  \ every file is where it belongs. If he lets things slip, even a little, he feels like everything\
  \ else might unravel, too.
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.2=Barry takes organization to extreme levels. His storage\
  \ system has storage systems, his tools are labeled with names, and his filing system is so\
  \ complex that even he sometimes forgets how it works. He insists it makes perfect sense?his\
  \ teammates aren?t so sure.

ORGANIZER.label=Always Organizing
ORGANIZER.description.0=Barry can?t stand disorder. Whether it?s straightening maps, aligning gear,\
  \ or reordering supply crates, he constantly tidies up to maximize efficiency. A well-organized\
  \ space means a well-organized mind, and he refuses to work in chaos.
ORGANIZER.description.1=Everything else in life is unpredictable?war, people, survival. But this?\
  \ This he can control. Barry organizes because it keeps his mind from spiraling. If everything is\
  \ in its place, maybe, just maybe, things won?t fall apart.
ORGANIZER.description.2=Barry?s urge to organize is compulsive. Leave a table messy? He?ll fix it.\
  \ Gear out of order? He?s already on it. Even if it?s not his stuff, he?ll start rearranging\
  \ things, sometimes mid-conversation. His team has given up fighting it?they just let him do his\
  \ thing.

ORIGAMI.label=Fond of Origami
ORIGAMI.description.0=Barry finds peace in folding paper. Whether it?s a simple crane or a complex\
  \ dragon, each fold is precise, deliberate, and controlled. It?s a quiet, meditative practice\
  \ that helps him focus in a world of constant noise.
ORIGAMI.description.1=Origami is more than just a hobby?it?s a way to keep his hands busy. When he\
  \ can?t sleep, when the memories creep in, when the weight of war presses too hard, he folds. A\
  \ battlefield littered with paper cranes might be the only sign he was there at all.
ORIGAMI.description.2=Barry leaves tiny paper creations everywhere. A frog on the command console,\
  \ a fox in someone?s locker, a star tucked into a pocket?his teammates never know when or where\
  \ they?ll find one, but at this point, they?ve just accepted that Barry expresses himself in\
  \ folded paper.

OVER_PLANNER.label=Obsessive Over-Planner
OVER_PLANNER.description.0=Barry doesn?t just plan?he engineers every outcome. Backup strategies,\
  \ contingency routes, worst-case scenario drills?he refuses to be caught off guard. If something\
  \ can go wrong, he?s already got a plan for it.
OVER_PLANNER.description.1=The universe is unpredictable, and that terrifies him. Barry over-plans\
  \ not because he wants to, but because he has to. If he stops thinking ahead, stops preparing for\
  \ every disaster, he feels like everything will collapse. His plans aren?t just strategy?they?re\
  \ survival.
OVER_PLANNER.description.2=Barry?s over-planning is legendary. Need a simple supply run? He?s got a\
  \ 12-step action plan, a risk assessment, and a backup plan for the backup plan. His teammates\
  \ appreciate his foresight?until they have to sit through another one of his hour-long briefing\
  \ sessions.

OVEREXPLAINER.label=Chronic Overexplainer
OVEREXPLAINER.description.0=Barry believes every detail matters. Whether he?s explaining a battle\
  \ strategy or how to fix a ?Mech, he lays out every step, every possibility, and every potential\
  \ complication. He?s not trying to be tedious?he just wants people to be fully prepared.
OVEREXPLAINER.description.1=If he doesn?t explain everything, something will go wrong. Barry\
  \ repeats instructions, clarifies minor points, and double-checks that everyone understands\
  \ because mistakes mean casualties. Overexplaining isn?t just habit?it?s his way of trying to\
  \ stop bad things before they happen.
OVEREXPLAINER.description.2=Barry?s explanations never end. A simple question about comms settings\
  \ turns into a history lesson on radio frequencies, and a casual remark about armor plating\
  \ somehow evolves into a full-blown lecture on metallurgy. His team has learned to either stop\
  \ him early?or just let him talk and tune him out halfway through.

PEN_CLICKER.label=Habitual Pen Clicker
PEN_CLICKER.description.0=Barry?s pen is always clicking. It?s not a conscious habit?it?s just\
  \ something he does while thinking, planning, or waiting. The rapid click-click-click is his way\
  \ of staying engaged, even if it drives everyone around him insane.
PEN_CLICKER.description.1=The clicking isn?t just a habit?it?s a tell. Barry?s hands need something\
  \ to do, and if he?s clicking his pen, it means his mind is racing. Stress, bad memories, or a\
  \ situation spiraling out of control?the sound is his subconscious way of holding himself\
  \ together.
PEN_CLICKER.description.2=Barry knows the pen clicking annoys people. He also doesn?t care. If\
  \ someone reacts, he just clicks faster. If they take his pen, he?s got another one. Whether it?s\
  \ boredom, stubbornness, or pure amusement, he treats the clicking like a personal challenge?how\
  \ long can he go before someone snaps?

PEN_TWIRLER.label=Habitual Pen Twirler
PEN_TWIRLER.description.0=Barry twirls his pen constantly?while listening, while waiting, even\
  \ while explaining something himself. It?s second nature, something his hands do without\
  \ thinking, a quiet rhythm that helps him focus.
PEN_TWIRLER.description.1=The spinning isn?t just a habit?it?s a release. Barry?s always holding\
  \ something back, always teetering between control and tension. The pen twirls faster when he?s\
  \ anxious, slower when he?s deep in thought, but it never stops moving.
PEN_TWIRLER.description.2=Barry doesn?t just twirl his pen?he performs with it. Smooth spins,\
  \ between-the-fingers maneuvers, even full toss-and-catch tricks in the middle of conversations.\
  \ It?s impressive, sure?but also infuriating when he drops it mid-strategy briefing and pretends\
  \ nothing happened.

PERSONIFICATION.label=Overly Friendly with Equipment
PERSONIFICATION.description.0=Barry talks to his gear like it?s an old friend. His ?Mech, his\
  \ weapons, even his comms unit all have names, and he offers them words of encouragement like,\
  \ ?Come on, don?t fail me now, sweetheart.? It?s not just a quirk?it?s respect for the tools that\
  \ keep him alive.
PERSONIFICATION.description.1=Machines don?t betray, don?t die for senseless reasons, don?t leave\
  \ him behind. Barry treats his equipment like trusted allies, whispering reassurances, patting\
  \ armor plating, and sometimes talking to his ?Mech late at night as if it can actually hear him.
PERSONIFICATION.description.2=Barry?s relationship with his gear is borderline ridiculous. He?ll\
  \ scold his rifle for jamming, apologize to a ?Mech when patching it up, and get personally\
  \ offended if someone mistreats his tools. His teammates have stopped questioning it?it?s just\
  \ Barry being Barry.

PESSIMIST.label=Habitual Pessimist
PESSIMIST.description.0=Barry doesn?t expect the worst?he plans for it. Every mission, every\
  \ interaction, every choice has a downside, and he makes sure everyone knows it. It?s not\
  \ negativity, it?s realism?at least, that?s what he tells himself.
PESSIMIST.description.1=Experience has taught Barry that things always go wrong. He?s seen too\
  \ much, lost too many people, and stopped believing in ?best-case scenarios? a long time ago.\
  \ When something does work out, he?s more suspicious than relieved.
PESSIMIST.description.2=Barry complains about everything, always predicting disaster with a sigh\
  \ and a shake of his head. ?Oh sure, this plan sounds great, until we?re all stranded in a swamp\
  \ fighting for our lives.? His teammates roll their eyes, but secretly, they rely on his\
  \ instincts?because somehow, he?s usually right.

PHRASES.label=Tends to Use Specific Phrases
PHRASES.description.0=Barry has a set of go-to phrases that never change. Whether it?s ?That?s a\
  \ terrible idea?let?s do it? or ?Well, that could?ve gone worse?, his teammates always know what\
  \ he?s going to say before he says it.
PHRASES.description.1=Some of Barry?s phrases aren?t just habits?they?re memories. Maybe he picked\
  \ them up from a fallen mentor, an old comrade, or a past life he barely acknowledges. The words\
  \ stick, and even if no one else knows their meaning, he can?t bring himself to stop saying them.
PHRASES.description.2=Barry?s catchphrases range from cynical one-liners (?Oh, this is gonna end\
  \ well.?) to dry observations (?I?d love to say I?m surprised, but??). His teammates groan every\
  \ time he uses one, but deep down, they?d probably worry if he ever stopped.

PLANTS.label=Loves Plants
PLANTS.description.0=Barry keeps a small collection of plants, tending to them with as\
  \ much care as his gear. He appreciates their resilience, their quiet presence, and the bit of\
  \ life they bring to an otherwise harsh existence. In a world of war and metal, plants remind him\
  \ that things can still grow.
PLANTS.description.1=Plants are delicate, fleeting?everything he isn?t. Barry surrounds\
  \ himself with them because they remind him of something softer, something worth protecting.\
  \ Maybe it?s guilt, maybe it?s longing, but when the battles end, he finds himself whispering\
  \ apologies to leaves that never judge.
PLANTS.description.2=Barry treats his plants like they?re part of the team. He talks to\
  \ them, names them, and might even refer to them in conversations like, ?Well, Sergeant Fern\
  \ thinks this is a terrible idea.? His squadmates joke about it, but they secretly admire his\
  \ dedication?and the fact that he somehow keeps them all alive.

POLITE.label=Excessive Politeness
POLITE.description.0=Barry believes that good manners cost nothing. He addresses people formally,\
  \ says "please" and "thank you" even in combat, and never forgets to acknowledge others. To him,\
  \ respect is a sign of discipline, no matter the situation.
POLITE.description.1=Politeness is Barry?s armor. He keeps conversations stiff and courteous, using\
  \ formality as a barrier between himself and the world. No matter how brutal the situation, his\
  \ words remain calm and measured?because if he lets that slip, everything might fall apart.
POLITE.description.2=Barry?s politeness is relentless. He apologizes to enemies as he shoots them,\
  \ thanks his ?Mech before battle, and refers to superiors and rivals alike with full, proper\
  \ titles. Even in the worst situations, he refuses to drop the manners?whether out of habit or\
  \ just to confuse people.

PRACTICAL_JOKER.label=Loves Practical Jokes
PRACTICAL_JOKER.description.0=Barry?s pranks are lighthearted and good-natured?swapping sugar for\
  \ salt, moving someone?s chair an inch to the left, or rigging a harmless sound effect into a\
  \ cockpit console. He never takes it too far, just enough to keep things entertaining.
PRACTICAL_JOKER.description.1=In a world full of war and loss, laughter is survival. Barry pulls\
  \ pranks because the universe is cruel, not despite it. If he can make someone smile, even for a\
  \ second, then maybe things aren?t completely hopeless. His jokes are his way of keeping the\
  \ darkness at bay.
PRACTICAL_JOKER.description.2=Barry?s pranks are legendary?and dangerously elaborate. Swapping two\
  \ identical ?Mechs? Done it. Replacing a commander?s chair with one that slowly sinks? Classic.\
  \ Leaving cryptic notes just to watch people freak out? A favorite. No one?s safe, and Barry\
  \ wouldn?t have it any other way.

PREPARED.label=Always Prepared
PREPARED.description.0=Barry has a plan for everything. Backup weapons, extra ammo, emergency\
  \ rations?he carries gear most people wouldn?t think of until it?s too late. When things go\
  \ sideways, he?s the one pulling exactly what?s needed out of nowhere.
PREPARED.description.1=Experience has taught Barry that only fools trust the universe. He prepares\
  \ for disaster because disaster always happens. Whether it?s escape routes, hidden supplies, or\
  \ keeping a weapon within arm?s reach at all times, he stays ready?because getting caught off\
  \ guard means dying.
PREPARED.description.2=Barry?s preparedness is borderline absurd. Need duct tape? He?s got three\
  \ kinds. A sewing kit? Of course. A fully mapped-out plan for what to do if the base gets invaded\
  \ by space pirates? Obviously. No one questions it anymore?they just accept that Barry always has\
  \ a solution.

PUNCTUAL.label=Overly Punctual
PUNCTUAL.description.0=Barry treats punctuality as a core principle. If he?s not at least five\
  \ minutes early, he considers himself late. Schedules, mission briefings, even casual meetups?he\
  \ arrives on time, every time, and expects others to do the same.
PUNCTUAL.description.1=Timing is everything. Barry learned the hard way that being late can mean\
  \ the difference between life and death. He must be on time, must control every second, because\
  \ if he doesn?t, something could go horribly wrong?and it?ll be his fault.
PUNCTUAL.description.2=Barry takes punctuality to the extreme. He shows up before anyone else,\
  \ reminds people of schedules hours in advance, and gets visibly irritated when others run late.\
  \ If someone isn?t ready on time, he?ll stare at them until they feel deeply ashamed.

PUZZLES.label=Obsessed with Puzzles
PUZZLES.description.0=Barry sees puzzles as more than just games?they?re mental training. Whether\
  \ it?s a cryptic riddle, a complex battlefield maneuver, or a mechanical problem, he approaches\
  \ everything like a puzzle waiting to be solved. To him, strategy is a game of patterns and\
  \ solutions.
PUZZLES.description.1=Puzzles are the only thing that make sense in a chaotic universe. Barry\
  \ clings to logic, patterns, and solvable problems because they give him control?something\
  \ reality rarely offers. He stays up late solving encrypted messages, old war ciphers, or complex\
  \ mechanical failures, because if he stops thinking, the ghosts creep in.
PUZZLES.description.2=Barry cannot resist a puzzle. Crosswords, riddles, mechanical locks?if\
  \ there?s a problem to crack, he has to solve it. He?ll ignore meals, push back sleep, and drag\
  \ teammates into his obsession ("Come on, just one more clue!") until it?s finally figured out.

QUOTES.label=Collects Quotes
QUOTES.description.0=Barry believes words have power. He keeps a notebook full of quotes -\
  \ battlefield wisdom, ancient philosophy, even lines from old holovids. Whether for inspiration\
  \ or just perspective, he always has a quote ready for the moment.
QUOTES.description.1=Sometimes, quotes are all he has left. Barry writes down the last words of\
  \ fallen comrades, the sayings of long-dead leaders, or things people have told him that matter.\
  \ He might not even believe in them?but if he stops collecting them, he fears he?ll forget what\
  \ they stood for.
QUOTES.description.2=Barry?s quote collection is ridiculously diverse. One moment, he?s reciting a\
  \ legendary general?s speech?the next, it?s a line from a terrible action movie. His comrades never\
  \ knows what to expect, but one thing?s for sure: Barry always has a quote for any situation.

RARELY_SLEEPS.label=Rarely Sleeps
RARELY_SLEEPS.description.0=Barry treats sleep as a luxury rather than a necessity. There?s always\
  \ another strategy to refine, another ?Mech to maintain, another report to analyze. He powers\
  \ through exhaustion with sheer will and caffeine, convinced that resting means falling behind.
RARELY_SLEEPS.description.1=Sleep is when the ghosts come. Barry avoids it as much as possible,\
  \ keeping himself awake with work, noise, or anything that drowns out the past. When he does\
  \ sleep, it?s shallow, restless, and short?just enough to keep moving, but never enough to truly\
  \ rest.
RARELY_SLEEPS.description.2=Barry?s ability to function on almost no sleep is legendary. He?ll take\
  \ 15-minute power naps, drink absurd amounts of coffee, and somehow remain sharper than people\
  \ running on eight hours. No one understands how he does it, but it?s both impressive and\
  \ slightly terrifying.

ROUTINE.label=Has a Routine for Small Tasks
ROUTINE.description.0=Barry believes that even the smallest tasks should be done right. Whether\
  \ it?s brewing coffee, checking his gear, or lacing his boots, he follows the exact same sequence\
  \ every time. It?s not just habit?it?s precision, and precision keeps him sharp.
ROUTINE.description.1=The universe is unpredictable, but his routines? Those are reliable. Barry\
  \ repeats the same steps?arranging tools just so, counting ammo a certain way, always tying his\
  \ left boot first?because in a world full of chaos, these tiny rituals give him control over\
  \ something.
ROUTINE.description.2=Barry?s small routines never change, and if someone interrupts them, it\
  \ throws him off completely. He?ll restart tasks if they don?t ?feel right,? refuses to let\
  \ anyone mess with his system, and will absolutely take an extra five minutes just to redo his\
  \ perfect coffee-making ritual.

SEEKS_APPROVAL.label=Constantly Seeking Approval
SEEKS_APPROVAL.description.0=Barry puts in extra effort, always making sure his work is noticed and\
  \ appreciated. Whether it?s impressing a superior, earning a teammate?s respect, or just getting\
  \ a nod of approval, he thrives on recognition and will push himself harder to earn it.
SEEKS_APPROVAL.description.1=No matter how much he accomplishes, it?s never enough. Barry\
  \ constantly second-guesses himself, looking to others for reassurance that he made the right\
  \ call. If approval isn?t given, he spirals into overthinking, wondering if he?s failed again.
SEEKS_APPROVAL.description.2=Barry isn?t shy about fishing for compliments. "Hey, did you see that\
  \ shot? Pretty impressive, right?" He plays it off as joking, but deep down, he craves\
  \ validation. Whether it?s for his skills, his leadership, or even just his choice of jacket, he\
  \ needs to hear that he?s doing well.

SENTIMENTAL.label=Overly Sentimental
SENTIMENTAL.description.0=Barry attaches deep meaning to everything?an old insignia, a worn-out\
  \ picture, even a dent in his ?Mech?s armor. Every item, every place, every person holds\
  \ significance, and he refuses to let go of the things that remind him of where he?s been.
SENTIMENTAL.description.1=Loss has shaped him, and he can?t move on. Barry holds onto keepsakes,\
  \ replays old conversations in his head, and sees ghosts in every battlefield. He?s not just\
  \ sentimental?he?s trapped by the weight of what he refuses to forget.
SENTIMENTAL.description.2=Barry gets sentimental over everything. He remembers the exact date he\
  \ first met someone, insists on celebrating small anniversaries, and absolutely keeps a\
  \ collection of trinkets with exaggerated stories attached. His teammates roll their eyes, but\
  \ deep down, they know he cares.

SHARPENING.label=Compulsive Sharpening
SHARPENING.description.0=Barry believes that a dull blade is a useless one. Whether it?s a combat\
  \ knife, a tool, or even a pencil, he has to keep it sharp. It?s not just maintenance?it?s about\
  \ being ready for anything at a moment?s notice.
SHARPENING.description.1=The rhythmic scrape of a whetstone keeps his hands busy, his mind focused,\
  \ and the past at bay. Barry sharpens constantly?not because his weapons need it, but because if\
  \ he stops, the silence creeps in, and he can?t handle that.
SHARPENING.description.2=Barry?s sharpening habits are borderline obsessive. He sharpens\
  \ everything, sometimes to impractical levels. He?s been caught honing the edge of a butter\
  \ knife, and his squad swears they once saw him sharpening a screwdriver. When questioned, he\
  \ just shrugs??You never know.?

SINGS.label=Sings to Themselves
SINGS.description.0=Barry hums and sings without a second thought, whether he?s tuning up his\
  \ ?Mech, walking through base, or waiting out a long mission. It?s never loud?just a quiet,\
  \ absentminded tune that follows him everywhere, adding a little warmth to the air around him.
SINGS.description.1=Singing is a habit he picked up to keep the silence from getting too loud.\
  \ Sometimes, it?s an old war ballad, sometimes just a half-remembered lullaby. When stress,\
  \ exhaustion, or old memories creep in, he sings?not for anyone else, but for himself, a fragile\
  \ tether to something softer.
SINGS.description.2=Barry doesn?t just sing?he performs. Whether it?s exaggerated renditions of\
  \ classic tunes, made-up battle anthems, or absurdly inappropriate songs for tense moments, he\
  \ keeps his squad entertained (or mildly annoyed). No one knows if he?s serious, but one thing?s\
  \ for sure?he never stops.

SKEPTICAL.label=Chronically Skeptical
SKEPTICAL.description.0=Barry doesn?t take things at face value. Every plan, every deal, every\
  \ piece of intel is met with scrutiny. He questions motives, double-checks information, and\
  \ assumes there?s always something someone isn?t telling him. To him, skepticism isn?t negativity\
  \ - it?s necessary.
SKEPTICAL.description.1=Trust is a luxury Barry can?t afford. He?s been lied to, betrayed, and seen\
  \ too many good people fall because they believed the wrong thing. Now, he questions everything -\
  \ not out of curiosity, but out of survival. If something sounds too good to be true, it\
  \ definitely is.
SKEPTICAL.description.2=Barry meets every claim with a raised eyebrow and a smirk. Whether it?s a\
  \ mission briefing (?Oh sure, ?minimal resistance,? I?ve heard that before?) or someone bragging\
  \ about their skills (?Right, and I?m the First Prince of the Federated Suns?), he?s always ready\
  \ with a snide remark. His squad finds it both frustrating and way too accurate.

SLEEP_TALKER.label=Talks in Sleep
SLEEP_TALKER.description.0=Barry?s sleep-talking is mostly nonsense. Random phrases, half-finished\
  \ thoughts, and the occasional muttered insult directed at who knows what. His squad has learned\
  \ to just nod along when he starts rambling in his sleep?it?s usually hilarious.
SLEEP_TALKER.description.1=His sleep isn?t restful?it?s reliving. Barry murmurs names, barks out\
  \ orders, and sometimes pleads with ghosts from battles long past. His teammates don?t mention\
  \ it, but they all know: whatever he?s dreaming about, it?s not something he?ll talk about when\
  \ he?s awake.
SLEEP_TALKER.description.2=Barry?s sleep-talking is oddly coherent. He gives full mission reports,\
  \ has conversations with people who aren?t there, and occasionally mutters unsettlingly specific\
  \ phrases like "Don?t trust the one with the blue gloves." No one knows why?and honestly, no one\
  \ wants to ask.

SMILER.label=Compulsive Smiler
SMILER.description.0=Barry?s default expression is a grin, and it?s genuine. Whether he?s greeting\
  \ a teammate, delivering bad news, or walking into a firefight, he always has a smile ready. To\
  \ him, a little warmth can go a long way, even in the worst situations.
SMILER.description.1=The smile never fades?but that doesn?t mean it?s real. Barry grins through\
  \ exhaustion, loss, and the weight of things he?ll never talk about. It?s a shield, a way to hide\
  \ the cracks, because if he stops smiling, he might not be able to hold everything together.
SMILER.description.2=Barry smiles constantly, and no one knows why. In tense moments? Smiling.\
  \ While delivering a casual threat? Still smiling. Even when injured? Big grin. It?s charming,\
  \ sure?but also just unnerving enough that his enemies never quite know what to make of him.

SNACKS.label=Always Has a Snack
SNACKS.description.0=Barry never goes anywhere without a snack. Protein bars, dried fruit, or a\
  \ pocket full of nuts?he keeps something on hand at all times. A good soldier stays fueled, and\
  \ he?s not about to let hunger slow him down.
SNACKS.description.1=You never know when your next meal will be your last. Barry keeps food stashed\
  \ everywhere?his cockpit, his locker, even inside his armor?s storage compartments. Maybe it?s\
  \ paranoia, maybe it?s a habit from leaner times, but he never risks going hungry.
SNACKS.description.2=Barry snacks constantly, usually on something oddly specific (?Spiced almonds\
  \ are the perfect battlefield food?). He?ll offer teammates bites of whatever he?s munching on\
  \ and will absolutely pull out a snack in the middle of a crisis, unfazed. Somehow, it just works\
  \ for him.

STORYTELLING.label=Compulsive Storytelling
STORYTELLING.description.0=Barry has a story for everything. Whether it?s a past mission, a\
  \ legendary pilot, or something completely absurd, he has to tell it. His stories are\
  \ entertaining, detailed, and sometimes just a little exaggerated?but that?s part of the charm.
STORYTELLING.description.1=Barry tells stories because the past is the only thing that still makes\
  \ sense. He repeats old war stories, memories of lost comrades, or even legends he barely\
  \ believes in?anything to remind himself (and others) that their struggles mean something.
STORYTELLING.description.2=Barry?s storytelling never ends. A simple question turns into a\
  \ 10-minute tale, a quiet moment becomes a dramatic reenactment, and no one escapes without\
  \ hearing at least one of his ?totally true? exploits. His squadmates have learned that if he\
  \ starts with "That reminds me of a time when..."?they?re in for a long ride.

STRETCHING.label=Constantly Stretching
STRETCHING.description.0=Barry treats his body like a well-maintained machine, and stretching is\
  \ part of that upkeep. Whether he?s prepping for battle, sitting through a briefing, or just\
  \ passing time, he?s always rolling his shoulders, cracking his neck, or doing a quick stretch\
  \ to stay loose and ready.
STRETCHING.description.1=The stretching isn?t just about fitness?it?s about control. Barry\
  \ stretches to shake off stiffness from too many sleepless nights, too many injuries, too much\
  \ time spent locked inside a cockpit. If he stops moving, even for a moment, he feels trapped.
STRETCHING.description.2=Barry?s stretching is constant and distracting. Mid-conversation? He?s\
  \ reaching for his toes. Mid-mission? A quick shoulder roll. Mid-firefight? Probably a wrist\
  \ stretch. He claims it helps him stay limber?his teammates mostly just sigh and accept it.

SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.label=Superstitious Rituals
SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.0=Barry doesn?t question his rituals?he just does them. Tapping\
  \ his ?Mech twice before starting it up, wearing a lucky patch during missions, never stepping\
  \ onto a battlefield with his left foot first. Maybe it?s habit, maybe it?s nonsense, but he\
  \ knows better than to tempt fate.
SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.1=Superstition is just another way to keep the chaos at bay.\
  \ Barry clings to his small rituals?muttering an old warrior?s prayer before battle, keeping a\
  \ spent shell casing from his first scenario?as if following them might keep death away for one\
  \ more day.
SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.2=Barry?s superstitions are deeply specific. Never eat the last\
  \ bite of a ration bar before a fight? Check. Always tighten his right glove twice before taking\
  \ a shot? Absolutely. His squad has stopped questioning it?because, somehow, his weird little\
  \ rituals seem to work.

SUPERVISED_HABITS.label=Highly Supervised Habits
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.0=Barry follows routines with military precision. Every action -\
  \ checking his gear, reviewing battle plans, even making coffee?is done the exact same way every\
  \ time. He supervises himself as if someone?s watching, because to him, perfection is in the\
  \ details.
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.1=Barry learned the hard way that one mistake can cost lives. Now, he\
  \ double-checks everything, monitoring his own actions like an officer reviewing a mission\
  \ report. Whether it?s paranoia or experience, he refuses to let carelessness be the reason\
  \ things go wrong.
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.2=Barry treats even the simplest habits like a formal inspection.\
  \ Making his bed? Hospital corners, every time. Adjusting his gloves? Precise, symmetrical, and\
  \ checked twice. If anyone interrupts his process, he sighs dramatically, starts over, and\
  \ mutters, ?Now look what you made me do.?

TECH_TALK.label=Incessant Tech Talk
TECH_TALK.description.0=Barry lives for tech discussions. Whether it?s ?Mech loadouts, engine\
  \ efficiency, or the best way to modify a sensor array, he can talk for hours. He?s not just\
  \ showing off?he genuinely loves the details and wants everyone to appreciate them as much as he\
  \ does.
TECH_TALK.description.1=Tech is logical, reliable?unlike people. Barry fixates on discussing\
  \ systems, specs, and modifications because machines make sense. He buries himself in schematics,\
  \ drowning out the chaos of war with numbers and diagnostics. If he?s talking tech, it means he\
  \ doesn?t have to think about anything else.
TECH_TALK.description.2=Barry?s tech talk is nonstop. Ask a simple question, and you?ll get a\
  \ 30-minute lecture about heat dissipation in fusion engines. His teammates have learned that the\
  \ best way to get him to stop is to nod, pretend they understand, and slowly walk away. But if\
  \ they actually need help? Barry?s the guy who knows everything.

TECHNOPHOBIA.label=Phobia of Technology
TECHNOPHOBIA.description.0=Barry does not trust advanced tech. He?ll use it when necessary, but he\
  \ insists on mechanical backups, manual overrides, and never fully relying on automation. To him,\
  \ the more complex something is, the more ways it can fail?or worse, turn against you.
TECHNOPHOBIA.description.1=Something happened?a system failure, a faulty weapon, or a catastrophic\
  \ mech malfunction that cost lives. Now, Barry avoids unnecessary tech, preferring analog\
  \ solutions whenever possible. Every time he?s forced to use high-tech systems, his hands shake\
  \ just a little.
TECHNOPHOBIA.description.2=Barry hates technology, but in the most comically exaggerated way. He\
  \ glares at auto-locking doors, refuses to use voice-activated systems, and complains that\
  \ ?things were better when they had buttons!? His squadmates joke that he?d be happiest fighting\
  \ with nothing but a wrench and a map.

THESAURUS.label=Uses Obscure Words
THESAURUS.description.0=Barry chooses his words carefully, often pulling from an extensive (and\
  \ oddly specific) vocabulary. He doesn?t say ?wet,? he says sodden. He doesn?t say ?dangerous,?\
  \ he says perilous. It?s not pretentious?he just likes words with precision.
THESAURUS.description.1=His speech is littered with archaic phrases and old war jargon, remnants of\
  \ history books, forgotten dialects, and long-gone mentors. Whether he picked it up from battle\
  \ reports or ghost stories, no one knows?but when Barry speaks, it?s like listening to an old\
  \ soldier from another era.
THESAURUS.description.2=Barry?s vocabulary is so obscure that his teammates sometimes need a\
  \ translator. ?We are in an invidious situation.? What? ?That maneuver was truly\
  \ pulchritudinous.? Excuse me? He insists it?s just how he talks?everyone else insists he?s doing\
  \ it on purpose.

THIRD_PERSON.label=Speaks in Third Person
THIRD_PERSON.description.0=Barry doesn?t just talk?he narrates. ?Barry thinks this is a terrible\
  \ idea.? ?Barry deserves a drink after this.? It started as a joke, but now it?s just how he\
  \ talks. His squadmates groan, but secretly, they?d miss it if he ever stopped.
THIRD_PERSON.description.1=Referring to himself in third person isn?t just a quirk?it?s\
  \ distance. Barry talks about himself like he?s someone else, like his own actions don?t quite\
  \ belong to him. Maybe it helps him cope, maybe it?s just a habit, but when the war gets rough,\
  \ it?s how he keeps himself from breaking.
THIRD_PERSON.description.2=Barry speaks in third person like he?s the star of an epic saga.\
  \ ?Barry will not stand for this injustice!? ?Ah, you doubt Barry?s skills? A grave mistake.?\
  \ It?s hard to tell if he?s serious, but one thing?s for sure?he fully commits to the bit.

TIME_MANAGEMENT.label=Obsessed with Time Management
TIME_MANAGEMENT.description.0=Barry treats time like a resource?one that should never be wasted.\
  \ His schedule is planned down to the minute, and he expects everyone else to be just as\
  \ punctual. If something isn?t optimized, he?ll find a way to make it more efficient.
TIME_MANAGEMENT.description.1=Time is the one thing Barry can control in an unpredictable world. If\
  \ he?s not tracking every second, if he?s not maximizing every moment, things will fall apart. He\
  \ watches the clock, counts the minutes, and runs his life like every delay could be deadly.
TIME_MANAGEMENT.description.2=Barry doesn?t just manage time?he polices it. He reminds teammates\
  \ exactly how long they have left before a mission, times casual conversations, and visibly\
  \ tenses when things don?t start on schedule. "You?ve got 37 seconds to finish that drink before\
  \ we move out." His squad both admires and dreads his sense of timing.

TINKERER.label=Compulsive Tinkerer
TINKERER.description.0=Barry can?t leave things alone. If there?s a machine nearby, he?s tweaking\
  \ it?tightening bolts, adjusting settings, or improving efficiency. He?s not trying to show off;\
  \ he just needs to make things better, even if they weren?t broken to begin with.
TINKERER.description.1=Tinkering is the one thing that keeps Barry?s mind quiet. When everything\
  \ else is chaos, he finds solace in fine-tuning a weapon, recalibrating a ?Mech, or disassembling\
  \ a piece of tech just to put it back together again. If his hands aren?t working, his thoughts\
  \ get too loud.
TINKERER.description.2=Barry absolutely will take apart something just to ?make it better??even if\
  \ no one asked him to. His teammates have learned to check their gear before a mission because\
  \ there?s always a chance he?s ?upgraded? it overnight. Sure, it usually works out, but sometimes\
  \ you really just wanted your comms untouched.

TRUTH_TELLER.label=Habitual Truth-Teller
TRUTH_TELLER.description.0=Barry doesn?t believe in sugarcoating anything. If you ask for his\
  \ opinion, you?re getting it?unfiltered, direct, and sometimes a little too blunt. He?s not\
  \ trying to be rude, but he refuses to waste time with lies or half-truths.
TRUTH_TELLER.description.1=Lies get people killed. Barry has seen too many missions go wrong\
  \ because someone hid the truth, so now he never does. Even when the truth is painful, even when\
  \ it makes things harder, he speaks it?because if he doesn?t, who will?
TRUTH_TELLER.description.2=Barry?s truth-telling is relentless. He will absolutely call someone\
  \ out for bad aim, tell a superior their plan is garbage, or inform a bartender that their drinks\
  \ objectively taste like engine coolant. It?s not malicious?it?s just Barry being Barry, whether\
  \ people like it or not.

UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.label=Unnecessary Caution
UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.description.0=Barry triple-checks everything. He inspects his gear twice before\
  \ every mission, walks through doorways slowly, and treats even minor operations like high-risk\
  \ engagements. Sure, it slows things down?but in his mind, better safe than sorry.
UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.description.1=Barry?s caution isn?t just habit?it?s fear disguised as\
  \ preparation. He?s seen too many ambushes, lost too many people to ?simple? mistakes. Now, every\
  \ action feels like it carries unseen consequences. Even when things seem safe, he can?t bring\
  \ himself to trust them.
UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.description.2=Barry?s extreme caution borders on comical. He won?t drink water\
  \ unless he watched it being poured, refuses to take the first step into a room, and insists on\
  \ redundant safety measures for everything. His teammates joke that he?d wear two parachutes for\
  \ a five-foot drop?Barry doesn?t disagree.

UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.label=Unpredictable Speech
UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.description.0=Barry?s speech patterns never follow a predictable rhythm. He?ll\
  \ start with a deep philosophical musing, abruptly switch to a joke, then suddenly drop a\
  \ completely unrelated fact about ?Mech repair. Conversations with him are never boring?if a bit\
  \ hard to follow.
UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.description.1=His words jump from one idea to another, sometimes mid-sentence,\
  \ as if his mind is processing too much at once. It?s not that he?s incoherent?it?s that he?s\
  \ thinking in layers, skipping ahead while others are still catching up. Sometimes, even he seems\
  \ surprised by what he says next.
UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.description.2=Barry?s unpredictability keeps people on edge. One moment, he?s\
  \ speaking in a perfectly normal tone?the next, he?s whispering conspiratorially or delivering\
  \ dramatic proclamations like an old-world prophet. No one knows if he?s doing it for effect or\
  \ if that?s just how his brain works.

UNUSUAL_HOBBIES.label=Unusual Hobbies
UNUSUAL_HOBBIES.description.0=Despite his tough exterior, Barry has a passion for something\
  \ unexpectedly intricate?maybe he carves miniatures from scrap metal, translates ancient texts\
  \ for fun, or practices traditional calligraphy. No one expects it from him, but he?s weirdly\
  \ good at it.
UNUSUAL_HOBBIES.description.1=Barry?s hobby isn?t just unusual?it?s a lifeline. Whether it?s\
  \ collecting old coins, memorizing obscure battle history, or folding paper cranes from ration\
  \ wrappers, his fixation gives him an escape from the weight of war. It might seem strange, but\
  \ without it, he?s not sure what he?d do.
UNUSUAL_HOBBIES.description.2=Barry?s hobby is just plain odd. Maybe he?s obsessed with perfecting\
  \ the art of stone skipping, maybe he spends hours arranging pebbles into patterns, or maybe he\
  \ has a personal ranking system for every canned food brand in the Inner Sphere. His squadmates \
  don?t understand it?but at this point, they?ve stopped asking.

WATCH.label=Constantly Checking the Time
WATCH.description.0=Barry believes every second matters. He checks his watch, clock, or HUD\
  \ constantly, making sure he?s precisely on schedule. Whether it?s a mission, a meeting, or just\
  \ mealtime, he refuses to be caught even a second off-track.
WATCH.description.1=Time is a reminder of everything Barry can?t control. He checks it over and\
  \ over?tracking how long since his last rest, how much time remains until the next battle, how\
  \ many seconds are slipping away. It?s not just habit?it?s fear of what happens when time runs\
  \ out.
WATCH.description.2=Barry checks the time at bizarre moments?mid-conversation, during tense\
  \ firefights, right before answering a question. No one knows why, and he never explains. It?s\
  \ unclear if he?s timing something important or just messing with people?but either way, it?s\
  \ weirdly effective.

WEATHERMAN.label=Obsessed with Weather
WEATHERMAN.description.0=Barry treats weather like a mission-critical factor. He tracks atmospheric\
  \ conditions, wind speeds, and humidity levels with almost obsessive precision. To him, the\
  \ weather isn?t small talk?it?s intel, and he needs to know how it will affect everything from\
  \ battlefield conditions to how well his ?Mech will run.
WEATHERMAN.description.1=Weather means life or death. Barry has seen storms wipe out supply lines,\
  \ desert heat cripple entire squads, and freezing conditions take more lives than enemy fire.\
  \ Now, he always checks the forecast?because nature is just as much an enemy as any opposing\
  \ force.
WEATHERMAN.description.2=Barry talks about the weather constantly. Not just ?it?s hot today?\
  \ talk?detailed analysis. He?ll debate cloud formations, complain about barometric pressure, and\
  \ absolutely wake someone up at 3 AM to announce an incoming cold front. His squadmates roll\
  \ their eyes, but admit?he?s never been wrong.

WHISTLER.label=Frequent Whistler
WHISTLER.description.0=Barry whistles constantly?a tune stuck in his head, an old marching song, or\
  \ just something aimless. It?s a small sign that, no matter how tense things get, he?s keeping\
  \ his cool. Even in the middle of a firefight, you might hear him whistling like he?s just out\
  \ for a stroll.
WHISTLER.description.1=The whistling isn?t just a habit?it?s a shield. Barry does it when he?s\
  \ tired, when the silence gets too heavy, when the weight of war presses down on him. It?s not\
  \ for anyone else; it?s just a way to remind himself that he?s still here.
WHISTLER.description.2=Barry whistles all the time, and it drives his squadmates insane. During\
  \ briefings? Whistling. On a stealth mission? Whistling?quietly, but still. It?s not that he\
  \ means to be obnoxious?he just genuinely doesn?t realize how much he does it. Until someone\
  \ throws a boot at him.

WORRIER.label=Persistent Worrier
WORRIER.description.0=Barry worries about everything. Is the supply drop on time? Are his teammates\
  \ checking their gear properly? Did someone really secure that hatch? His constant concern can be\
  \ exhausting, but it comes from a place of care?he just wants everyone to be safe.
WORRIER.description.1=Barry?s worrying isn?t just habit?it?s experience. He?s seen too much go\
  \ wrong, and now, he assumes it always will. He double-checks everything, second-guesses plans,\
  \ and lies awake running through worst-case scenarios, because if he doesn?t, who will?
WORRIER.description.2=Barry?s worrying is relentless, but also oddly adorable. He?ll remind\
  \ teammates to drink water, make sure everyone has an exit plan ("just in case") and will\
  \ absolutely stress over whether or not he locked down his ?Mech for the third time. His squad\
  \ teases him, but deep down, they appreciate having someone looking out for them.

WRITER.label=Writes Everything Down
WRITER.description.0=Barry keeps meticulous records of everything. Mission details, supply lists,\
  \ random observations?if it?s worth remembering, it?s getting written down. His notes are\
  \ precise, structured, and borderline military-grade. If anyone forgets something, Barry?s got it\
  \ archived.
WRITER.description.1=Barry writes things down because he?s afraid of forgetting. Names, places,\
  \ decisions?everything he?s seen, everything he?s done. He keeps old journals filled with entries\
  \ he rarely reads, but can?t bring himself to throw away. It?s not just record-keeping?it?s\
  \ holding on.
WRITER.description.2=Barry?s note-taking is excessive. Conversations, overheard jokes, completely\
  \ unnecessary details?his notebooks are filled with a chaotic mix of useful intel and completely\
  \ random facts. Need mission coordinates? He?s got them. Need a list of every time the squad?s CO\
  \ has sighed in frustration? Somehow, he?s got that too.

BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.label=Constantly Reminiscing
BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.description.0=Barry loves telling stories about the old days?whether it?s\
  \ past battles, lost friends, or even just the time he had the best meal of his life on some\
  \ backwater planet. His reminiscing isn?t just about the past; it?s a way to keep those moments\
  \ alive.
BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.description.1=Barry can?t escape the past. He speaks about old missions and\
  \ lost comrades like they just happened yesterday, his mind replaying every decision, every\
  \ mistake. He doesn?t just reminisce?he relives, caught between remembering and regretting.
BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.description.2=Barry?s reminiscing is constant?and sometimes absurd. He?ll\
  \ turn a simple supply run into ?that one time I almost died over a ration bar? and turn a quiet\
  \ moment into ?you kids don?t know real suffering until you?ve had to pilot a ?Mech with a busted\
  \ cooling system in the middle of a desert.? His stories might be exaggerated, but they?re always\
  \ entertaining.

HEAVY_HANDED.label=Heavy-Handed With Equipment
HEAVY_HANDED.description.0=Barry doesn?t mean to be rough?he just doesn?t know his own strength.\
  \ Buttons get mashed, tools get bent, and delicate devices don?t last long in his hands. If\
  \ something breaks? "Well, it probably wasn?t built right in the first place."
HEAVY_HANDED.description.1=Barry has no patience for fragile tech. He forces panels open instead of\
  \ using the right tools, pounds on consoles when they glitch, and tightens bolts a little too\
  \ much. In his mind, if it can?t handle a little brute force, it was never reliable to begin with.
HEAVY_HANDED.description.2=Barry?s squad hates lending him their gear. He grips everything too\
  \ hard, slams every button with intent, and somehow manages to wear out equipment twice as fast\
  \ as anyone else. He insists it?s just ?efficient use of force??everyone else just calls it\
  \ Barry-proofing.

RATION_HOARDER.label=Hoarding Rations
RATION_HOARDER.description.0=Barry believes in always having extra supplies. Tucked away in his\
  \ locker, his ?Mech, and several hidden spots are emergency rations?because you never know when\
  \ supply lines will fail. To him, stockpiling isn?t paranoia?it?s just good planning.
RATION_HOARDER.description.1=Barry doesn?t hoard rations because he wants to?he does it because he\
  \ has to. He?s been through shortages, seen people starve, and knows how quickly things can fall\
  \ apart. Every extra pack he hides is a small reassurance that he won?t go hungry again.
RATION_HOARDER.description.2=Barry has way too many rations stashed away. He doesn?t just hoard\
  \ them?he collects them, ranking different brands, trading for rare flavors, and even keeping\
  \ decades-old MREs ?just in case.? His squad teases him about it, but when the kitchen runs out?\
  \ Guess who suddenly becomes everyone?s best friend.

EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.label=Obsessive Manual Reader
EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.description.0=Barry reads every manual cover to cover?twice. He believes\
  \ understanding every function, limitation, and obscure troubleshooting step gives him an edge.\
  \ While others guess or rely on experience, Barry knows the correct procedure.
EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.description.1=To Barry, manuals aren?t just books?they?re certainty in an\
  \ unpredictable world. They contain rules, instructions, and answers when everything else is\
  \ chaos. He clings to them, rereading sections even when he already knows them, because following\
  \ the book feels safer than trusting instinct.
EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.description.2=Barry doesn?t just read manuals?he quotes them. Expect random\
  \ regulation numbers, obscure maintenance instructions, and way too much detail about procedures\
  \ no one actually follows. His squad has learned never to ask him a simple question, unless they\
  \ want the full technical breakdown.

QUICK_TO_QUIP.label=Quick to Make Jokes Under Fire
QUICK_TO_QUIP.description.0=Barry cracks jokes because he thrives under pressure. A tense standoff?\
  \ "Hey, anyone else feel like we're in a bad action holovid?" Incoming artillery? "Guess they\
  \ didn't like my last joke." His humor isn?t just for show?it keeps morale high and reminds\
  \ everyone to keep moving forward.
QUICK_TO_QUIP.description.1=The more dangerous the situation, the faster Barry?s jokes come. It?s\
  \ not that he finds battle funny?it?s that if he stops joking, the reality of war might actually\
  \ sink in. Humor is his armor, his distraction, his way of pretending that everything isn?t\
  \ falling apart.
QUICK_TO_QUIP.description.2=Barry?s habit of making jokes under fire is equal parts impressive and\
  \ annoying. Squadmates are dodging gunfire while he?s making puns, and during high-stakes\
  \ moments, he?ll throw out completely unnecessary one-liners. It?s infuriating?but damn it; no\
  \ one can deny he?s got perfect comedic timing.

TECH_SKEPTIC.label=Distrusts New Technology
TECH_SKEPTIC.description.0=Barry doesn?t hate new tech?he just doesn?t trust it until it?s\
  \ battle-tested. Fancy new targeting systems? Give him tried-and-true manual controls any day. If\
  \ it hasn?t survived the worst conditions imaginable, he?s not betting his life on it.
TECH_SKEPTIC.description.1=He?s seen too many ?cutting-edge? systems fail when they were needed\
  \ most. Weapons that jammed, engines that overloaded, computers that miscalculated at the worst\
  \ possible moment. Now, Barry treats every new piece of tech like a potential traitor?because\
  \ sometimes, that?s exactly what it is.
TECH_SKEPTIC.description.2=Barry?s dislike of new tech is borderline ridiculous. He?ll argue\
  \ that "things were just built better back in the day," refuse to use auto-calibrating weapons,\
  \ and absolutely grumble about how "back then, they actually had to aim." His squadmates joke\
  \ that he?d replace his NAV-HUD with paper maps if he could.

POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.label=Performs Post-Battle Rituals
POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.description.0=After every fight, Barry follows the same routine?cleaning his\
  \ weapon, checking his ?Mech, writing down key details in a notebook. It?s not just about\
  \ maintenance; it?s his way of resetting his mind, making sure everything is in order before the\
  \ next battle.
POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.description.1=Barry?s post-battle rituals are deeply personal. Maybe he lights\
  \ a small candle for the fallen, whispers the names of those lost, or places a spent shell casing\
  \ in a pouch full of them. The ritual isn?t for luck?it?s a way to hold onto the memories of\
  \ those who didn?t make it.
POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.description.2=Barry?s post-battle routine is strangely specific. He has to\
  \ drink exactly one cup of coffee, spin a wrench in his hand three times, and absolutely has to\
  \ retell the best moment of the fight to whoever is within earshot. No one understands it, but he\
  \ swears by it??You mess with the ritual, and next time, we?re all doomed.?

OVER_COMMUNICATOR.label=Over-Explains in Combat
OVER_COMMUNICATOR.description.0=Barry knows his tactics?but he explains way too much in the middle\
  \ of a firefight. Instead of saying "Flank left!" he launches into "If we move to the left, we?ll\
  \ force them into a crossfire, and statistically speaking, this increases our survival rate by?".\
  \ By the time he?s done, half the squad has already moved.
OVER_COMMUNICATOR.description.1=Under pressure, Barry?s brain doesn?t shut up. He starts breaking\
  \ down every variable, analyzing enemy formations out loud, and explaining why things will go\
  \ wrong instead of just reacting. His squadmates know that if they don?t cut him off, he?ll keep\
  \ talking until the fight is over.
OVER_COMMUNICATOR.description.2=Barry narrates fights like he?s giving a training lecture. "See,\
  \ what they?re doing wrong here is not accounting for recoil drift?OH, would you look at that! I\
  \ told you that shot would miss." His squad yells at him to shut up, but he just can?t help\
  \ himself.

FIELD_MEDIC.label=Tends to Perform Medical Aid
FIELD_MEDIC.description.0=Barry knows his stuff. He patches up wounds, stops bleeding, and\
  \ stabilizes injuries before the medics arrive. To him, knowing basic first aid is just common\
  \ sense?and in the field, it can be the difference between life and death.
FIELD_MEDIC.description.1=Barry learned to patch people up the hard way?because there wasn?t always\
  \ a medic around when it mattered. Every time he ties a bandage or sets a fracture, it?s another\
  \ reminder of the ones he didn?t save. He works fast, methodically, but there?s always a flicker\
  \ of something behind his eyes?too many ghosts, too many regrets.
FIELD_MEDIC.description.2=Barry?s medical aid is unorthodox but weirdly effective. He slaps\
  \ bandages on with a bit too much enthusiasm, makes up medical terms on the fly ("That?s a\
  \ Class-Five Shoulder Bruise") and somehow manages to stop bleeding with spare duct tape. His\
  \ methods may be questionable, but damned if they don?t work.

SYSTEM_CALIBRATOR.label=Constantly Calibrates Systems
SYSTEM_CALIBRATOR.description.0=Barry believes everything runs better when properly calibrated, and\
  \ he refuses to trust a system unless he?s personally checked it. Whether it?s targeting optics,\
  \ heat sinks, or comm frequencies, he?s always making micro-adjustments to ensure peak\
  \ performance.
SYSTEM_CALIBRATOR.description.1=He?s seen systems fail at the worst possible moment?because someone\
  \ didn?t check them. Now, Barry recalibrates constantly, convinced that the moment he stops,\
  \ something critical will break. It?s not about efficiency anymore?it?s about staying alive.
SYSTEM_CALIBRATOR.description.2=Barry tweaks and fine-tunes everything, even when it doesn?t need\
  \ it. His squadmates joke that if they leave him alone too long, he?ll ?optimize? their HUDs into\
  \ complete dysfunction. He insists his adjustments make things better?though sometimes, they?re\
  \ just different.

AMMO_COUNTER.label=Obsessive Ammo Counter
AMMO_COUNTER.description.0=Barry always knows exactly how many rounds he has left. He tracks every\
  \ shot, every reload, and never lets himself get caught empty. To him, ammo discipline isn?t just\
  \ a habit?it?s the difference between life and death.
AMMO_COUNTER.description.1=He?s run dry before. Once. And it nearly got him killed. Now, Barry\
  \ counts his shots compulsively, double-checks magazines even when he knows they?re full, and\
  \ never trusts supply lines to keep him stocked. If he?s low on ammo, he feels exposed?because he\
  \ is.
AMMO_COUNTER.description.2=Barry doesn?t just count his ammo?he counts everyone?s. "You?ve got 12\
  \ rounds left, Hotshot. Make ?em count." He treats it like a game, predicting exactly when people\
  \ need to reload. His squadmates find it either impressively useful or deeply annoying?but they\
  \ can?t deny, he?s never wrong.

BRAVADO.label=Excessive Bravado
BRAVADO.description.0=Barry never backs down from a challenge. He talks big, walks even bigger, and\
  \ makes sure everyone knows he?s the best at what he does. His confidence isn?t just for show -\
  \ it?s how he keeps morale high and makes sure his enemies know they?re already beaten.
BRAVADO.description.1=The louder he boasts, the less people notice the cracks. Barry has to act\
  \ fearless?because if he doesn?t, if he lets doubt creep in, he might fall apart. His bravado\
  \ isn?t just ego?it?s a shield against the war, the fear, and the memories that won?t let go.
BRAVADO.description.2=Barry?s bravado is relentless. He talks like he?s invincible, insists he\
  \ can?t be hit ("They wish they could land a shot on me!"), and bets absurd amounts of money on\
  \ impossible stunts?half of which he somehow pulls off. His squadmates aren?t sure whether to\
  \ admire him or punch him.

COMBAT_SONG.label=Sings in Combat
COMBAT_SONG.description.0=Barry hums or sings quietly under his breath as he fights, an eerie but\
  \ oddly reassuring sound over comms. It?s not about showing off?it?s just how he keeps his nerves\
  \ steady, as if battle is just another performance where he refuses to miss a note.
COMBAT_SONG.description.1=Singing keeps the fear at bay. Barry belts out old war ballads, drinking\
  \ songs, or anything to keep the weight of war from sinking too deep. If he stops singing, if the\
  \ silence creeps in, that?s when the ghosts come?but as long as the music plays, he?s still here.
COMBAT_SONG.description.2=Barry doesn?t just sing?he performs. Full-volume, open-comms, sometimes\
  \ with improvised lyrics about how bad the enemy?s aim is. It?s hilarious, distracting, and\
  \ infuriatingly effective. His squadmates groan, his enemies rage, but somehow, he never stops.

COMMS_TOGGLE.label=Constantly Toggles Comms Channels
COMMS_TOGGLE.description.0=Barry is always switching between comms channels, checking for updates,\
  \ enemy chatter, or the slightest tactical advantage. He?s not just listening?he?s analyzing,\
  \ making sure he never misses critical intel. If someone needs to know something, Barry already\
  \ heard it five seconds ago.
COMMS_TOGGLE.description.1=Silence is dangerous. Barry cycles through comms obsessively, convinced\
  \ that one missed transmission could mean disaster. Friendly channels, enemy signals, emergency\
  \ frequencies?he listens to everything, because if something goes wrong, he refuses to be caught\
  \ off guard again.
COMMS_TOGGLE.description.2=Barry can?t help himself. One second he?s on squad comms, the next he?s\
  \ listening in on command, and sometimes, he accidentally broadcasts to the wrong channel\
  \ mid-joke. His teammates have absolutely heard him muttering to himself on an open channel more\
  \ than once.

EJECTION_READY.label=Paranoid About Ejection Systems
EJECTION_READY.description.0=Barry triple-checks his ejection system before every mission. He runs\
  \ diagnostics, inspects the mechanisms, and even tests the manual release just to be sure. To\
  \ him, an untested ejection seat is just a coffin waiting to happen.
EJECTION_READY.description.1=He?s seen what happens when an ejection system fails. Maybe it was a\
  \ malfunction, maybe it was sabotage, but someone didn?t make it out. Now, Barry doesn?t trust\
  \ them. He modifies his seat, carries extra survival gear, and keeps his hand way too close to\
  \ the trigger?just in case.
EJECTION_READY.description.2=Barry talks about ejection failure way too much. He brings it up at\
  \ meals, mid-mission briefings, even during casual conversations. "Did you know the Stalker's\
  \ cockpit bolts have a 3% failure rate? Just putting that out there." His squadmates don?t\
  \ know if he?s genuinely paranoid or just messing with them?but now they?re worried too.

HAND_SIGNS.label=Uses Elaborate Hand Signals
HAND_SIGNS.description.0=Barry?s hand signals are military-grade?complex, efficient, and highly\
  \ specific. He communicates entire strategies without saying a word, and his squad actually\
  \ understands him. It?s impressive?until he expects everyone to know the full system he\
  \ definitely made up on his own.
HAND_SIGNS.description.1=There were times when speaking meant dying. Barry learned to rely on\
  \ silent gestures, and now, even in situations where it?s unnecessary, he still defaults to them.\
  \ It?s second nature?his way of staying in control, even when words feel too risky.
HAND_SIGNS.description.2=Barry?s hand signals are ridiculous. He insists on using full-body\
  \ gestures, exaggerated motions, and completely unnecessary signals for things like "I need a\
  \ snack." His squadmates have given up trying to decipher them?but Barry swears they?re crystal\
  \ clear.

HATE_FOR_MEKS.label=Harbors a Deep Hatred for Meks
HATE_FOR_MEKS.description.0=Barry hates ?Mechs, but he?ll use them if he has to. He prefers\
  \ infantry tactics, vehicles, or anything that doesn?t put him inside a walking death trap. To\
  \ him, ?Mechs are just big, expensive targets?and he?d rather fight with something reliable.
HATE_FOR_MEKS.description.1=There?s a reason Barry despises ?Mechs. Maybe he lost his squad to one,\
  \ maybe he was nearly crushed by a rogue machine, or maybe he?s just seen too many pilots burn\
  \ alive inside their cockpits. He won?t just refuse to pilot them?he actively enjoys taking them\
  \ down.
HATE_FOR_MEKS.description.2=Barry loathes ?Mechs with a passion that is borderline comical. He?ll\
  \ rant for hours about how they?re impractical, overpriced, and "just an excuse for rich pilots\
  \ to feel important." The irony? He?s really good at fighting them?but that just makes him hate\
  \ them more.

IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.label=Uses Improvised Weaponry
IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.description.0=Barry doesn?t need a standard weapon?he?ll turn anything into a\
  \ tool for combat. A wrench, a broken rifle stock, even a piece of debris becomes deadly in his\
  \ hands. If he?s out of ammo, he?s not out of options.
IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.description.1=There was a time when Barry had nothing?no proper weapons, no\
  \ backup, just his wits and whatever he could scavenge. Now, even when he has full gear, he still\
  \ looks for backup weapons in his surroundings. The lesson stuck: never trust that what?s in your\
  \ hands is all you?ll have.
IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.description.2=Barry prefers unconventional weapons. Give him a frying pan, a\
  \ crowbar, or even a bag of wrenches, and he?ll make it work. His squad has seen him take down\
  \ enemies with absurd things, and at this point, they?ve stopped questioning it. If Barry says\
  \ "Hand me that chair", someone?s about to get hurt.

PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.label=Pre-Battle Superstitions
PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.description.0=Before every fight, Barry follows the same steps?checking\
  \ his gear in a precise order, tapping his ?Mech twice before climbing in, or muttering an old\
  \ pilot?s prayer. It?s not just superstition?it?s a routine that keeps him focused.
PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.description.1=Barry has seen too many battles go wrong, and now he clings\
  \ to his pre-fight rituals like a lifeline. Whether it?s carrying a lucky charm, whispering the\
  \ names of the fallen, or refusing to be the first to step onto the battlefield, he?s convinced\
  \ that one slip could mean disaster.
PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.description.2=Barry?s pre-battle superstitions are borderline ridiculous.\
  \ He must take exactly three sips of water, knock on his ?Mech?s leg twice, and absolutely cannot\
  \ hear the word ?easy? before a mission. His squad jokes about it, but no one dares mess with his\
  \ routine?because, somehow, it works.

SILENT_LEADER.label=Silent Leader
SILENT_LEADER.description.0=Barry doesn?t need to raise his voice or bark orders?when he speaks,\
  \ people listen. His leadership is built on calm authority, precise decisions, and a presence\
  \ that makes others want to follow him. He leads not with words, but with action.
SILENT_LEADER.description.1=He?s seen too much to waste breath on unnecessary words. Barry gives\
  \ only the orders that need to be said, his voice low and measured, carrying the weight of\
  \ experience. He doesn?t inspire with speeches?he inspires by surviving.
SILENT_LEADER.description.2=Barry doesn?t talk much, but somehow, everyone knows what he?s\
  \ thinking. A nod, a glance, a single word at the right moment?it?s all he needs to keep the\
  \ squad moving. His team has developed an almost psychic ability to interpret his expressions,\
  \ and honestly? It works.

BATTLE_CRITIC.label=Constant Battle Critic
BATTLE_CRITIC.description.0=Barry analyzes everything?enemy movements, squad tactics, even his own\
  \ mistakes. He doesn?t criticize to tear people down; he does it to improve. Every battle is a\
  \ lesson, and if you?re fighting with Barry, expect a debrief whether you like it or not.
BATTLE_CRITIC.description.1=He picks apart battles because he has to. Every misstep, every lost\
  \ opportunity, every failure?he replays them over and over, looking for what went wrong. It?s not\
  \ just about strategy; it?s about guilt and the need to make sure history never repeats itself.
BATTLE_CRITIC.description.2=Barry never shuts up about tactics. ?If you?d adjusted your angle by\
  \ two degrees, you?d have landed the shot.? ?I don?t want to say ?I told you so,? but I did\
  \ mention that was a terrible idea.? His squadmates groan, but the worst part? He?s usually right.

CHECKS_WEAPON_SAFETY.label=Constantly Checks Weapon Safety
CHECKS_WEAPON_SAFETY.description.0=Barry treats weapon safety like a religion. He checks the\
  \ safety, reloads, and inspects the barrel constantly, even when he just did it seconds ago. It?s\
  \ not paranoia?it?s good discipline, and he refuses to be the guy whose weapon misfires at the\
  \ wrong time.
CHECKS_WEAPON_SAFETY.description.1=Barry checks his weapon?s safety because he has to. Maybe he?s\
  \ seen an accidental discharge take a life, or maybe his own weapon failed him in a critical\
  \ moment. Now, he checks it obsessively, as if one missed inspection might mean another fatal\
  \ mistake.
CHECKS_WEAPON_SAFETY.description.2=Barry flicks his safety on and off all the time?sometimes\
  \ mid-conversation, sometimes mid-mission briefing. His teammates hear the click and immediately\
  \ know he?s nearby. They?ve tried to get him to stop, but at this point, it?s just part of who he\
  \ is.

CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.label=Prefers Close Combat
CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.description.0=Barry doesn?t believe in long-range duels. He prefers to close the\
  \ gap, using speed and terrain to force his enemies into brutal, inescapable engagements. Whether\
  \ it?s a Hatchetman delivering a crushing blow or a Panther going in for a decisive melee strike,\
  \ Barry?s philosophy is simple: up close, there?s nowhere to run.
CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.description.1=Barry learned the hard way that long-range firepower can be\
  \ unreliable - ammo runs out, heat levels spike, and ECM makes targeting hell. But in close\
  \ combat? Your enemy is right there. He fights at knife-fight ranges because he trusts his fists,\
  \ his blades, and the sheer weight of his ?Mech over any long-distance gamble.
CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.description.2=Barry sees ranged combat as boring?why waste time with PPC volleys\
  \ when you can crash into your enemy? Whether he?s piloting a Berserker or just ramming an enemy\
  \ with a battered Shadow Hawk, he lives for that high-speed, high-risk moment where armor meets\
  \ armor and only one pilot walks away. His lancemates may call him reckless, but Barry just\
  \ grins?"if I can see their cockpit, I know I?ve won."

COMBAT_POET.label=Recites Poetry in Combat
COMBAT_POET.description.0=Barry sees combat as something more than just destruction?it?s art,\
  \ history, and legacy. Whether he?s quoting war sonnets or reciting ancient Terran battle epics,\
  \ he keeps his lancemates steady with words from warriors long past. To him, a well-placed verse\
  \ carries just as much weight as a well-placed Gauss rifle shot.
COMBAT_POET.description.1=Some pilots curse or scream in battle?Barry recites poetry, low and\
  \ steady, like a dirge for the dead. Sometimes it?s lines from a long-forgotten Inner Sphere\
  \ poet, sometimes it?s something only he remembers, whispered over the open comms as lasers cut\
  \ through the air. His enemies don?t know whether to fear his weapons or the chilling certainty\
  \ in his voice as he speaks: "This is the way the war was won, in fire and steel, ?til none left\
  \ run."
COMBAT_POET.description.2=Barry?s poetry choices are downright bizarre. One moment, he?s quoting an\
  \ old Davion war ballad?the next, he?s reciting a limerick about a drunken mercenary from\
  \ Galatea. He fully commits to the bit, reading from a battered old journal between missile\
  \ volleys and making far too many rhymes about how his enemies are about to eat dirt. His\
  \ lancemates groan, his enemies rage, but somehow, he always survives the fight.

CUSTOM_DECALS.label=Obsessed with Custom Decals
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.0=Barry treats his ?Mech?s decals like a warrior?s sigil?an identity on\
  \ the battlefield. Whether it?s a custom unit insignia, a battle-worn motto, or a series of kill\
  \ marks etched into the armor, every mark on his machine tells a story. To him, a ?Mech isn?t\
  \ just a weapon?it?s a legacy, and legacies should be seen.
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.1=Each decal has a meaning?some are for fallen lancemates, others mark\
  \ battles that shouldn?t be forgotten. Barry doesn?t just paint his ?Mech; he records history on\
  \ it, layer by layer. His machine is a walking eulogy, a canvas of victories and losses alike,\
  \ reminding him that war never ends?it just changes shape.
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.2=Barry?s obsession with decals borders on absurd. He?s repainted his\
  \ ?Mech mid-campaign, added kill tallies in dramatic font choices, and once covered an entire\
  \ armor plate with an elaborate battle scene just because it looked cool. His lancemates shake\
  \ their heads, but when they see his Warhammer striding across the battlefield with "You Should\
  \ Have Run" scrawled across the chest, they have to admit?it works.

DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.label=Displays Trophies from Battles
DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.description.0=Barry keeps trophies as marks of victory. A shattered heat sink\
  \ from a downed Atlas, a scorched insignia from a rival unit, or even a battered ?Mech limb\
  \ mounted in his hangar?each one is a reminder of battles won. To him, they aren?t just trophies;\
  \ they?re proof that he?s survived where others didn?t.
DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.description.1=His trophies aren?t about pride?they?re about memory. Every piece\
  \ he keeps?be it a damaged cockpit plate or a torn mercenary patch?represents a fight he can?t\
  \ forget. Maybe it?s guilt, maybe it?s obsession, but to Barry, these relics are more than\
  \ souvenirs. They?re a reminder that every battle has a cost.
DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.description.2=Barry?s trophy collection is borderline ridiculous. He?s got enemy\
  \ unit logos bolted onto his ?Mech?s armor, cockpit panels hung in his quarters, and a Griffin?s\
  \ hand mounted like a hunting trophy. His lancemates joke that one day he?ll show up with an\
  \ entire salvaged cockpit strapped to his back?and honestly, they wouldn?t be surprised.

DO_IT_YOURSELF.label=Obsessive Do-It-Yourselfer
DO_IT_YOURSELF.description.0=Barry doesn?t trust techs to handle his ?Mech the way he wants it. He\
  \ insists on tuning his own actuators, tweaking fire control systems, and personally rerouting\
  \ coolant lines. If something breaks mid-battle, he wants to know he can fix it himself?because\
  \ out in the field, there?s no waiting for a repair crew.
DO_IT_YOURSELF.description.1=In the Periphery, the Inner Sphere, and especially in a long campaign,\
  \ you can?t rely on outside help. Barry learned early that if he wants something done right, he\
  \ has to do it himself. His ?Mech isn?t just a machine?it?s his lifeline, and if he doesn?t\
  \ personally maintain it, it might just get him killed.
DO_IT_YOURSELF.description.2=Barry will not let anyone else touch his ?Mech. He?s rewired half his\
  \ systems in ways no one understands, built a custom targeting HUD with questionable\
  \ modifications, and once spent an entire week replacing armor plates by hand. His techs groan,\
  \ his lancemates shake their heads, but somehow?his machine never fails him.

FIELD_IMPROVISER.label=Improvises with Field Supplies
FIELD_IMPROVISER.description.0=Barry can turn anything into a battlefield solution. Low on coolant?\
  \ He?ll jury-rig a heat sink workaround. Out of ammo? He?s already repurposing explosive charges.\
  \ If there?s a problem, Barry doesn?t complain?he fixes it with whatever?s on hand, no matter how\
  \ unconventional.
FIELD_IMPROVISER.description.1=War doesn?t wait for supply chains. Barry has fought in desperate\
  \ conditions, where scavenging wrecks for spare actuators or rigging armor from salvaged plating\
  \ wasn?t a choice?it was the only option. Now, even when things are stable, he still operates\
  \ like every mission could leave him stranded and bleeding.
FIELD_IMPROVISER.description.2=Barry?s solutions should not work?but they do. He?s somehow patched\
  \ a coolant leak with duct tape, built a working laser mount from spare cockpit parts, and once\
  \ held an entire ?Mech?s leg together with nothing but salvaged cables and sheer stubbornness.\
  \ His lancemates don?t know if he?s a genius or insane?but they do know to let him work.

LOUD_COMMS.label=Uses Loud Comms
LOUD_COMMS.description.0=Barry does not believe in whispering over comms. His orders, warnings, and\
  \ battle calls come through loud and clear?because in the chaos of battle, hesitation gets you\
  \ killed. If he has something to say, his entire lance is going to hear it, whether they like it\
  \ or not.
LOUD_COMMS.description.1=He yells because silence is worse. Too many times, he?s heard static when\
  \ there should?ve been a voice. Too many times, comms have gone dead. So now, Barry keeps his\
  \ channel blazing loud, as if sheer force of will can keep his squad talking, keep them alive.
LOUD_COMMS.description.2=Barry?s comms presence is aggressively loud. He?s the guy who shouts\
  \ ?CHECK YOUR SIX!? at max volume even when no one is nearby. He does not have an indoor voice -\
  \ his only voice setting is battlefield announcer. His lancemates have given up on telling him to\
  \ tone it down, but the enemy? They always know where he is.

WAR_STORIES.label=Overly Fond of War Stories
WAR_STORIES.description.0=Barry has a story for everything. Whether it?s about a brutal urban fight\
  \ on Solaris VII, a botched raid on a Capellan depot, or that one time he barely made it out of\
  \ a failed contract, he?s always ready to recount past battles. He swears his stories are 100%\
  \ true?his lancemates suspect at least 30% embellishment.
WAR_STORIES.description.1=Barry doesn?t tell war stories because he enjoys them?he tells them\
  \ because he can?t stop reliving them. Every mission, every lost comrade, every mistake stays\
  \ with him. The stories pour out whether people want to hear them or not, because if he stops\
  \ telling them, he might start forgetting?and that?s something he refuses to let happen.
WAR_STORIES.description.2=Barry?s war stories are nonstop?and often completely unnecessary. A\
  \ simple supply run will remind him of ?that one time we had to scavenge parts off a wrecked\
  \ Awesome,? and a quiet drink at a bar turns into a two-hour saga about a mech duel that\
  \ definitely got more dramatic with every retelling. His lancemates have learned that once he\
  \ starts, there is no escape.

ALL_OR_NOTHING.label=All or Nothing
ALL_OR_NOTHING.description.0=Barry doesn?t believe in half-measures. If he commits to a fight, he\
  \ commits. When he charges, it?s full throttle. When he fires, it?s everything he?s got. He plays\
  \ the battlefield like a high-stakes poker game?either he?s walking away victorious, or there\
  \ won?t be anything left to salvage.
ALL_OR_NOTHING.description.1=Hesitation kills. Barry has seen what happens when people hold back,\
  \ when they play it safe?they die. He?s not reckless because he wants to be; he?s reckless\
  \ because it?s the only way to make sure the other guy goes down first. If he?s in, he?s all in\
  \ - because anything less is a death sentence.
ALL_OR_NOTHING.description.2=Barry?s battlefield philosophy is go big or don?t bother showing up.\
  \ If he takes a shot, it?s the biggest gun he has. If he rushes an enemy, he slams them full\
  \ force. Subtlety? Never heard of it. His lancemates sometimes wish he?d dial it back, but at\
  \ this point, they know better?Barry doesn?t do restraint.

BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.label=Prefers Ground Tactics
BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.description.0=Barry trusts the terrain more than any flight system. He believes\
  \ real battles are won with positioning, cover, and solid ground beneath your feet. Air support\
  \ is fine, but a good lance with smart movement and fire discipline? That?s what wins wars.
BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.description.1=He?s seen air strikes fail?bombing runs hitting the wrong\
  \ targets, aerospace fighters vanishing mid-dogfight, pilots getting too cocky and leaving ground\
  \ forces to pick up the pieces. Barry fights where he can see the enemy, where he knows the\
  \ battlefield, and where he trusts his ?Mech to carry him home.
BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.description.2=Barry hates relying on anything that isn?t on the ground. VTOLs?\
  \ Overrated. Jump jets? Only if absolutely necessary. He?d rather dig in, use terrain to his\
  \ advantage, and grind down the opposition with good old-fashioned ground tactics. His lancemates\
  \ joke that he?d fight from a foxhole if he could?but the worst part? He probably would.

BRAVERY_BOASTER.label=Boasts About Bravery
BRAVERY_BOASTER.description.0=Barry makes damn sure everyone knows how fearless he is. He tells \
  stories about standing his ground against superior numbers, charging headfirst into enemy fire,\
  \ and personally delivering the killing shot on an Assault ?Mech. His bravado isn?t just for show\
  \ - he truly believes that if you act invincible, you might just become invincible.
BRAVERY_BOASTER.description.1=Barry talks about bravery because if he stops, he might start\
  \ doubting himself. He brags about past heroics, makes light of near-death experiences, and\
  \ insists he never hesitates?because the moment he does, the memories of all the times he was\
  \ afraid might catch up to him.
BRAVERY_BOASTER.description.2=Barry?s boasting is constant?and incredibly specific. ?Yeah, I once\
  \ held off a lance of Heavies with nothing but a busted SRM launcher and sheer audacity.? Whether\
  \ or not any of his stories are true is up for debate, but his squad has long since stopped\
  \ arguing. At this point, they just let him enjoy his own legend.

COCKPIT_DRIFTER.label=Daydreams in Combat
COCKPIT_DRIFTER.description.0=Barry has a bad habit of drifting off mid-fight. One second, he?s\
  \ dodging PPC fire; the next, he?s thinking about the best way to optimize his reactor output.\
  \ Somehow, despite this, he still lands his shots and maneuvers like a pro?much to the\
  \ frustration of his lancemates.
COCKPIT_DRIFTER.description.1=In the middle of battle, Barry sometimes isn?t really there. His\
  \ hands are on the controls, his weapons fire on instinct, but his mind drifts to places he?d\
  \ rather be?a quiet bar, an old battlefield, a past he can?t quite escape. He fights like a\
  \ ghost, like someone who?s been here too many times before.
COCKPIT_DRIFTER.description.2=Barry narrates his own battles like he?s in a holovid, sometimes\
  \ forgetting that he's actually in one. ?Imagine if this was a duel on Solaris VII? no, wait, a\
  \ historical reenactment of the Reunification War?ah, focus, focus!? His squad has had to snap\
  \ him back into reality more than once, usually with a loud warning over comms?or direct incoming\
  \ fire.

CONSPIRACY_THEORIST.label=Believes in Conspiracy Theories
CONSPIRACY_THEORIST.description.0=Barry swears the Great Houses manipulate battle reports, ComStar\
  \ is hiding advanced tech, and the Clans? There?s more going on than they admit. He?s always\
  \ piecing together "the real story," connecting dots that may or may not exist. The problem?\
  \ Sometimes, he?s actually onto something.
CONSPIRACY_THEORIST.description.1=Barry doesn?t trust official channels. He?s seen too many\
  \ unexplained disappearances, too many conveniently lost transmissions, too many salvage teams\
  \ mysteriously wiped out before they could bring back anything valuable. He doesn?t just believe\
  \ in conspiracies?he knows they?re real. The only question is: who?s covering them up?
CONSPIRACY_THEORIST.description.2=Barry will drop conspiracy theories at the worst possible\
  \ moments. "This reminds me of the time I uncovered proof that the Free Worlds League secretly\
  \ funds pirate raids." "Oh yeah, Steiner jump engines? They're artificially limited, you know."\
  \ His squad has learned to tune him out, but every once in a while, he says something that makes\
  \ them wonder if he actually has a point.

DEVOUT_WARRIOR.label=Warrior's Code Devotee
DEVOUT_WARRIOR.description.0=Barry fights with discipline and honor, but that doesn?t mean mercy.\
  \ He follows a strict code?never fire on an ejected pilot, never break a duel, and never dishonor\
  \ his unit. He may not be a Clan warrior, but to him, the battlefield is sacred, and those who\
  \ break the code deserve no respect and no mercy.
DEVOUT_WARRIOR.description.1=War is chaos, and a warrior?s code is the only thing keeping Barry\
  \ from becoming the very thing he fights against. He refuses to fire on an unarmed enemy, won?t\
  \ abandon a crippled lancemate, and always acknowledges a worthy foe. He?s seen too much\
  \ senseless death?this is the only way he can live with himself.
DEVOUT_WARRIOR.description.2=Barry treats combat like a holovid duel?he insists on fair fights,\
  \ challenges worthy enemies formally, and dramatically recites ancient battle oaths before\
  \ engagements. His squadmates roll their eyes every time he bows before a duel, but when he calls\
  \ out an opponent by name and defeats them cleanly, they have to admit?he makes it look damn good.

DUAL_WIELDING.label=Obsessed with Dual Weapons
DUAL_WIELDING.description.0=Barry believes two weapons are always better than one. Twin PPCs for\
  \ long-range devastation, dual AC/10s for a brutal punch, or even paired medium lasers for\
  \ precision work?he swears by symmetry and redundancy. To him, a ?Mech with matched weapons is a\
  \ ?Mech that never leaves a job half-done.
DUAL_WIELDING.description.1=He doesn?t trust single-weapon builds. He?s seen ?Mechs run dry, lose\
  \ their primary weapon, and be helpless. That?s why Barry always runs twins?if one malfunctions,\
  \ the other is still firing. It?s not just preference?it?s survival.
DUAL_WIELDING.description.2=Barry takes his dual-weapon obsession to extremes. Twin gauss rifles?\
  \ Yes. Dual flamers? Absolutely. He once fielded a pair of sawed-off autocannons, just to see if\
  \ it worked. His lancemates joke that if he could, he?d mount two ?Mechs just so he could\
  \ dual-wield those too.

EMBLEM_LOVER.label=Attached to Specific Emblem
EMBLEM_LOVER.description.0=Barry?s emblem isn?t just decoration?it?s identity. Whether it?s an old\
  \ unit insignia, a personal crest, or a relic from his homeworld, he wears it with pride. His\
  \ enemies know who they?re fighting, and his allies know exactly who?s got their back.
EMBLEM_LOVER.description.1=The emblem is all Barry has left from a unit that no longer exists?wiped\
  \ out in a battle that shouldn?t have happened. He keeps it on his ?Mech, his jacket, and\
  \ anywhere else it fits, because as long as it?s there, their memory isn?t gone.
EMBLEM_LOVER.description.2=Barry?s attachment to his emblem is borderline obsessive. He refuses to\
  \ repaint over it, gets personally offended if someone so much as smudges it, and definitely has\
  \ a backup stencil in case it needs retouching. His lancemates joke that if he lost his ?Mech,\
  \ he?d probably weld the emblem onto a new one before installing weapons.

EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.label=Obsessive Debriefer
EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.description.0=Barry does not let a battle end until every mistake, misstep,\
  \ and unexpected variable has been analyzed. Positioning errors? Noted. Heat management issues?\
  \ Logged. Weapon efficiency? Evaluated. He treats every mission like a lesson, because the next\
  \ fight is always coming.
EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.description.1=Barry isn?t just obsessed with debriefs?he needs them. Too many\
  \ pilots have died because they didn?t learn from the last battle. He forces his team to sit\
  \ through exhaustive reviews because if they miss something, if they ignore a mistake, next time\
  \ it could get someone killed.
EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.description.2=Barry?s debriefs are legendarily long-winded. He?ll replay\
  \ battle recordings frame by frame, pause to ask deeply unnecessary questions ("Why did you turn\
  \ left instead of right here?"), and absolutely hand out written summaries. His squad has tried\
  \ to escape them?but Barry always finds them.

EYE_FOR_ART.label=Appreciates Battlefield Scenery
EYE_FOR_ART.description.0=Barry takes a moment?no matter how chaotic the battle?to appreciate the\
  \ view. The way the sun catches the shattered remains of a battlefield, the eerie beauty of a\
  \ ruined city, or the quiet stillness before the next drop. War is ugly, but sometimes, if you\
  \ look closely, there?s something strangely beautiful in it.
EYE_FOR_ART.description.1=After so many years of war, Barry has learned to look for anything that\
  \ reminds him there?s still beauty in the galaxy. A sunrise over a smoking ridgeline, the\
  \ silhouette of ?Mechs against the dust, the way snowfall collects on a burned-out DropShip. He\
  \ doesn?t talk about it, but when he lingers just a second longer before engaging, his squad\
  \ knows: he?s seeing something worth remembering.
EYE_FOR_ART.description.2=Barry will absolutely comment on the scenery mid-fight. "You know, if it\
  \ weren?t for the incoming missile barrage, this would be a really nice valley." "That explosion?\
  \ 10 out of 10. Gorgeous fireball." His squadmates groan, but when you fight every day, why not\
  \ enjoy the view?

FAST_TALKER.label=Talks Very Fast
FAST_TALKER.description.0=Barry processes combat at full speed?and talks just as fast. His battle\
  \ updates come in rapid-fire bursts, cramming three sentences into the time most people take for\
  \ one. His squad appreciates his tactical awareness?if they can actually keep up with what he?s saying.
FAST_TALKER.description.1=The words just don?t stop. Barry speaks quickly because if he slows down,\
  \ if he stops, the silence creeps in?the kind of silence that comes after too many lost battles.\
  \ His fast-talking is a way to outrun his own thoughts, filling the air with words so there?s no\
  \ room for ghosts.
FAST_TALKER.description.2=Barry?s fast-talking never stops, and it?s not just in combat. He?ll\
  \ deliver full mission briefings in one breath, give ?Mech repair advice before anyone asks, and\
  \ absolutely monologue about ?Mech design mid-firefight. His squad has learned to nod and pretend\
  \ they understand?or just wait for him to take a breath.

FINGER_GUNS.label=Uses Finger Guns
FINGER_GUNS.description.0=Barry never misses an opportunity to throw out a finger gun?after a good\
  \ shot, before a fight, even mid-mission briefing. He?s got swagger, and whether he?s locking\
  \ onto a target or just saluting a fellow pilot, he makes it look good.
FINGER_GUNS.description.1=Once, long ago, this was just a joke. A thing he did with a lost friend,\
  \ a reminder of simpler days. Now, even in the middle of war, his fingers still flick out\
  \ automatically, as if echoing a past that refuses to fully fade. Maybe no one else remembers,\
  \ but he does.
FINGER_GUNS.description.2=Barry?s finger guns are constant?at enemies over comms, at techs after a\
  \ tune-up, at teammates after a well-timed missile volley. His squad has stopped questioning it,\
  \ but the moment he mimics recoil after making a shot, someone will threaten to eject him from\
  \ the DropShip.

FLARE_DEPLOYER.label=Excessive NavPoint Use
FLARE_DEPLOYER.description.0=Barry lives by NavPoints. Every waypoint, objective, fallback\
  \ position, and potential ambush site gets a marker. His HUD is constantly full of labeled\
  \ locations, color-coded routes, and way too much data. His squad trusts his navigation?if they\
  \ can actually see through the clutter.
FLARE_DEPLOYER.description.1=Barry has seen too many missions go south because someone ?just knew\
  \ the way.? He marks everything?not because he wants to, but because if he doesn?t, he might miss\
  \ something critical. His comms are full of waypoint pings, his tactical map looks like an\
  \ engineer?s blueprint, and no one gets lost on his watch.
FLARE_DEPLOYER.description.2=Barry drops NavPoints for everything. "Here's the best place to set\
  \ up for a flank." Ping. "This is where I saw a cool rock once." Ping. "Watch out for that\
  \ pothole." Ping. His squad has given up on keeping up with his markers, but one thing?s for\
  \ sure?if Barry marks it, it means something to him.

FRIENDLY_INTERROGATOR.label=Likes to "Interrogate" Teammates
FRIENDLY_INTERROGATOR.description.0=Barry treats every post-mission debrief like an interrogation\
  \ room in a Davion intel office. He fires off questions rapid-fire?"Why did you take cover behind\
  \ that ridge instead of the buildings?" "What was your heat level before you shut down?" "How\
  \ many AC/10 rounds do you have left?exactly?" He?s not trying to grill his squadmates?he just\
  \ needs to know everything so the next fight goes smoother. But after every battle, they brace\
  \ themselves for what they now call "Barry?s Tactical Cross-Examination."
FRIENDLY_INTERROGATOR.description.1=Trust in the Inner Sphere is a dangerous thing. Barry asks a\
  \ lot of questions?not just about the mission, but about everything. "Where'd you learn to pilot\
  \ a Griffin?" "What units were you with before this?" "You ever work with ComStar?" Maybe it?s\
  \ habit, maybe it?s survival instinct, but one thing is clear?Barry doesn?t just trust people. He\
  \ tests them.
FRIENDLY_INTERROGATOR.description.2=Barry loves playing the "interrogator." He shines his ?Mech?s\
  \ floodlights in your cockpit, does dramatic pauses before asking routine questions, and\
  \ absolutely has a running joke where he demands to know if you "work for the Capellans." His\
  \ squad groans every time?but somehow, he never gets tired of it.

GUN_NUT.label=Fascinated by Ancient Firearms
GUN_NUT.description.0=Barry doesn?t just appreciate ancient firearms?he studies them. He knows the\
  \ exact specs of a Terran-era M1911, can break down a Star League-issued Gauss pistol in record\
  \ time, and absolutely owns a collection of pre-Succession War revolvers. To him, these weapons\
  \ are a connection to the warriors who came before, and he treats them with the same respect as\
  \ any ?Mech.
GUN_NUT.description.1=War may evolve, but some things never change. Barry collects ancient firearms\
  \ because they remind him of a time when combat was personal, when warriors looked their enemies\
  \ in the eyes instead of firing LRMs from kilometers away. He keeps a battered old slug-thrower\
  \ in his cockpit?not because he needs it, but because it?s real, unlike the ever-changing\
  \ battlefield of lost tech and political war machines.
GUN_NUT.description.2=Barry?s fascination with ancient firearms is borderline ridiculous. He?s been\
  \ known to lecture his squadmates on the ballistic properties of a 20th-century rifle\
  \ mid-mission, has absolutely tried to jury-rig an old Terran shotgun into his ?Mech?s cockpit,\
  \ and constantly complains about how ?modern sidearms have no soul.? His squad has learned to\
  \ never ask him about his collection?unless they want a two-hour history lesson.

LAST_MAN_STANDING.label=Last Man Standing Mentality
LAST_MAN_STANDING.description.0=Barry doesn?t expect reinforcements. He fights like he?s the only\
  \ one left, because in his mind, he might be. Whether his lance is still standing or down to the\
  \ last ?Mech, he pushes forward, determined to finish the fight. To him, retreat is for people\
  \ with better options.
LAST_MAN_STANDING.description.1=Too many times, Barry has looked around and realized he was the\
  \ only one still breathing. He?s seen squadrons wiped out, units betrayed, and entire battles\
  \ lost?but he?s still here. Now, he assumes every fight will end the same way: with him standing\
  \ alone in the wreckage, looking for what?s left to salvage.
LAST_MAN_STANDING.description.2=Barry has a bad habit of outlasting his team?not because he?s\
  \ careful, but because he refuses to go down. His ?Mech is burning, his ammo is low, and every\
  \ sane person would eject?but not Barry. "If I?m the last man standing, I?m taking as many of\
  \ them with me as I can." His squad jokes that if he ever dies, it?ll be because he ran out of\
  \ things to shoot.

LEGENDARY_MEK.label=Hunts The Black Marauder
LEGENDARY_MEK.description.0=Barry doesn?t just hunt the Black Marauder?he?s obsessed with it. He?s\
  \ tracked rumors, combed through old battle reports, and personally interviewed survivors. Maybe\
  \ it destroyed his unit, maybe it took something irreplaceable, but one thing is certain?he won?t\
  \ stop until that cursed ?Mech is nothing but smoldering scrap.
LEGENDARY_MEK.description.1=The Black Marauder is more than a ?Mech?it?s a ghost, a legend, a\
  \ warning whispered in dark corners of the Inner Sphere. Barry has followed its trail across\
  \ warzones, battlefields, and graveyards, each time arriving just too late. But the more he hunts\
  \ it, the more he wonders?is he chasing it, or is it leading him somewhere?
LEGENDARY_MEK.description.2=Barry will not shut up about the Black Marauder. His squadmates have\
  \ heard every single theory, from ?It?s a Star League experiment gone rogue? to ?It?s piloted by\
  \ a cursed AI?. They joke that it?s just a myth, but Barry knows better?he?s seen the wreckage,\
  \ the silent battlefields left in its wake. And one day? He?s going to find it.

PASSIVE_LEADER.label=Leads Through Passivity
PASSIVE_LEADER.description.0=Barry doesn?t bark orders or push his squad into formation?he lets\
  \ them figure it out. His leadership style is subtle; he makes suggestions, drops observations,\
  \ and waits for his team to make the right decision. When they do, it feels like their choice?but\
  \ in reality, Barry?s been guiding them the whole time.
PASSIVE_LEADER.description.1=Barry has seen too many bad leaders get people killed. He refuses to\
  \ make decisions unless he has to, believing that forcing commands only breeds resentment and\
  \ mistakes. If his team is smart, they?ll figure it out. And if they don?t? Well, that?s on them.\
  \ But when the moment truly demands it, when lives actually hang in the balance? That?s when he\
  \ speaks?and everyone listens.
PASSIVE_LEADER.description.2=Barry technically leads, but you?d never know it. Ask him for orders,\
  \ and he shrugs. ?You do what you think is best.? Need a battle plan? ?Eh, we?ll see how it plays\
  \ out.? Somehow, this actually works?his squad steps up, fills in the gaps, and ends up running\
  \ themselves. Whether this is brilliant strategy or Barry just being incredibly lazy is still up\
  \ for debate.

REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.label=Rebellious Without Cause
REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.description.0=Barry does not take orders well?even when they?re good orders. If\
  \ a commanding officer tells him to advance, he hesitates just to make a point. If a superior\
  \ lays out a plan, Barry immediately looks for ways to do it his way instead. He?s not trying to\
  \ be difficult?he just doesn?t like being told what to do.
REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.description.1=To Barry, orders aren?t just orders?they?re lies, manipulations,\
  \ and death sentences. He?s seen too many leaders throw lives away on bad calls, and now? He\
  \ questions everything. Even when there?s no real reason to resist, he does, because in his\
  \ experience, the moment you blindly follow orders is the moment you get buried under them.
REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.description.2=Barry rebels for the sake of rebelling. If the mission plan says\
  \ go left, he?s going right. If leadership says don?t engage, he?s already firing. He?s not even\
  \ sure why?he just enjoys pushing buttons and seeing what happens. His squad has stopped arguing\
  \ and now just factors in a ?Barry Variable? into every battle plan.

SIMPLE_LIFE.label=Prefers Simple Solutions
SIMPLE_LIFE.description.0=Barry doesn?t believe in overcomplicating things. Fancy tactics,\
  \ multi-layered strategies, and ?clever? battlefield tricks? Waste of time. To him, the best\
  \ solutions are direct?if a base needs taking, storm it. If an enemy ?Mech is a problem, focus\
  \ fire until it?s scrap. In war, simple works.
SIMPLE_LIFE.description.1=War is already complicated enough. Barry has seen entire units wiped out\
  \ because someone got too clever, relying on risky maneuvers when they could?ve just blown the\
  \ enemy apart. He fights with one philosophy?the shortest path to victory is the best one. No\
  \ mind games. No theatrics. Just results.
SIMPLE_LIFE.description.2=Barry?s squad hates how often his ?dumb? solutions actually work. An\
  \ enemy?s dug in? ?What if we just drop a building on them?? Complicated mission briefing? ?Can?t\
  \ we just blow up the objective instead?? Everyone rolls their eyes, but somehow, Barry?s simple,\
  \ brute-force tactics keep getting the job done.

ANTI_AUTHORITY.label=Distrusts Authority
ANTI_AUTHORITY.description.0=Barry doesn?t trust high command. He?ll follow orders?if they make\
  \ sense?but he always assumes there?s something they?re not telling him. Bureaucrats, nobles, and\
  \ generals don?t fight the battles?he does. And if he has to choose between an official order and\
  \ what his gut tells him, he?s always going with his gut.
ANTI_AUTHORITY.description.1=He?s seen too many officers throw lives away for politics, too many\
  \ ?strategic decisions? that left good soldiers rotting in the mud. Barry doesn?t just distrust\
  \ authority?he expects it to betray him. His loyalty isn?t to any House, noble, or command\
  \ structure?it?s to his lance, because at the end of the day, they?re the ones actually bleeding\
  \ for this war.
ANTI_AUTHORITY.description.2=Barry questions every order, every directive, and every so-called\
  \ superior officer. Not because he has a better idea?just because he hates being told what to do.\
  \ "Oh, so now we're trusting intel from the same people who told us last mission would be ?light\
  \ resistance??" His squad has learned that, while his constant skepticism is annoying, it?s also\
  \ saved their asses more than once.

BLOODLUST.label=Thrives in Combat Chaos
BLOODLUST.description.0=Barry comes alive when the battlefield turns to madness. When formations\
  \ break, comms go wild, and the fight turns into a swirling mess of metal and fire, he?s at his\
  \ best. While others panic, he flows with the chaos, making snap decisions that somehow always\
  \ put him in the right place at the right time.
BLOODLUST.description.1=The structured plans, the mission briefings, the orders?they mean nothing\
  \ when the battlefield descends into pure violence. And Barry prefers it that way. In the chaos,\
  \ he doesn?t have to think?he acts, he survives, and he wins. He?s not reckless; he just\
  \ understands that in war, the only real strategy is to outlast the other guy.
BLOODLUST.description.2=Barry treats battlefield chaos like it?s a game. ?Oh no, our left flank\
  \ collapsed? Perfect, more room to maneuver.? He laughs in the middle of missile barrages, taunts\
  \ enemies while dodging fire, and absolutely finds joy in the insanity of combat. His lancemates\
  \ think he?s insane?but somehow, he always makes it out in one piece.

BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.label=Acts Bravely When Doubted
BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.description.0=Barry doesn?t take well to being underestimated. Tell him a target?s\
  \ too well-defended? He?ll find a way in. Say a shot?s impossible? He?s already lining it up.\
  \ It?s not just about courage?it?s about proving that he?s better than anyone gives him credit\
  \ for.
BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.description.1=Doubt doesn?t shake Barry?it fuels him. He?s spent his life being\
  \ told what can?t be done, and every time, he?s made sure to do it anyway. It?s not about pride;\
  \ it?s about survival. If he backs down now, he proves them right?and in the Inner Sphere,\
  \ weakness is just an invitation for someone to bury you.
BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.description.2=Barry only does the crazy, impossible, borderline suicidal things\
  \ when someone says he can?t. ?No way you can take down that Atlas solo.? Boom?Atlas down. ?You\
  \ can?t make that jump with your jump jets offline.? Next thing you know, he?s mid-air. His squad\
  \ has learned to stop telling him what?s impossible?because if they do, he?s absolutely going to\
  \ try it.

CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.label=Obsesses over Melee Combat
CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.description.0=Barry doesn?t just like melee combat?he believes in it. Why waste\
  \ ammo when you can crush an enemy with sheer brute force? He optimizes his ?Mech for\
  \ close-quarters destruction, favoring hatchets, fists, and full-speed charges. To him, a fight\
  \ isn?t real until it?s face-to-face.
CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.description.1=Guns are detached. Lasers, missiles, autocannons?you fire, and an\
  \ enemy dies far away. But in melee? You feel it. You see the damage up close, you know your\
  \ enemy is right there. Barry fights this way because it reminds him that war isn?t just numbers\
  \ - it?s survival, and he refuses to be the one left broken.
CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.description.2=Barry actively seeks out melee fights?even when he definitely\
  \ shouldn?t. He taunts Assault-class pilots into brawling, ignores long-range advantages, and\
  \ absolutely believes in the raw power of a full-speed charge. His squadmates swear he?d try to\
  \ punch a DropShip if he thought he could get away with it.

COOL_UNDER_FIRE.label=Remains Calm Under Fire
COOL_UNDER_FIRE.description.0=Barry doesn?t flinch, no matter what?s happening around him. Incoming\
  \ LRM barrage? He?s already moving to cover. Lance mate panicking? He talks them through it. He\
  \ treats the battlefield like a game of chess?no wasted movement, no hesitation, just cold,\
  \ calculated survival.
COOL_UNDER_FIRE.description.1=He?s seen too much to let fear shake him. He?s watched friends burn\
  \ in their cockpits, walked away from impossible fights, and learned the hard way that panic only\
  \ gets you killed. Barry doesn?t keep his cool because he?s fearless?he does it because he knows\
  \ what happens when you lose control.
COOL_UNDER_FIRE.description.2=Barry stays almost annoyingly calm under fire. "Resistance heavy,\
  \ outnumbered 15 to 1. Under control." He dodges incoming fire casually, makes deadpan jokes\
  \ mid-combat, and absolutely sips his coffee while listening to missile lock warnings. His\
  \ squadmates don?t know if he?s brave or just doesn?t care anymore?but either way, it works.

CRASH_TEST.label=Purposely Tests Equipment Durability
CRASH_TEST.description.0=Barry believes that if you don?t push your ?Mech to its limits, you don?t\
  \ really know what it can do. He?ll stress-test armor by taking hits he could?ve dodged, push\
  \ heat levels way too high, and absolutely slam his ?Mech into obstacles just to see if it holds\
  \ up. His squad calls it reckless?he calls it necessary field research.
CRASH_TEST.description.1=Everything in war breaks eventually. Barry?s philosophy? Better to find\
  \ the weak spots before the enemy does. He runs his machines hard, riding the edge of failure\
  \ just to see where it gives out. He?s not just testing equipment?he?s preparing for the moment\
  \ it fails in the worst possible situation.
CRASH_TEST.description.2=Barry?s obsession with testing durability is borderline ridiculous. He?s\
  \ punched a building just to see how stable it was, intentionally overheated his reactor ?for\
  \ science?, and once ran his ?Mech through a lake at full speed to see if the gyro could handle\
  \ it. His techs hate him, his lancemates question his sanity, but somehow, he keeps walking away\
  \ from it all with more data than anyone ever asked for.

DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.label=Uses Deadpan Humor
DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.description.0=Barry?s delivery is completely flat, no matter how ridiculous the\
  \ situation. ?Oh look, another ?unexpected? ambush. What a shock.? His dry remarks keep the squad\
  \ grounded, cutting through tension with just enough sarcasm to keep everyone focused instead of\
  \ panicked.
DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.description.1=He doesn?t crack jokes to be funny?he does it because if he stops, the\
  \ war gets too real. Whether it?s watching a lance mate eject or seeing a city burn, Barry meets\
  \ tragedy with a monotone, ?Well, that went well.? It?s not that he doesn?t care?it?s that if he\
  \ lets himself feel too much, he might not recover.
DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.description.2=Barry?s squadmates can never tell if he?s joking or not. Enemy\
  \ DropShips incoming? ?I bet they just want to talk.? Outnumbered? ?I love a fair fight.? Even in\
  \ the middle of a battle, his voice stays completely emotionless, making everything ten times\
  \ funnier and way more concerning.

DRILLS.label=Obsessed with Drills and Simulations
DRILLS.description.0=Barry believes victory is built on preparation. He runs drills constantly,\
  \ fine-tuning movement formations, reaction times, and the absolute perfect heat management\
  \ cycle. His squad groans every time he schedules another sim run, but when battle comes? They\
  \ win because of it.
DRILLS.description.1=He?s seen what happens when pilots don?t train hard enough. The wreckage, the\
  \ ejections that come too late, the rookies who never got another chance to learn. Barry pushes\
  \ himself?and his squad?through relentless drills because practice is the only thing standing\
  \ between them and an early grave.
DRILLS.description.2=Barry does not believe in downtime. He will absolutely drag his squad into\
  \ sims after a full day of real combat, analyzing every misstep, running ridiculously specific\
  \ drills (?Alright, what if your left arm actuator jams but your heat sinks are at 67%\
  \ efficiency??). His team has stopped trying to argue?they know Barry?s not sleeping until they\
  \ run the damn drill.

ENEMY_RESPECT.label=Respects Worthy Enemies
ENEMY_RESPECT.description.0=Barry doesn?t just fight to win?he fights to test himself. When an\
  \ enemy pilot shows real skill, he doesn?t just acknowledge it?he relishes the challenge. He?ll\
  \ call out a particularly good shot over comms, nod in approval when an opponent pulls off a\
  \ clever maneuver, and absolutely remembers the names of those who give him a real fight.
ENEMY_RESPECT.description.1=He?s seen too many pilots die pointlessly?victims of incompetence, bad\
  \ luck, or plain slaughter. But those who fight well, who survive against the odds? They matter.\
  \ Barry doesn?t have to like an enemy to respect them?he just has to know they earned their place\
  \ on the battlefield.
ENEMY_RESPECT.description.2=Barry will absolutely compliment an enemy mid-fight. ?Damn good\
  \ shooting. I?ll make sure your cockpit stays intact if I take you down.? His squadmates don?t\
  \ know whether to admire his sportsmanship or yell at him for encouraging the opposition. But to\
  \ Barry, a fight isn?t personal?it?s just about who?s better.

EXTREME_MORNING_PERSON.label=Extremely Morning-Oriented
EXTREME_MORNING_PERSON.description.0=Barry is up before the tech crews, running system diagnostics,\
  \ double-checking loadouts, and getting a full morning briefing before anyone else stumbles into\
  \ the mess hall. To him, the early hours are when real warriors prepare, and if you?re not up at\
  \ dawn, you?re already behind.
EXTREME_MORNING_PERSON.description.1=Years of war have conditioned Barry to wake before the first\
  \ shell hits. He?s seen too many units wiped out in pre-dawn raids, too many ambushes happen\
  \ before anyone?s had coffee. Now, he?s always the first one awake, scanning the horizon, ready\
  \ for the fight that might already be coming.
EXTREME_MORNING_PERSON.description.2=Barry is painfully chipper in the morning. Blasting music in\
  \ the barracks? Check. Drinking his coffee while making sarcastic remarks about everyone else\
  \ dragging themselves out of bed? Absolutely. His squadmates hate it, but Barry swears that ?real\
  \ warriors don?t sleep in.? (That doesn?t stop them from plotting his downfall before noon.)

GALLANT.label=Gallant in Battle
GALLANT.description.0=Barry fights with honor, even in the middle of brutal warfare. He offers\
  \ dueling opponents the chance to stand down, refuses to fire on retreating foes, and absolutely\
  \ protects allies in danger?because to him, a warrior?s legacy isn?t just in who they defeat, but\
  \ how they fight.
GALLANT.description.1=The galaxy doesn?t reward honor?but Barry refuses to abandon it. He fights\
  \ with a self-imposed code, even when it makes things harder, even when it means risking himself\
  \ to save someone who wouldn?t do the same for him. Maybe it?s foolish, maybe it?ll get him\
  \ killed?but if the battlefield turns everyone into monsters, what?s left worth fighting for?
GALLANT.description.2=Barry treats every battle like a dramatic duel from an old Terran epic. He\
  \ formally challenges enemies over comms, gives gracious compliments mid-fight, and absolutely\
  \ refers to his team as ?his noble lance.? His squad groans every time he insists on a ?proper\
  \ duel,? but somehow, it actually works for him.

IRON_STOMACH.label=Can Eat Anything
IRON_STOMACH.description.0=Barry doesn?t complain about any food?nutrient paste, stale ration bars,\
  \ mystery meat from a backwater periphery world. To him, food is fuel, and as long as it keeps\
  \ him in the fight, he?ll eat it without a second thought. His squad is still horrified by what\
  \ he considers ?acceptable? meals.
IRON_STOMACH.description.1=After surviving one too many supply shortages, Barry learned not to be\
  \ picky. He?s eaten things most people wouldn?t even call food, scavenged meals off the\
  \ battlefield, and once made a week?s worth of rations out of a single emergency pack. If it?s\
  \ even remotely edible, Barry will make it work?because hunger is always worse.
IRON_STOMACH.description.2=Barry?s ability to eat anything is borderline legendary. Expired\
  \ rations? ?Still got some crunch.? Fried unknown meat from a Periphery dive bar? ?Tastes like\
  \ chicken.? The squad still talks about the time he drank coolant-purified water on a dare?and\
  \ walked away like nothing happened.

MISSION_CRITIC.label=Hyper-Critical of Mission Plans
MISSION_CRITIC.description.0=Barry doesn?t just review mission plans?he dissects them. If there?s\
  \ a flaw, a weak point, or even a slight inefficiency, he?ll call it out. He?s not trying to be\
  \ difficult?he just expects perfection. His commanders hate his endless nitpicking, but when the\
  \ battle starts, he?s rarely wrong.
MISSION_CRITIC.description.1=Barry assumes every mission plan is flawed?because he?s seen too many\
  \ botched operations led by commanders who never paid the price for their mistakes. He\
  \ double-checks everything, reruns the numbers, and argues until he?s certain the plan won?t get\
  \ his squad killed. If leadership doesn?t like it? That?s their problem.
MISSION_CRITIC.description.2=Barry cannot stop picking apart mission briefings. ?Why are we\
  \ attacking from the west? Why not the north?? ?Who chose this rally point? Do they even know\
  \ what cover is?? He will argue logistics for hours?sometimes just because he enjoys it. His\
  \ squad has learned that if they want a plan to stick, they need to trick Barry into thinking it\
  \ was his idea first.

NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.label=Believes in "No Pain, No Gain"
NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.description.0=Barry doesn?t believe in easy victories. If a mission is too smooth,\
  \ he assumes something went wrong. He trains harder, pushes his ?Mech to the limit, and fully\
  \ expects to walk away from every fight battered but victorious. To him, pain isn?t just part of\
  \ war?it?s proof you?re doing it right.
NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.description.1=Barry?s been through hell, and he knows that suffering builds\
  \ survivors. He doesn?t complain about injuries, doesn?t flinch at pain, and sure as hell doesn?t\
  \ expect things to get easier. He pushes himself past the breaking point because he knows that in\
  \ the Inner Sphere, the moment you stop pushing is the moment you die.
NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.description.2=Barry treats every fight like a personal endurance test. Bruised\
  \ ribs? Fine. Reactor heat spiking? Part of the fun. He absolutely grins when his armor takes a\
  \ hit and definitely refuses medical attention until someone forces him. His squad swears that if\
  \ Barry ever stopped hurting, he?d probably panic.

PERSONAL_ARMORY.label=Keeps a Personal Armory
PERSONAL_ARMORY.description.0=Barry believes in being ready for anything. His personal armory is\
  \ meticulously organized, stocked with small arms, explosives, and even a few ?salvaged? Clan\
  \ weapons. He?s the kind of pilot who has a backup for his backup, and if the situation ever\
  \ calls for firepower outside the cockpit? Barry?s got it covered.
PERSONAL_ARMORY.description.1=The Inner Sphere is unforgiving, and Barry knows better than to rely\
  \ on anyone else for protection. His armory isn?t about firepower?it?s about security. If his\
  \ ?Mech is down, if supply lines fail, if his own people turn on him, he will be ready. His\
  \ lancemates joke that he could outfit a small merc unit on his own?they don?t know how right\
  \ they are.
PERSONAL_ARMORY.description.2=Barry?s personal armory is absurdly overstocked. Need a laser rifle?\
  \ He?s got five. Lost your sidearm? Pick one from the wall. He absolutely names his weapons,\
  \ definitely has a sidearm for every occasion, and once pulled a shotgun out of his cockpit just\
  \ to make a point. His squad isn?t sure if he?s paranoid or just having way too much fun.

QUICK_ADAPTER.label=Adapts Quickly to New Situations
QUICK_ADAPTER.description.0=Barry never sticks rigidly to a plan?he adjusts on the fly. If an\
  \ ambush throws the mission off course, if enemy reinforcements arrive early, if the terrain\
  \ turns against him?he immediately recalculates and finds the best move. To him, the battlefield\
  \ is fluid, and the only ones who survive are those who think fast and move faster.
QUICK_ADAPTER.description.1=Barry learned a long time ago that war doesn?t care about strategy -\
  \ things always go wrong. That?s why he?s stopped clinging to any plan. If the enemy disrupts\
  \ the drop zone? He?ll find a new route. If his ?Mech is damaged? He?ll find a way to make it\
  \ work. He doesn?t adapt because he wants to?he adapts because that?s the only way to stay alive.
QUICK_ADAPTER.description.2=Barry thrives in chaos. Mission went sideways? Perfect, more\
  \ interesting that way. His ability to immediately shift strategies is almost unsettling?as if he\
  \ expects everything to fall apart. His squad has stopped asking how he always manages to land on\
  \ his feet?they just assume it?s some weird magic only Barry understands.

RETALIATOR.label=Seeks Revenge for Any Slight
RETALIATOR.description.0=Barry does not let things slide. You shoot his ?Mech in a live-fire\
  \ exercise? Expect retaliation. You steal his kill in combat? He remembers. He doesn?t rage?he\
  \ calculates. His revenge is cold, measured, and always comes when you least expect it.
RETALIATOR.description.1=In the Inner Sphere, grudges get people killed. Barry knows this, and yet?\
  \ he can?t let things go. A commander who sold him out, a rival who humiliated him, even a petty\
  \ insult?he?ll carry it forever. To him, revenge isn?t about anger?it?s about balance. No matter\
  \ how long it takes, he?ll settle the score.
RETALIATOR.description.2=Barry holds the dumbest grudges. Did someone jokingly say his ?Mech paint\
  \ job looked bad? Now their bunk smells like engine grease. Did a rival pilot beat him in a\
  \ simulated duel? He?s already planning a rematch?preferably in live combat. His squad has\
  \ accepted that Barry?s revenge is inevitable?and always ridiculous.

RUSH_HOUR.label=Enjoys the Heat of Battle
RUSH_HOUR.description.0=Barry doesn?t just survive battle?he thrives in it. The tension, the\
  \ precision, the split-second decisions?it?s where he?s at his absolute best. While others stress\
  \ over the chaos, Barry feels calm, focused, alive. This isn?t just his job?it?s where he belongs.
RUSH_HOUR.description.1=Peace feels wrong. Barry has spent too many years in the cockpit, too many\
  \ days hearing missile lock warnings and feeling the recoil of autocannons. When the fight\
  \ starts, he feels normal?when it ends, he?s just waiting for the next one. War isn?t something\
  \ he enjoys? it?s just all he knows.
RUSH_HOUR.description.2=Barry lives for the fight. LRM barrages incoming? "Now we?re talking!" A\
  \ full lance of Assault ?Mechs engaging? "Hell yeah, let?s dance!" He?s the kind of pilot who\
  \ laughs in the middle of a battle, not because he?s reckless, but because he?s actually having\
  \ fun. His squad finds it concerning, but hey?at least he?s motivated.

SILENT_PROTECTOR.label=Protects Allies Silently
SILENT_PROTECTOR.description.0=Barry doesn?t talk about protecting his squad?he just does it. He\
  \ subtly positions his ?Mech to take a hit meant for someone else, watches radar pings for\
  \ flanking enemies, and always has a backup escape route planned. His allies may not notice right\
  \ away, but when they look back at the battle logs, they realize Barry was covering them the\
  \ entire time.
SILENT_PROTECTOR.description.1=He?s lost too many people to waste time with promises or\
  \ reassurances. Instead, he just makes sure the people around him survive. No speeches, no\
  \ declarations?just a well-placed shot to take pressure off a squadmate, an unspoken act of\
  \ shielding someone when the fight turns bad. Barry doesn?t protect because he wants to?he does\
  \ it because if he doesn?t, no one else will.
SILENT_PROTECTOR.description.2=Barry acts like he doesn?t care, but somehow, he?s always in the\
  \ right place to keep his squadmates alive. When asked about it, he?ll shrug it off\
  \ - ?Coincidence.? - even when he definitely took a Gauss round for someone. His squad has\
  \ stopped questioning it?they just know that when things go south, Barry?s already moving to\
  \ cover them.

ALWAYS_TACTICAL.label=Always Thinking Tactically
ALWAYS_TACTICAL.description.0=Barry never stops analyzing the battlefield. Every movement, every\
  \ engagement, every enemy ?Mech position?he?s constantly adjusting, looking for the next\
  \ advantage. Even in downtime, he?s running mental simulations, thinking about better firing\
  \ angles, more efficient flanking maneuvers, and contingency plans for every scenario.
ALWAYS_TACTICAL.description.1=Barry doesn?t just think tactically?he thinks only tactically. He\
  \ doesn?t get distracted by emotions, doesn?t dwell on losses, and doesn?t care about anything\
  \ that isn?t related to winning the fight. Every conversation, every mission, every moment is\
  \ weighed for battlefield value, because in his mind, the next war is always coming.
ALWAYS_TACTICAL.description.2=Barry thinks way too tactically, even in situations where it?s\
  \ completely unnecessary. Playing poker? He?s tracking everyone?s patterns. Choosing where to sit\
  \ in the mess hall? It?s based on field-of-view and escape routes. His squadmates have stopped\
  \ questioning it, but they?re pretty sure he?s already planned every possible way a mission could\
  \ go wrong?and how he?s going to fix it before anyone notices.

BATTLE_SCREAM.label=Uses a Battle Scream
BATTLE_SCREAM.description.0=Barry?s battle scream isn?t just noise?it?s a weapon. The moment he\
  \ charges, his comms explode with a raw, unrelenting roar, meant to rattle enemy pilots and shake\
  \ their confidence. It?s psychological warfare, and when they hear it, they know Barry is coming\
  \ - and he?s not stopping.
BATTLE_SCREAM.description.1=There?s no thought behind Barry?s battle scream?just pure survival\
  \ instinct. It?s the sound of someone who?s been in too many fights, who?s seen too much death,\
  \ and who refuses to go down quietly. When he roars, it?s because he?s already accepted the worst\
  \ - and if this is his last fight, he?s making sure the enemy remembers his name.
BATTLE_SCREAM.description.2=Barry?s battle scream is legendary. His squad swears it defies comm\
  \ volume limits, and at least one enemy pilot has ejected purely out of shock. It?s not just a\
  \ scream?it?s a full-throttle, no-holds-barred, ?I AM COMING FOR YOU? war cry. His lancemates\
  \ pretend to be annoyed, but deep down, they love it.

BRIEF_AND_TO_THE_POINT.label=Brief and To the Point
BRIEF_AND_TO_THE_POINT.description.0=Barry doesn?t waste words. Mission updates? One sentence.\
  \ Orders? One-word commands. He believes that in the heat of battle, clarity wins fights. No\
  \ speeches, no over-explaining?just the information that matters, exactly when it?s needed.
BRIEF_AND_TO_THE_POINT.description.1=Barry has seen too many people talk when they should have\
  \ acted. He doesn?t do speeches, doesn?t argue, and doesn?t explain himself unless absolutely\
  \ necessary. If you need him to spell things out, you?re already slowing him down.
BRIEF_AND_TO_THE_POINT.description.2=Barry?s squad is constantly frustrated with how little he\
  \ talks. ?Barry, what?s the plan?? ?Kill them.? ?How?s your ?Mech holding up?? ?Fine.? He somehow\
  \ always gets his point across, but his teammates have given up on getting anything more than\
  \ the bare minimum.

CALLSIGN_COLLECTOR.label=Collects Callsigns
CALLSIGN_COLLECTOR.description.0=Barry treats callsigns like battlefield legends. He remembers\
  \ every one he encounters?friend, foe, mercenary, or noble house pilot. He keeps a personal log\
  \ of them, marking their victories, tactics, and fates. To him, a callsign isn?t just a name?it?s\
  \ a record of who you were when the fight started? and whether you made it out.
CALLSIGN_COLLECTOR.description.1=Every callsign Barry collects is a ghost. He doesn?t keep them\
  \ because he wants to?he keeps them because someone has to remember. Fallen allies, bitter\
  \ enemies, pilots who vanished without a trace?he writes them all down. Sometimes, when comms go\
  \ quiet, he reads them back, just to make sure they aren?t forgotten.
CALLSIGN_COLLECTOR.description.2=Barry obsessively tracks every callsign he comes across. He has\
  \ lists, ranks them by coolness factor, and absolutely hands out nicknames to anyone who doesn?t\
  \ have one. His squadmates joke that he?d be a great Solaris commentator, but Barry insists?"A\
  \ name on a battlefield is more than just a name. It?s who you are when the fight begins."

CHATTERBOX.label=Constant Chatterbox
CHATTERBOX.description.0=Barry never stops talking, but at least it?s useful. He calls out enemy\
  \ movements, heat levels, ammo counts, everything. His squad appreciates the intel?when they can\
  \ keep up with it?but sometimes, they just wish he?d take a breath between sentences.
CHATTERBOX.description.1=Silence is dangerous. Silence means someone?s not responding on comms\
  \ anymore. Barry keeps talking, not because he has to, but because it keeps him grounded. War has\
  \ taken too many people around him?so as long as he?s talking, he knows he?s still here.
CHATTERBOX.description.2=Barry will talk about anything?battle tactics, old war stories, the best\
  \ place to get a decent meal on Outreach. He?ll absolutely narrate his own combat actions.\
  \ ?Alright, let?s see if this PPC lands?boom! Direct hit! You see that?? His squadmates have\
  \ tried muting him, but somehow, he always finds a way back on comms.

COMBAT_ARTIST.label=Combat as Art Form
COMBAT_ARTIST.description.0=To Barry, every battle is a masterpiece in motion. Each maneuver, each\
  \ shot, each feint?it?s not just about winning; it?s about execution, flow, and control. He\
  \ fights with the grace of a painter?s brushstroke or a swordsman?s perfect strike, believing\
  \ that true skill is found in how you fight, not just whether you win.
COMBAT_ARTIST.description.1=Barry sees war as the purest expression of existence. Politics, money,\
  \ even survival?they?re just distractions. In battle, all that matters is the moment, the dance\
  \ of steel and fire. Every engagement is a test of skill, a contest of wills, and a chance to\
  \ create something brutal and beautiful before the battlefield turns to ash.
COMBAT_ARTIST.description.2=Barry treats combat like performance art. He talks about ?the rhythm of\
  \ missile volleys?, ?the poetry of a well-executed flanking maneuver?, and absolutely gives names\
  \ to his signature kills. His squadmates roll their eyes, but deep down, they have to admit?Barry\
  \ makes warfare look damn good.

DARING_ESCAPE.label=Specializes in Daring Escapes
DARING_ESCAPE.description.0=Barry doesn?t just escape?he turns it into an art form. Whether it?s\
  \ juking enemy sensors, dodging a kill shot at the last second, or vanishing into terrain like a\
  \ ghost, he makes every exit look effortless. His squad has learned one thing: if Barry says he\
  \ has a way out, trust him?even if it looks insane.
DARING_ESCAPE.description.1=He?s been left behind before. He?s seen escape routes collapse,\
  \ friendly units abandon their own, and pilots die alone in the void. Now? Barry always has a way\
  \ out?and he makes damn sure his squad does too. If the mission turns bad, he doesn?t hesitate -\
  \ because in the Inner Sphere, hesitation gets you killed.
DARING_ESCAPE.description.2=Barry?s escapes shouldn?t work, but they always do. Jumping a crippled\
  \ ?Mech through a collapsing building? Survived. Squeezing a dropship evac through a hailstorm of\
  \ enemy fire? Made it. His squad swears he has some kind of cosmic luck, but Barry just grins -\
  \ "It?s not luck, it?s style."

DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.label=Battlefield Doomsday Prepper
DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.description.0=Barry doesn?t expect battles to go smoothly?he prepares for when\
  \ they don?t. Spare coolant, extra munitions, redundant escape plans, and at least three backup\
  \ NavPoints for every mission. If things go south, Barry already has contingencies in place -\
  \ because in war, expecting disaster means you survive it.
DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.description.1=He?s seen entire units wiped out because they assumed help was\
  \ coming. Barry never assumes. He carries emergency rations, hardwired comm backups, and a\
  \ literal shovel in case he has to dig himself out of wreckage. To him, trusting anything other\
  \ than what you personally control is a fast track to being just another lost name on a casualty\
  \ report.
DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.description.2=Barry?s battlefield prep is borderline ridiculous. Rigged explosive\
  \ escape routes? Check. A stash of hidden supplies buried across multiple worlds? Of course. His\
  \ squad teases him about his ?end of days? mentality, but when supply lines fail, the DropShip\
  \ leaves, and they?re stuck behind enemy lines?suddenly, Barry?s paranoia isn?t so funny anymore.

EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.label=Scavenges for Gear
EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.description.0=Barry treats every battlefield as a resupply opportunity. If a\
  \ ?Mech goes down, he?s already checking what can be salvaged?ammo, armor plating, even a\
  \ half-busted heat sink if it might be useful later. To him, a prepared warrior isn?t the one\
  \ with the best gear?it?s the one who knows how to get more when they need it.
EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.description.1=War has taught Barry one harsh lesson?the only way to keep\
  \ fighting is to take what you can, when you can. He?s looted dead enemies, stripped weapons from\
  \ wrecks, and absolutely fought battles using nothing but what he scrounged the mission before.\
  \ Some might call it dishonorable?Barry calls it necessary.
EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.description.2=Barry will scavenge anything. Lost a laser in the middle of a\
  \ fight? He?ll jury-rig one off a wrecked Locust. Need extra ammo? Give him five minutes and a\
  \ wrench. His squad stopped questioning it after the time he repaired his ?Mech?s arm using\
  \ salvaged parts? mid-battle. If there?s a way to make it work, Barry will find it.

FRIEND_TO_FOES.label=Sympathetic to Enemies
FRIEND_TO_FOES.description.0=Barry doesn?t see his enemies as faceless targets?he sees pilots\
  \ trying to survive, just like him. He knows that today?s enemy could be tomorrow?s ally, and he\
  \ fights with respect, avoiding unnecessary cruelty and offering chances to surrender. After all,\
  \ in the shifting politics of the Inner Sphere, you never know who you might need later.
FRIEND_TO_FOES.description.1=Barry has seen too many pilots die for causes they didn?t choose. He\
  \ knows some of the enemy ?Mechs he?s destroyed were piloted by desperate mercs, conscripted\
  \ soldiers, or people just trying to get home. He still pulls the trigger, but when he looks at\
  \ the wreckage, he wonders if they ever really had a choice.
FRIEND_TO_FOES.description.2=Barry has absolutely had post-battle drinks with people he was\
  \ shooting at just hours earlier. He?ll trash-talk you in combat, but if you fight well? He?ll\
  \ respect you for it. His squad thinks he?s way too friendly with the enemy, but Barry just\
  \ shrugs?"Everyone?s gotta make a living, even the guys shooting at us."

GUNG_HO.label=Gung-Ho Attitude
GUNG_HO.description.0=Barry believes hesitation gets you killed. He doesn?t wait for the perfect\
  \ plan?he moves, fast and hard, trusting his instincts to get the job done. While others\
  \ overthink their positioning, Barry?s already engaging the enemy?because in the chaos of battle,\
  \ the bold strike first and survive.
GUNG_HO.description.1=Barry learned the hard way that war doesn?t wait for you to be ready. He\
  \ fights with relentless energy, not because he wants to, but because pausing means dying. His\
  \ enthusiasm isn?t about bravery?it?s about staying ahead of death itself, and he?d rather go out\
  \ charging than waiting for the inevitable.
GUNG_HO.description.2=Barry treats every battle like a grand adventure. ?Time to earn our\
  \ paychecks, boys!? he yells before rushing into combat, grinning the whole way. He absolutely\
  \ fist-pumps after landing a good shot and definitely shouts ?Let?s gooo!? before charging a\
  \ heavier ?Mech. His squad is equal parts inspired and exhausted by his boundless enthusiasm.

INSPIRATIONAL_POET.label=Recites Inspirational Poems
INSPIRATIONAL_POET.description.0=Barry knows that war is as much about spirit as it is about\
  \ firepower. When the battle gets rough, he drops lines from classic Inner Sphere poetry, old\
  \ war ballads, or even his own compositions over comms. It might seem odd, but somehow, it\
  \ always steadies the team and keeps them focused.
INSPIRATIONAL_POET.description.1=The blood, the wreckage, the screams of reactor breaches?it all\
  \ blends together after a while. Barry recites poetry because it?s the only thing that reminds\
  \ him he?s still human. Maybe it?s an old Terran sonnet, maybe it?s something only he\
  \ remembers, but every verse he speaks is a shield against the madness of war.
INSPIRATIONAL_POET.description.2=Barry has a poem for every situation, and he absolutely recites\
  \ them mid-battle. Missiles incoming? "Rage, rage against the dying of the light!" Squadmate just\
  \ landed a perfect shot? "Oh, to see such glory in fire and steel!" His squad groans, his enemies\
  \ probably think he?s unhinged, but somehow? it just works.

MEK_MATCHMAKER.label=Believes in Mek Compatibility
MEK_MATCHMAKER.description.0=Barry doesn?t just pilot ?Mechs?he forms a bond with them. He believes\
  \ every pilot has a ?Mech that just feels right, and once you find it, you don?t let it go. He\
  \ fine-tunes every system, adjusts every control until it moves like an extension of himself. To\
  \ him, swapping ?Mechs constantly is a mistake?real warriors know their machines inside and out.
MEK_MATCHMAKER.description.1=Barry has fought, bled, and almost died inside his ?Mech more times\
  \ than he can count. It?s not just a machine?it?s his only real ally in war. He talks to it,\
  \ listens to how it moves, knows when something feels wrong before diagnostics even register it.\
  \ Some might call it superstition, but Barry knows better?a ?Mech that doesn?t trust you will\
  \ fail you when you need it most.
MEK_MATCHMAKER.description.2=Barry swears that some ?Mechs just don?t like certain pilots. He\
  \ refuses to ride anything that ?feels off?, and if someone offers him a ?Mech he doesn?t trust,\
  \ he?ll straight-up say "Nah, it?s got bad energy." His squad jokes that he?s dating his ?Mech,\
  \ but Barry just shrugs?"When you find the one, you just know."

MISSILE_JUNKIE.label=Missile Enthusiast
MISSILE_JUNKIE.description.0=Barry swears by the power of missile saturation. He knows the perfect\
  \ range, the optimal spread, and exactly how many LRMs it takes to turn an enemy ?Mech into\
  \ scrap. He?s not just launching volleys randomly?every missile fired is calculated, every\
  \ barrage is a step toward victory.
MISSILE_JUNKIE.description.1=There?s no such thing as too many missiles. Barry has seen battles\
  \ where gunfighters ran dry, where lasers overheated, where only those with stacks of missile\
  \ racks kept fighting. Now, his solution to every problem is simple?if in doubt, fire more\
  \ missiles. He doesn?t believe in precision?he believes in obliteration.
MISSILE_JUNKIE.description.2=Barry?s answer to everything is missiles. His ?Mech is overloaded with\
  \ launchers, he talks about LRMs like they?re his children, and he absolutely names his missile\
  \ racks. "Alright, Betsy and Big Bertha?let?s show ?em how it?s done!" His squad has stopped\
  \ asking why he carries way more ammo than necessary?they know the real answer is "Because I can."

NEVER_RETREAT.label=Hates to Retreat
NEVER_RETREAT.description.0=Barry sees retreat as a failure of strategy. If the battle is turning,\
  \ it means someone made a mistake, and he?d rather fix the problem than abandon the field. He?s\
  \ the last one to pull back, often covering his squad?s retreat?if he even agrees to it at all.
NEVER_RETREAT.description.1=He?s lost too much ground, too many friends, and too many battles to\
  \ ever accept retreat as an option. He doesn?t run?he grinds forward, no matter the cost. If he?s\
  \ forced to withdraw, he takes it personally, because in his mind, every step backward is a step\
  \ toward the grave.
NEVER_RETREAT.description.2=Barry flat-out refuses to retreat, sometimes just out of principle.\
  \ ?Outnumbered? Good. Now it?s a fair fight.? His squad has dragged him out of battles he refused\
  \ to leave, and he absolutely talks about those moments like he was robbed of a perfectly good\
  \ last stand.

OPTIMISTIC_TO_A_FAULT.label=Optimistic to a Fault
OPTIMISTIC_TO_A_FAULT.description.0=Barry always believes there?s a way to win. Even when\
  \ outgunned, outnumbered, and running low on ammo, he refuses to acknowledge defeat as an option.\
  \ He keeps his squad focused by pointing out every opportunity, no matter how slim?because in\
  \ war, belief can be as powerful as firepower.
OPTIMISTIC_TO_A_FAULT.description.1=He?s seen too many pilots break under the weight of war, and he\
  \ refuses to be one of them. Barry will always tell his squad, ?We?re gonna make it out of this.?\
  \ Even when the situation is completely hopeless, even when the odds are laughable, he clings to\
  \ optimism because the moment he admits the truth, it becomes real.
OPTIMISTIC_TO_A_FAULT.description.2=Barry?s optimism is borderline ridiculous. Surrounded by three\
  \ lances of Assault ?Mechs? ?Perfect, more salvage for us.? Jump jets failing mid-air? ?Guess\
  \ I?ll land dramatically.? His squad has long since stopped arguing with his delusional\
  \ confidence?because somehow, against all logic, it actually works for him.

REACTIVE.label=Highly Reactive
REACTIVE.description.0=Barry reads every social cue like it?s battlefield data. A squadmate shifts\
  \ awkwardly? He knows something?s wrong. A commander hesitates before giving an order? He?s\
  \ already questioning their confidence. He reacts instantly to changes in tone, body language,\
  \ and expressions?sometimes before the person themselves realizes they?re feeling something. It\
  \ makes him a great strategist but an exhausting person to talk to.
REACTIVE.description.1=Years of war have rewired Barry?s brain to constantly scan for threats?even\
  \ in conversation. A change in vocal pitch, a subtle glance, a slight hesitation in speech? It\
  \ means something. He can?t turn it off, and he doesn?t trust people who think words don?t\
  \ matter. To him, every interaction is a tactical exchange, and if you?re hiding something, he?ll\
  \ know.
REACTIVE.description.2=Barry reacts to everything?a joke, a sigh, a slight shift in tone?as if it?s\
  \ a major event. Someone raises an eyebrow? ?What was that? You disagree?? A casual remark? ?Oh,\
  \ we?re doing sarcasm now?? He absolutely takes social cues way too seriously, sometimes\
  \ derailing entire conversations because he has to respond to everything. His squad has learned\
  \ to ignore his overreactions?but Barry? He?s watching.

RISK_TAKER.label=Extreme Risk Taker
RISK_TAKER.description.0=Barry isn?t reckless?he just sees opportunities others don?t. When his\
  \ squad hesitates, he?s already moving. He thrives on high-risk, high-reward plays?taking the\
  \ risky flank, sprinting straight through enemy fire, or fighting a heavier ?Mech at knife-fight\
  \ range. Others call it dangerous?Barry calls it the fastest route to victory.
RISK_TAKER.description.1=Barry doesn?t take risks because he wants to?he takes them because he has\
  \ nothing to lose. He?s watched careful, cautious pilots die just the same as reckless ones, so\
  \ he figures why hesitate? If the choice is between a slow death or a fast gamble, he?ll always\
  \ bet on himself?even if it means one day, the odds catch up.
RISK_TAKER.description.2=Barry doesn?t take risks because he wants to?he takes them because he has\
  \ nothing to lose. He?s watched careful, cautious pilots die just the same as reckless ones, so\
  \ he figures why hesitate? If the choice is between a slow death or a fast gamble, he?ll always\
  \ bet on himself?even if it means one day, the odds catch up.

SIGNATURE_MOVE.label=Has a Signature Move
SIGNATURE_MOVE.description.0=Barry?s signature move isn?t just flashy?it?s effective. Whether it?s\
  \ a perfectly timed alpha strike, a flawless DFA, or a devastating side-step and counterfire,\
  he?s honed it to perfection. Enemies who?ve fought him before know it?s coming?but that doesn?t\
  \ mean they can stop it.
SIGNATURE_MOVE.description.1=Barry didn?t create his signature move?it created itself, forged\
  \ through desperate survival and battlefield necessity. Maybe it?s a last-second drop-and-roll to\
  \ dodge a Gauss slug, a perfectly placed reactor-overheat bait, or a brutal melee finisher that?s\
  \ left wreckage in its wake. It?s not just his move?it?s the reason he?s still alive.
SIGNATURE_MOVE.description.2=Barry?s signature move is somehow both absurd and terrifyingly\
  \ effective. Maybe it?s jumping over enemies while flipping them off, ramming into ?Mechs just\
  \ because he can, or firing his weapons in a wildly unnecessary but stylish sequence. His squad\
  \ groans every time he does it, but the worst part? It actually works.

TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.label=Strategically Withdraws
TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.description.0=Barry doesn?t see withdrawal as defeat?he sees it as a\
  \ repositioning opportunity. If a fight isn?t going in his favor, he?s already scanning for the\
  \ best fallback point, knowing that a retreat today means a victory tomorrow. He doesn?t run?he\
  \ maneuvers to win on his terms.
TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.description.1=Barry has seen too many pilots die because they refused to pull\
  \ back. He?s not a coward?he?s a survivor. He knows when to fight and when staying means getting\
  \ buried in the wreckage. His enemies might call him a runner, but he?s still breathing?and he?ll\
  \ be the one hunting them down next time.
TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.description.2=Barry has perfected the ?strategic withdrawal.? ?This isn?t\
  \ running, it?s just re-engaging later.? He absolutely talks about retreating like it?s all part\
  \ of the plan, often with dramatic flair. His squad used to roll their eyes?until they realized\
  \ he always comes back with a fresh angle and a bigger problem for the enemy.

ACCENT_SWITCHER.label=Switches Accents Randomly
ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.0=Barry?s accent-shifting throws everyone off?including his enemies.\
  \ One second, he?s barking orders in a clipped, professional Lyran tone; the next, he?s drawling\
  \ like a Davion farmhand. He insists it?s a psychological tactic, keeping people off-balance.\
  \ Whether it actually works or not? Depends on how annoyed his squad is that day.
ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.1=Barry has been too many places, worn too many masks, fought for too\
  \ many banners. He doesn?t even know if his real accent still exists. One moment, he sounds like\
  \ a hardened Kuritan warrior, the next, a smooth-talking Canopian. It?s not just a quirk?it?s\
  \ who he?s had to become to survive.
ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.2=Barry?s accent game is absolutely out of control. He takes bets on\
  \ how long he can keep one going, sometimes swaps mid-sentence, and absolutely once convinced an\
  \ entire merc unit that he was from a noble house just by talking like a snooty Marik officer.\
  \ His squad has given up trying to understand?now they just roll with it.

AMBUSH_LOVER.label=Ambush Specialist
AMBUSH_LOVER.description.0=Barry doesn?t just set up ambushes?he engineers them. He calculates\
  \ enemy movement patterns, predicts their exact hesitation points, and places his lance where\
  \ they?ll do the most damage. When his squad strikes, the enemy is already dead?they just don?t\
  \ know it yet.
AMBUSH_LOVER.description.1=There?s no such thing as a fair fight. Barry has learned that battles\
  \ aren?t won by who shoots first, but by who isn?t seen until it?s too late. He fights like a\
  \ ghost, setting brutal kill zones, disabling enemy movement, and striking only when the enemy\
  \ has nowhere left to run. If they even realize they were being hunted, he considers it a\
  \ failure.
AMBUSH_LOVER.description.2=Barry treats ambushing enemies like it?s a game. "Bet you five beers\
  \ they come down the left ridge." They do. "Watch this?I?m gonna ruin their whole day." He does.\
  \ His squad doesn?t know if he?s psychic or just disturbingly good at predicting enemy stupidity,\
  \ but either way, they?ve learned to listen when Barry says, ?Wait here. This?ll be fun.?

BATTLE_HARDENED.label=Battle-Hardened Stoic
BATTLE_HARDENED.description.0=Barry doesn?t flinch, doesn?t panic, and never wastes words. Whether\
  \ he?s under heavy fire, watching a friendly ?Mech go critical, or walking out of a losing fight,\
  \ his expression never changes. He keeps his squad steady because he is steady?a rock in the\
  \ chaos of war, unmoved by anything but the next mission.
BATTLE_HARDENED.description.1=There was a time when Barry felt things. But after enough battles,\
  \ enough friends lost, enough explosions too close to the cockpit, he?s learned that emotion\
  \ doesn?t belong on the battlefield. He fights, he survives, and he keeps moving forward?because\
  \ if he stops to feel, he might never start again.
BATTLE_HARDENED.description.2=Barry?s squad has never seen him react. Ever. An AC/20 round barely\
  \ misses his cockpit? Barely a blink. His ?Mech loses a leg mid-battle? Flat monotone: "I can\
  \ make it work." He never raises his voice, never loses his cool, and definitely once took a\
  \ direct missile hit and kept drinking his coffee.

BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.label=Breaks Radio Silence
BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.0=Barry hates sitting in silence when he knows there?s important\
  \ intel to share. If the plan is going sideways, if he spots an unseen flanker, if he thinks\
  \ command is missing something, he?s going to speak up?radio silence or not. His squad complains,\
  \ but they never ignore what he says.
BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.1=There?s something about dead air that makes Barry?s skin crawl.\
  \ Maybe it?s because he?s waited too many times for voices that never came back. Maybe it?s\
  \ because silence in war usually means something terrible just happened. Either way, he has to\
  \ break it, even if it?s just to say ?Still here.?
BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.2=Barry cannot keep quiet, even in stealth ops. He?ll whisper a\
  \ joke, hum a tune, or just say ?I know we?re supposed to be silent, but?? before someone muting\
  \ him out of sheer frustration. His squad has accepted that if Barry goes too long without\
  \ talking, he?s probably about to explode.

CONVOY_LOVER.label=Prefers Convoy Missions
CONVOY_LOVER.description.0=Barry sees convoy missions as the ultimate test of discipline. Holding a\
  \ defensive perimeter, coordinating movements, knowing exactly when to engage and when to hold\
  \ fire?that?s real skill. He takes pride in ensuring every last transport makes it through,\
  \ because to him, an escort mission done right is more impressive than any battlefield brawl.
CONVOY_LOVER.description.1=Barry has seen too many pilots obsessed with the kill count and forget\
  \ why they fight in the first place. Convoy missions? That?s what war should be about. Not just\
  \ destroying, but protecting?making sure people, supplies, and entire futures make it to where\
  \ they need to go. For him, keeping a convoy alive isn?t just a job?it?s a responsibility.
CONVOY_LOVER.description.2=Barry treats convoy missions like a high-speed chess match. ?Alright,\
  \ we?ve got a slow mover in the back, we adjust the pace. Strikers on the ridge?yeah, I see you,\
  \ don?t even try it.? He loves the coordination, the strategy, and absolutely gets way too\
  \ excited when pulling off a perfect escort. His squad doesn?t get why he enjoys them so much,\
  \ but hey?as long as the trucks don?t explode, he?s happy.

DEBRIS_SLINGER.label=Uses Debris as Weapons
DEBRIS_SLINGER.description.0=Barry doesn?t see debris as waste?he sees it as opportunity. A fallen\
  \ building? Cover and concealment. A broken ?Mech limb? Makes for a solid blunt instrument. If he\
  \ runs out of ammo, that doesn?t mean he?s out of options?it just means he?s about to get\
  \ creative.
DEBRIS_SLINGER.description.1=He?s fought in too many battles where supply lines failed,\
  \ reinforcements never came, and ammo ran dry. When that happens, you use what?s left. Barry has\
  \ bludgeoned ?Mechs with wreckage, tipped over fuel trucks to create firestorms, and once kicked\
  \ a fallen ?Mech?s PPC straight into another unit?s cockpit. War isn?t about having the best\
  \ weapons?it?s about making do with whatever?s left.
DEBRIS_SLINGER.description.2=Barry?s philosophy? ?If you can throw it, it?s a weapon.? He?s\
  \ absolutely used ?Mech wreckage as projectile cover, definitely grabbed broken armor plating to\
  \ block incoming fire, and at least once threw a burning wreckage chunk at a fleeing opponent\
  \ just because he could. His squad gave up asking why?they just accept that Barry will always\
  \ find something to throw at the enemy.

CAMOUFLAGE.label=Likes to Camouflage Equipment
CAMOUFLAGE.description.0=Barry knows that a ?Mech you don?t see is a ?Mech you don?t shoot. He\
  \ carefully adjusts paint schemes, adds terrain-adaptive coatings, and even modifies sensor\
  \ signatures to blend into the battlefield. He doesn?t just fight?he vanishes, striking only when\
  \ the enemy has already lost him in the landscape.
CAMOUFLAGE.description.1=War has taught Barry one thing?if they can?t find you, they can?t kill\
  \ you. He?s covered his cockpit in non-reflective coatings, tweaked thermal baffles to mask heat\
  \ signatures, and even smeared mud on his armor when necessary. He doesn?t care if it looks\
  \ pretty?he only cares if it keeps him alive.
CAMOUFLAGE.description.2=Barry takes camo way too seriously. Jungle op? Green paint and foliage\
  \ strapped to the chassis. Urban fight? Gray primer and dust to blend in. He once painted his\
  \ entire ?Mech white for a snowy battlefield? only to be deployed in a desert. His squad thinks\
  \ he goes overboard, but Barry just grins??They?ll never see me coming.?

DISTANT_LEADER.label=Leads from a Distance
DISTANT_LEADER.description.0=Barry doesn?t need to be in the thick of the fight to lead?he commands\
  \ best when he has the full battlefield in view. From a sniper?s perch or a secure position, he\
  \ coordinates movements, calls targets, and ensures his team executes the mission with precision.\
  \ Some call it detached, but Barry knows that a leader who sees the whole picture wins the war.
DISTANT_LEADER.description.1=Barry used to fight up close. He used to be right there, in the line\
  \ of fire. But after too many losses, he started pulling back. It?s easier to command when you?re\
  \ not watching friends die in front of you. It?s easier to make the hard calls when you?re not\
  \ the one covered in their wreckage. Leading from a distance isn?t cowardice?it?s the only way he\
  \ can still do it.
DISTANT_LEADER.description.2=Barry?s squad has gotten used to hearing orders from far away. While\
  \ they?re dodging missiles and slugging it out in the brawl, Barry?s sitting back at just the\
  \ right range, popping shots and giving directions. ?No, no, you?ve got them?keep them distracted\
  \ while I line up this perfect shot.? His squadmates joke that he?d rather watch than fight, but\
  \ somehow, he always keeps them alive.

DRAMATIC_FINISH.label=Prefers Dramatic Finishes
DRAMATIC_FINISH.description.0=Barry believes a fight should end with impact. If he?s taking down a\
  \ ?Mech, he?s lining up the perfect shot, making sure it goes down hard and visibly. Maybe it?s a\
  \ well-timed cockpit kill, a precision strike that sets off a reactor explosion, or a final melee\
  \ attack that leaves no doubt who won. He fights smart?but he finishes with style.
DRAMATIC_FINISH.description.1=To Barry, a fight isn?t just about winning?it?s about sending a\
  \ message. He doesn?t do clean kills or subtle takedowns?he ends battles in a way that makes sure\
  \ no one forgets them. A burning wreck left in the center of the battlefield, an enemy command\
  \ unit brought down in full view of their allies?his victories aren?t just tactical, they?re\
  \ psychological warfare.
DRAMATIC_FINISH.description.2=Barry absolutely makes sure his final hits are as flashy as possible.\
  \ He?ll time a PPC shot with an explosion, finish a melee fight with a slow, exaggerated stomp,\
  \ or shove a crippled ?Mech off a cliff just for effect. His squad thinks he tries way too hard,\
  \ but Barry insists??Why just win when you can make it unforgettable??

ENGINE_REVERER.label=Reveres Fusion Engines
ENGINE_REVERER.description.0=Barry doesn?t just trust fusion engines?he respects them. To him,\
  \ they?re the heart of every ?Mech, the reason battlefields are dominated by walking war machines\
  \ instead of tanks. He knows every make and model, down to the optimal cooling ratios, and he?ll\
  \ remind you that without fusion power, the Inner Sphere would be stuck in the mud.
ENGINE_REVERER.description.1=In a galaxy where technology is dying, Barry sees fusion engines as\
  \ sacred relics of a greater past. They are the last true remnants of Star League greatness, the\
  \ lifeblood of the battlefield, and without them, war itself would grind to a halt. He doesn?t\
  \ just maintain his fusion core?he honors it, knowing that as long as it burns, so does he.
ENGINE_REVERER.description.2=Barry talks about fusion engines like they?re gods. He pats his\
  \ reactor casing for good luck before every fight, lectures anyone who complains about heat\
  \ buildup, and absolutely has names for his favorite engine models. His squad has learned never\
  \ to badmouth fusion tech around him?unless they want a three-hour sermon on why ICE engines are\
  \ blasphemy.

FLIRTY_COMMS.label=Flirts Over Comms
FLIRTY_COMMS.description.0=Barry?s radio chatter is just as sharp as his aim. Between target\
  \ callouts and tactical updates, he drops effortless one-liners at allies and enemies alike.\
  \ "Nice shooting, Kuritan. You free after this war?" His squad rolls their eyes, but somehow,\
  \ he never loses his focus?even when turning the charm up to full power.
FLIRTY_COMMS.description.1=War is ugly, and Barry knows it all too well?so he keeps things light.\
  \ His flirtatious banter isn?t just about fun?it?s about distracting from the hell around him. A\
  \ playful comment over comms, a casual compliment mid-battle, all to remind himself and everyone\
  \ else that they?re still human. It?s a fragile kind of defiance?because if you stop smiling, the\
  \ war wins.
FLIRTY_COMMS.description.2=Barry flirts constantly over comms, regardless of the situation. "You\
  \ know, for a lance trying to kill me, you all have really nice voices." He absolutely has a\
  \ reputation for it, and at least one enemy pilot has paused mid-combat just to process what he\
  \ just said. His squad has given up trying to stop him?if anything, they just bet on how long it\
  \ takes for someone to flirt back.

FOCUS_FREAK.label=Hyper-Focused Under Pressure
FOCUS_FREAK.description.0=When things start falling apart, Barry sharpens. Incoming missile\
  \ barrage? He?s already adjusting his vector. Enemy reinforcements arriving? He?s calculating the\
  \ best firing solution. He doesn?t panic, doesn?t hesitate?he locks in, shutting out everything\
  \ but the mission, the target, and the next move.
FOCUS_FREAK.description.1=Barry has been in too many bad situations to let fear slow him down. The\
  \ more the battle spirals out of control, the calmer he becomes. He?s watched too many pilots\
  \ freeze, choke, or hesitate?and every single one of them ended up wreckage in the dirt. He\
  \ refuses to be next, so when the pressure mounts, he becomes something cold, something\
  \ unshakable?something that survives.
FOCUS_FREAK.description.2=Barry zones in so hard under pressure that it?s downright unsettling.\
  \ Explosions, alarms, shouting?none of it registers. He?s calculating trajectories, tracking\
  \ movement patterns, landing pinpoint shots like nothing else exists. His squad has tested this\
  \ by throwing random distractions at him mid-fight?he never even blinks.

FOUL_MOUTHED.label=Foul-Mouthed in Combat
FOUL_MOUTHED.description.0=Barry?s comms are a steady stream of expletives, but somehow, they?re\
  \ still useful. ?That?s a fing Catapult on the ridge?cut off its fing line of sight!? His squad\
  \ has long since tuned out the profanity, but his enemies? They know exactly how pissed off he is\
  \ when the swearing hits full-auto.
FOUL_MOUTHED.description.1=Barry has fought too many battles to keep his mouth clean. Every shot,\
  \ every impact, every moment of chaos is punctuated with some kind of expletive-laden reaction.\
  \ He?s not trying to be funny?it?s just the only way he can process the sheer insanity of combat.\
  \ If you don?t like it? Too bad.
FOUL_MOUTHED.description.2=Barry doesn?t just swear?he weaponizes profanity. He insults enemy\
  \ ?Mechs, trash-talks entire lances, and definitely once made a pirate commander rage-quit just\
  \ from sheer verbal abuse. His squad has given up trying to clean up his language, but at this\
  \ point, they?re taking notes for future use.

FREESTYLE_COMBAT.label=Uses Freestyle Combat Tactics
FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.0=Barry never follows a set battle plan?he adapts in real time,\
  \ shifting strategies as the fight unfolds. His movements are erratic, his attack angles\
  \ unexpected, and his tactics impossible to predict. His squadmates have learned to just roll\
  \ with it because somehow, his improvisation always finds a way to work.
FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.1=War isn?t clean?plans fail, orders get lost, and careful strategies\
  \ get buried in the mud. Barry fights on instinct, not doctrine. He moves where the enemy doesn?t\
  \ expect, strikes when they least anticipate, and never fights the same way twice. He?s survived\
  \ this long because rules get people killed?reacting keeps you alive.
FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.2=Barry fights like he?s making it up as he goes?because he is.\
  \ Charging a heavier ?Mech with no ammo? Why not? Jump-jetting off a burning building mid-fight?\
  \ Sounds fun. His squad has given up trying to predict his moves?but the worst part? It keeps\
  \ working. No one?not even Barry?knows what he?s going to do next.

GEOMETRY_GURU.label=Calculates Firing Angles
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.0=Barry doesn?t just shoot?he calculates every shot. Trajectory, armor\
  \ thickness, ricochet potential?he does the math before pulling the trigger. His squad knows that\
  \ if Barry takes the shot, it?s hitting exactly where he wants it to, because he?s already\
  \ planned for the outcome before they even see the target.
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.1=Every shot has to count. Barry?s seen too many pilots run out of ammo,\
  \ miss critical shots, or die because they didn?t plan ahead. He?s learned to think three steps\
  \ ahead?to know where his rounds will land before he even pulls the trigger. In war, careless\
  \ fire is just wasted survival chances, and Barry refuses to waste anything.
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.2=Barry treats every shot like a science experiment. He?ll bounce machine\
  \ gun shots off a downed ?Mech, thread an AC/10 round through collapsing rubble, and once took\
  \ out a fleeing pilot by banking a missile off a DropShip?s landing gear. His squad doesn?t\
  \ understand how he does it, but they do know one thing?when Barry says, ?Watch this shot,?\
  \ something insane is about to happen.

ICE_COLD.label=Emotionless in Combat
ICE_COLD.description.0=Barry fights with cold efficiency. No rage, no panic, no excitement?just\
  \ pure calculation. He calls out targets like he?s reading a weather report, lines up shots with\
  \ zero hesitation, and never wastes movement or ammunition. His enemies might scream as their\
  \ ?Mechs go down, but Barry? He just moves to the next target.
ICE_COLD.description.1=There was a time when Barry felt something in battle?adrenaline, fear, even\
  \ anger. But after too many fights, too many losses, something inside him just? shut off. Now, he\
  \ fights with hollow precision, his voice never changing, even when things go horribly wrong. His\
  \ squad doesn?t know if he?s a master of control or if he?s just completely broken inside.
ICE_COLD.description.2=Barry?s complete lack of emotion in combat is deeply unnerving. Missiles\
  \ incoming? No reaction. Squadmate panicking? Monotone: ?Just shoot back.? His voice never rises,\
  \ never wavers?even in the most chaotic moments. His squad has stopped asking if he?s okay; they\
  \ just assume that if Barry ever starts yelling, they're all about to die.

PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.label=Extremely Picky About Gear
PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.description.0=Barry doesn?t just use gear?he curates it. Every weapon, every\
  \ actuator setting, even the paint job is optimized to his exact specifications. If a tech swaps\
  \ out a component without telling him, he immediately notices?and immediately complains. His\
  \ squad knows better than to mess with Barry?s loadout unless they want a full lecture on why\
  \ "standard issue" is just another way of saying "inferior."
PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.description.1=He?s seen too many pilots die because they trusted the wrong gear.\
  \ Barry doesn?t just pick weapons?he obsesses over their reliability, their maintenance history,\
  \ even who installed them. He double-checks every system himself, because in war, the difference\
  \ between life and death is often a single faulty component.
PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.description.2=Barry?s squad dreads when he?s issued new gear because they know\
  \ he?s going to complain about it for hours. The joystick doesn?t feel right, the trigger clicks\
  \ weird, and don?t even get him started on the "atrocity" that is non-customized heat sinks. He\
  \ once refused to pilot a ?Mech because he didn?t like the way the ejection seat felt. His squad\
  \ has given up?they just let him tinker until he?s satisfied.

RECORD_KEEPER.label=Detailed Battle Recorder
RECORD_KEEPER.description.0=Barry logs everything. Every engagement, every enemy maneuver, every\
  \ mistake?he reviews them all. His cockpit battle recorder is meticulously organized, and after\
  \ every mission, he goes through the footage frame by frame, analyzing what worked, what didn?t,\
  \ and what needs improvement. His squad grumbles about the post-battle reviews, but they know one\
  \ thing?Barry never makes the same mistake twice.
RECORD_KEEPER.description.1=To Barry, every battle recorded is a piece of history?and history is\
  \ written by the survivors. He doesn?t just watch the footage for tactics; he watches to remember\
  \ who was there, who fought well, and who never came back. His recordings aren?t just for him -\
  \ they?re for the pilots who won?t get to tell their own stories.
RECORD_KEEPER.description.2=Barry treats his battle recordings like a director editing a holovid.\
  \ He adds commentary, highlights "peak performance moments", and absolutely replays his best\
  \ shots with dramatic zoom-ins. His squad isn't sure if he?s studying footage or just admiring\
  \ his own work, but either way, they?ve all been forced to sit through one of Barry?s "Battle\
  \ Highlights Reels" at least once.

RESOURCE_SCROUNGER.label=Resourceful Scrounger
RESOURCE_SCROUNGER.description.0=Barry never runs out of what he needs?because he knows where to\
  \ find it. Spare heat sinks, backup ammo, even parts from a completely different ?Mech chassis?if\
  \ he doesn?t have it, he?ll find it. His squad doesn?t ask where he gets half his supplies; they\
  \ just know when something breaks, Barry already has a replacement ready to go.
RESOURCE_SCROUNGER.description.1=In the Inner Sphere, resources are life. Barry has fought on too\
  \ many underfunded fronts, too many scavenged battlefields, and too many desperate missions to\
  \ believe in ?proper supply chains.? If something?s needed, he?ll strip it from a wreck, barter\
  \ for it in some backwater market, or jury-rig a solution that?ll hold just long enough to keep\
  \ fighting.
RESOURCE_SCROUNGER.description.2=Barry has an almost supernatural ability to find things. Need rare\
  \ Gauss rounds on a low-tech world? He?s got a guy. Lost a heat sink in the middle of nowhere?\
  \ Barry digs around for an hour and somehow has a spare. His squad has stopped questioning how he\
  \ always comes up with parts?they just assume he has some secret stash hidden across half the\
  \ Inner Sphere.

TRASH_TALKER.label=Relentless Trash Talker
TRASH_TALKER.description.0=Barry doesn?t just trash talk for fun?he weaponizes it. He gets into the\
  \ enemy?s head, baiting them into bad decisions, making them reckless, and keeping them angry\
  \ while he stays focused. ?Is that all you got? I?ve seen Periphery pirates shoot better than\
  \ that.? His squad knows that when Barry starts talking, the enemy is already losing.
TRASH_TALKER.description.1=Barry knows war is hell, and he refuses to let it break him. No matter\
  \ how bad the fight gets, he keeps running his mouth. ?Oh look, another Steiner Assault ?Mech\
  \ hiding behind cover. Real shocking.? It?s not just bravado?it?s how he fights back against the\
  \ bleak reality of the battlefield. If the war?s going to kill him, he?s damn sure going out with\
  \ the last word.
TRASH_TALKER.description.2=Barry trash talks everyone?enemies, squadmates, even his own ?Mech.\
  \ ?C?mon baby, I installed those heat sinks for a reason?don?t let me down now.? He?ll compliment\
  \ an enemy pilot just to insult them two seconds later. ?Nice shot! Oh wait?never mind, that was\
  \ garbage.? His squad has given up trying to stop him, but they have to admit?sometimes, it\
  \ actually works.

CORRECTS_PRONOUNS.label=Quick to Correct Pronouns
CORRECTS_PRONOUNS.description.0=Barry doesn?t make a big deal out of it?he just corrects people\
  \ instantly and moves on. ?Actually, they use ?they/them.? Anyway, we?ve got contacts on the\
  \ ridge.? To him, getting it right is just part of being precise, like making sure his shots land\
  \ or his battlefield intel is accurate.
CORRECTS_PRONOUNS.description.1=Barry has seen too much war, too much death, and too many people\
  \ reduced to callsigns and statistics. If you?re fighting alongside him, your identity matters.\
  \ He doesn?t let anyone get misgendered on his watch, because names, pronouns, and who people are\
  \ - those things shouldn?t get lost to war.
CORRECTS_PRONOUNS.description.2=Barry corrects pronouns with the speed and precision of a targeting\
  \ computer. ?She?excuse me, they?just took out that Hunchback.? His squad has given up trying to\
  \ brush past it quickly, because Barry will always stop to make the correction?even mid-missile\
  \ barrage.

BODY_DISCOMFORT.label=Uncomfortable in Their Own Body
BODY_DISCOMFORT.description.0=Barry doesn?t waste time explaining himself?he has a war to fight. If\
  \ someone gets his pronouns wrong, he corrects them and moves on. His squad respects him because\
  \ he?s damn good at what he does, and when he?s in the cockpit, he?s exactly who he?s supposed to\
  \ be. For Barry, his identity isn?t up for debate?it?s just a fact, like battlefield physics or\
  \ the heat efficiency of a PPC.
BODY_DISCOMFORT.description.1=Barry has spent years rebuilding himself, piece by piece, just like\
  \ he would a battle-worn ?Mech. His body never felt like home, but he?s fixed that?or at least,\
  \ he?s still working on it. He rarely talks about the past, not because he?s ashamed, but because\
  \ it doesn?t define him. What defines him is who he is now?a pilot, a fighter, and a survivor.\
  \ And when he?s in the cockpit, everything finally feels right.
BODY_DISCOMFORT.description.2=Barry has a simple rule: you get his name and pronouns right, or you\
  \ get ignored. He?s dealt with enough nonsense in his life?he?s not about to take any from the\
  \ battlefield, too. His squad quickly learned he doesn?t tolerate disrespect, and honestly? They\
  \ respect the hell out of him for it. Because Barry isn?t just a good pilot?he?s exactly the kind\
  \ of person who will stare down a heavy assault lance and say, ?That all you got??

MEK_COMFORT.label=Uncomfortable Outside the Cockpit
MEK_COMFORT.description.0=Barry operates flawlessly in a ?Mech?but outside of it? He never seems\
  \ fully at ease. His movements feel off, his posture rigid, like he?s always trying to adjust\
  \ something unseen. It?s why he practically lives in his cockpit?because inside a ?Mech,\
  \ everything feels right in a way his own body never does.
MEK_COMFORT.description.1=The battlefield makes sense. The roar of fusion engines, the hum of\
  \ targeting systems?that?s where Barry feels real. His own body? Just another machine with faulty\
  \ wiring. He ignores it, works around it, pushes past the discomfort, because war doesn?t care\
  \ how he feels. But in quiet moments, when the fight is over and the ?Mech is silent?that?s when\
  \ it hits the hardest.
MEK_COMFORT.description.2=Barry has never felt like his body fits him right, and he?s given up\
  \ pretending otherwise. ?I swear, this chassis was built wrong.? He jokes about it?a lot?but his\
  \ squad has noticed how much time he spends in his ?Mech, how much easier he moves in the cockpit\
  \ than on the ground. In combat, he?s fluid, natural, like he belongs?but outside? Like he?s\
  \ always wearing the wrong armor.
