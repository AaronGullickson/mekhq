ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.label=Constantly Adjusting Clothes
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.0.COMBATANT=Every strap, every buckle, every seal - Barry checks them all,\
  \ again and again. His battle gear is adjusted with the same precision no matter the circumstance.\
  \ He {9, choice, 0#believe|1#believes} it's discipline, but in truth, it's a ritual to calm his nerves.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry never feels quite right in his gear, always tugging at a\
  \ strap or shifting his gloves even mid-skirmish. To his lance, it's just a quirk, but those\
  \ who've fought beside him long enough know: Barry is always waiting for disaster. Maybe it's\
  \ because he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen too many comrades get vaped by a laser, or maybe it's just\
  \ instinct. Either way, when Barry starts adjusting his gear a little too often, it's time to take\
  \ cover.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.2.COMBATANT=His gear never fits right. His pistol holster is always too\
  \ tight or too loose. His boots rub raw against his heels. It doesn't matter what uniform he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#wear|1#wears} or what battlefield he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} dropped into - Barry\
  \ will never be comfortable. Some say he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} fidgety. Others think he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ just waiting for the day he won't need to adjust anything ever again. Because dead men don't need\
  \ to fix their collars.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry insists that every uniform, flight suit, and cooling vest\
  \ is properly fitted before deployment. If he {9, choice, 0#see|1#sees} a tech in a grease-stained\
  \ jumpsuit with an undone collar, they'll get an earful - because a ragged warrior is a careless one,\
  \ and carelessness gets people killed.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.1.SUPPORT=Between adjusting his sleeves and straightening his belt, Barry\
  \ runs things with unsettling speed. He can load a DropShip in record time while never once\
  \ standing still. Some think he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} just high-strung, but the company keeps running\
  \ because of him.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry believes if everything is in its place - uniforms pressed,\
  \ boots polished, reports properly filed - maybe, just maybe, fate won't notice him. But in a\
  \ military unit, paperwork means nothing when a JumpShip goes missing, or when the employer\
  \ decides your contract isn't profitable enough to honor. Barry keeps adjusting his cuffs,\
  \ knowing it won't save him.

AFFECTIONATE.label=Overly Affectionate
AFFECTIONATE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry fights like a demon and hugs like a bear. Before a\
  \ mission, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} patting backs, ruffling hair, and making sure everyone knows\
  \ they're his 'family.' Even in the middle of a skirmish, he'll crack jokes and shout encouragement\
  \ over comms. Some love him for it - others just tolerate the inevitable post-mission shoulder\
  \ squeeze.
AFFECTIONATE.description.1.COMBATANT=In the modern military, most people keep their distance - losing\
  \ friends is inevitable. Not Barry. He {9, choice, 0#remember|1#remembers} every name, every fallen\
  \ comrade, and he'll make damn sure no one in his unit dies feeling alone. Whether it's an arm around\
  \ your shoulders before battle or a whispered, "We've got this," before charging into hell, Barry\
  \ refuses to let the universe turn him cold.
AFFECTIONATE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's always there, hand on your shoulder, telling you that\
  \ everything's gonna be okay. He {9, choice, 0#call|1#calls} everyone "buddy," and he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#mean|1#means} it. But those who've been around long enough notice something\
  \ eerie - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} always closest to the ones who don't make it back. It's almost\
  \ like he can sense when it's someone's last fight. And when he {9, choice, 0#give|1#gives} you\
  \ that tight, lingering hug before deployment... well, you better hope he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ wrong.
AFFECTIONATE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry runs things like a family dinner table, always checking if\
  \ you've eaten, gotten enough rest, and if you're warm enough. He {9, choice, 0#hand|1#hands} out\
  \ coffee with a reassuring pat on the back and calls the greenest recruits 'kiddo' regardless of\
  \ their age. Even the grizzled veterans can't stay mad at him for long.
AFFECTIONATE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry means well, but his tendency to clap people on the back,\
  \ sling an arm over their shoulders, or hug them when they least expect it has led to more than\
  \ one awkward moment. His warmth is rare, but let's be real - there's a reason HR gave him another\
  \ warning after that last Christmas party.
AFFECTIONATE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry makes sure everyone feels wanted, needed, remembered. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#laugh|1#laughs} with the fresh-faced recruits, {9, choice, 0#give|1#gives} the\
  \ Techs a warm shoulder squeeze after a long shift, and never {9, choice, 0#let|1#lets} a MekWarrior\
  \ leave without a genuine, "Be safe, okay?" But in this line of work, people disappear - sometimes\
  \ violently, sometimes just gone between contracts. Barry remembers all their names. And he never\
  \ {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops} grieving.

APOLOGETIC.label=Overly Apologetic
APOLOGETIC.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry is a competent warrior, but you'd never know it from the\
  \ way he {9, choice, 0#apologize|1#apologizes} after every shot. Missed a target? "Sorry about that."\
  \ Nailed a headshot? "Hope that wasn't too brutal." Even enemy pilots getting cored out by his\
  \ autocannon might hear a muttered "Didn't mean for it to go that way..." over comms.
APOLOGETIC.description.1.COMBATANT=No matter where he {9, choice, 0#are|1#is}, Barry can't stop\
  \ apologizing. He'll say "Sorry" for calling a warning too late, for calling it too early, for\
  \ asking a question, and sometimes just for existing. He {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} hard, but\
  \ his lance suspects he'd apologize to an inbound PPC if given the chance.
APOLOGETIC.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry says "Sorry" like a prayer. He {9, choice, 0#apologize|1#apologizes}\
  \ to the comrades he couldn't save, to the enemies he had to kill, and to himself for believing the\
  \ fighting would ever end. Maybe he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} already dead inside, or maybe\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} just waiting for the battlefield to make it official. Either way, when\
  \ Barry starts whispering apologies mid-skirmish, it's a bad omen.
APOLOGETIC.description.0.SUPPORT=Need ammo? "Sorry it took so long." Ration packs taste like\
  \ cardboard? "I'm really sorry about that." DropShip delayed by pirate activity? "Wish I could\
  \ fix it, truly." Barry apologizes for things that aren't his fault, but his relentless\
  \ politeness means people rarely yell at him - at least, not for long.
APOLOGETIC.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry is good at his job, but he'll never admit it. No matter how\
  \ well he {9, choice, 0#manage|1#manages} things, he {9, choice, 0#act|1#acts} like a single misstep\
  \ could doom the entire unit. He'll triple-check orders, then apologize for bothering people about\
  \ them. If you thank him, he'll probably just say, "Oh, it wasn't much, really. Sorry if it was."
APOLOGETIC.description.2.SUPPORT=Military life is brutal, and when things go wrong, someone has to\
  \ take the fall. Barry, somehow, always ends up volunteering. A shipment lost to raiders? "I\
  \ should've arranged better security." A contract gone bad? "I should've checked the fine print."\
  \ Even when it's not his fault, Barry takes the weight of the unit's sins - and sooner or later,\
  \ the universe will demand payment.

BOOKWORM.label=Always Reading
BOOKWORM.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's never without a datapad, whether it's field manuals,\
  \ After-Action Reports, or ancient texts on combined-arms strategy. He {9, choice, 0#absorb|1#absorbs}\
  \ tactics like a sponge, always searching for an edge. If you see him flipping through a history\
  \ book before a mission, don't interrupt - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} probably looking for a\
  \ maneuver that saved some long-dead general's skin.
BOOKWORM.description.1.COMBATANT=Between battles, Barry's nose is buried in a book - anything from\
  \ war poetry to pre-spaceflight philosophy. He {9, choice, 0#hope|1#hopes} it helps him make sense\
  \ of the chaos, but his lance worries when he {9, choice, 0#start|1#starts} quoting lines about fate\
  \ and inevitability right before a drop. The last thing you want to hear before a skirmish is\
  \ someone musing about existential doom.
BOOKWORM.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry keeps a small, battered notebook tucked inside his vest.\
  \ It isn't a journal, and it isn't for poetry. It's a list of names - every comrade he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s}\
  \ lost, every enemy he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} killed, every contract that ended in blood. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#read|1#reads} it every night, whispering each name like a mantra. One day, he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows}, someone else will be reading his.
BOOKWORM.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry can fix a supply chain issue in minutes, negotiate a\
  \ contract loophole, and recite the complete corporate history of the Inner Sphere - mostly because\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#read|1#reads} everything. Need a regulation cited or an obscure planetary fact?\
  \ Barry's already flipping to the right page.
BOOKWORM.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's always reading, but the problem is when. Mid-conversation?\
  \ Eyes still on a book. Being addressed by the commander? "Yeah, yeah, one sec." He'll draft an\
  \ action plan while reading an old science-fiction novel and still do a better job than anyone\
  \ else, but it's an open question if he even he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} what planet\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} on half the time.
BOOKWORM.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry reads because he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} to. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#study|1#studies} ancient Terran records, disaster reports, the economic collapses\
  \ of entire planets. He {9, choice, 0#say|1#says} it's to learn from the past, but deep down, he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} the truth - history doesn't repeat, it rhymes. And in this\
  \ business, the verse always ends in war, ruin, and silence.

CALENDAR.label=Keeps a Personal Calendar
CALENDAR.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry has every mission, training session, and equipment check\
  \ meticulously scheduled. He even {9, choice, 0#set|1#sets} reminders for "Check Ammo Reserves" and\
  \ "Pre-Battle Meditation." His lance laughs at him - until they realize he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ never the one caught off-guard when an op gets moved up at the last minute.
CALENDAR.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's calendar isn't just for logistics; it's full of birthdays,\
  \ contract anniversaries, and even the day he first met each member of his lance. He {9, choice, 0#make|1#makes}\
  \ sure to slip a small gift or a kind word to comrades on their special days. Some find it endearing,\
  \ others unsettling - because in this line of work, remembering dates also means remembering who\
  \ didn't make it to the next one.
CALENDAR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's calendar is obsessive. He {9, choice, 0#log|1#logs} every\
  \ mission, every deployment, every injury. He {9, choice, 0#track|1#tracks} trends - how long the\
  \ average warrior lasts in the unit; how many more battles his lance can take before the odds catch\
  \ up. He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen the numbers, and he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows}. There's a date\
  \ circled in red. He won't say what it means, but he {9, choice, 0#check|1#checks} it every day.
CALENDAR.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's calendar isn't just personal - it's the real company\
  \ schedule. Payroll deadlines, JumpShip departures, contract negotiations - he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s}\
  \ got it all mapped out. If the commander wants to know when they're leaving, they don't ask the XO.\
  \ They ask Barry.
CALENDAR.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry believes mercenary life shouldn't be all death and logistics,\
  \ so he {9, choice, 0#make|1#makes} sure to schedule "Company Movie Night," "Optional Poker\
  \ Tournament," and "Morale-Boosting Happy Hour." Even the gruffest veterans roll their eyes at first\
  \ - until they find themselves actually looking forward to "Trivia Night, Hegemony Edition."
CALENDAR.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry keeps a calendar because someone has to. It tells him exactly\
  \ when the company's bank account will run dry, when their 'Meks will finally wear out, and when\
  \ their contracts will leave them stranded in hostile space. He {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} the bad\
  \ news to himself for now, but he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} already penciled in "Final Dissolution of\
  \ Unit" just in case.

CANDLES.label=Fond of Scented Candles
CANDLES.description.0.COMBATANT=The repair bays stink of sweat and burnt wiring, the barracks\
  \ always reek of gun oil, and the battlefield is worse. Barry fights the stink of war with an\
  \ arsenal of lavender, sandalwood, and citrus candles. His squadmates mock him - until they realize\
  \ his bunk actually smells nice.
CANDLES.description.1.COMBATANT=Before every battle, Barry lights a small candle in his\
  \ quarters or in the corner of a DropShip hangar. It's always the same scent, something that\
  \ reminds him of home - wherever that was. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} talk about it, but\
  \ those who've fought beside him know: it's not just a habit. It's a tether, a way to remind himself\
  \ there's still a world beyond the blood and steel.
CANDLES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry used to share a tent, a bunk, or a barracks with someone\
  \ who loved scented candles. They're gone now, but their habit remains. Every time he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#light|1#lights} one, the memory lingers in the air like the smoke curling from the\
  \ wick - fading, but never truly gone.
CANDLES.description.0.SUPPORT=The company barracks are cold, impersonal, and smell like old\
  \ metal - but not Barry's office. His desk is lined with small candles, filling the air with warm\
  \ vanilla, crisp pine, or exotic spices from some world he barely {9, choice, 0#remember|1#remembers}.\
  \ Even the grizzled veterans find themselves stopping by just to breathe for a moment.
CANDLES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's love for scented candles has nearly gotten him banned\
  \ from multiple compounds. Between fire suppression alarms going off and that one time a candle\
  \ nearly ignited a munitions crate, he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} been forced to compromise. Now he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#stick|1#sticks} to flameless aromatherapy diffusers - but deep down, he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} it's not the same.
CANDLES.description.2.SUPPORT=The scent of blood, burning cities, and melted armor haunt\
  \ Barry's memories. He learned long ago that no amount of scrubbing can erase the past. But a \
  candle - one simple, flickering light - can mask it for just a little while. And when the wax burns\
  \ down to nothing, he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} it's time to light another.

CHEWING_GUM.label=Always Chewing Gum
CHEWING_GUM.description.0.COMBATANT=Explosions shake the ground, autocannon fire rips through\
  \ cover, and Barry just keeps chewing gum. His lance swears he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} unflappable\
  \ - always calm, always focused, grinding his teeth through minty freshness while delivering\
  \ precise, lethal fire. If Barry ever spits his gum out in the middle of a fight, then you know\
  \ things are bad.
CHEWING_GUM.description.1.COMBATANT=Whether he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} gunning down enemy infantry,\
  \ dodging PPC blasts, or lining up a shot, Barry's always got a smirk and a fresh stick of gum. He\
  \ pops it in like a pre-battle ritual, as if to say, This is just another day at the office. And\
  \ honestly? He {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} like he {9, choice, 0#believe|1#believes} it.
CHEWING_GUM.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't chew gum for fun. He {9, choice, 0#chew|1#chews}\
  \ because if he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}, his jaw clenches, his stomach knots, and the ghosts\
  \ get a little louder. He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} tasted blood, smoke, and the bitter air of burning\
  \ cities. But as long as he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} chewing, as long as he {9, choice, 0#focus|1#focuses}\
  \ on that single, repetitive motion, he can pretend - just for a little while - that things are\
  \ normal.
CHEWING_GUM.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry juggles manifests, schedules, and disputes all while\
  \ chewing a steady rhythm of bubblegum-flavored efficiency. If he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} blowing\
  \ bubbles in the middle of a meeting, it means he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} already outmaneuvered the\
  \ other side.
CHEWING_GUM.description.1.SUPPORT=The constant snapping, popping, and chewing of gum drives half the\
  \ company insane, but Barry refuses to stop. "It helps me focus," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}.\
  \ And, somehow, it does. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} the only one who can keep track of deployment\
  \ schedules, cargo weights, and which planet their next contract is on without breaking a sweat.
CHEWING_GUM.description.2.SUPPORT=There's not much softness in the military life - just rations,\
  \ burnt coffee, and the bitter taste of war. But gum? Gum reminds Barry that there used to be\
  \ shops, vendors, normalcy. Every time he unwraps a fresh stick, he {9, choice, 0#pretend|1#pretends},\
  \ for just a second, that he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} somewhere else. Somewhere safer. Somewhere that\
  \ still exists.

CHRONIC_LATENESS.label=Chronically Late
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry is never on time, but somehow, he always\
  \ {9, choice, 0#show|1#shows} up just when things are about to go south. Whether it's rolling onto\
  \ the battlefield in a hail of fire, dropping into the fray seconds before an ambush, or sprinting\
  \ to his post as the DropShip doors open, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} living proof that "better late\
  \ than never" sometimes does work.
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's alarms are always ignored, his comms are always buzzing\
  \ with angry messages, and he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} always the last one suited up. No one knows how\
  \ he still {9, choice, 0#manage|1#manages} to be an effective warrior, but somehow, he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#get|1#gets} away with it. The day his luck runs out, though, is going to be\
  \ spectacularly bad.
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.2.COMBATANT=No matter how hard he {9, choice, 0#try|1#tries}, Barry is\
  \ always one step behind. He arrived late to the briefing where his lance was assigned their final\
  \ mission. He reached the rendezvous just in time to see the DropShip leaving without him. He\
  \ sprinted to save his best friend, but by the time he got there, the only thing left was blood.\
  \ He {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} running, {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} trying - but in the end,\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} always too late.
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry is late to everything - staff meetings, supply runs,\
  \ deadlines - but when he finally {9, choice, 0#show|1#shows} up, he {9, choice, 0#solve|1#solves}\
  \ problems like no one else. Need a deadline renegotiated? A missing shipment found? A discrepancy\
  \ fixed? Just give him five more minutes (and then add thirty).
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.1.SUPPORT=Everyone in the company has learned to lie to Barry about\
  \ meeting times. If the briefing is at 08:00, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} told 07:30. If a shuttle\
  \ departs at noon, he {9, choice, 0#get|1#gets} an 11:30 memo. He {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} the\
  \ crew does this. He still {9, choice, 0#manage|1#manages} to be late.
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry wasn't always this way. He used to be punctual, precise.\
  \ But after a while, what's the point? Military units fall apart, contracts get broken, people\
  \ die. Schedules are just an illusion of control in a universe that doesn't care. So Barry lets\
  \ the minutes slip by, knowing deep down that, one day, there won't be any more time left.

CLEANER.label=Compulsive Cleaner
CLEANER.description.0.COMBATANT=Whether it's scrubbing down his gear, wiping every speck of dust\
  \ off his boots, or meticulously cleaning his bunk after a long mission, Barry keeps everything\
  \ spotless. He {9, choice, 0#believe|1#believes} that "clean gear is reliable gear," and to his\
  \ credit, he {9, choice, 0#look|1#looks} good.
CLEANER.description.1.COMBATANT=Before every mission, Barry polishes his sidearm, tightens every\
  \ strap, and scrubs the inside of his helmet until it gleams. Some say it's just ritual; others\
  \ think it's his way of dealing with the chaos of combat. Either way, his unit knows that when\
  \ Barry starts cleaning, it's a sign he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} mentally preparing to face hell.
CLEANER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry is constantly wiping down his gear, scrubbing his hands, and\
  \ sweeping his bunk. No matter how much he {9, choice, 0#clean|1#cleans}, though, the stains are never really gone.\
  \ He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} haunted by the blood he couldn't wash away - whether it's his comrades',\
  \ his enemies', or his own, even he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} no longer sure.
CLEANER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's workspace is a model of precision. Tools are perfectly\
  \ arranged, spare parts gleam under harsh lighting, and every surface is dust-free. Anyone who\
  \ messes up his spotless system is likely to get a mop shoved into their hands and a long lecture\
  \ on "basic respect for shared spaces."
CLEANER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry can't stand clutter, grime, or grease stains, which makes him\
  \ a constant presence in the repair bay. Whether he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} scrubbing someone else's\
  \ tools or wiping down DropShip corridors, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} always cleaning something -\
  \ and somehow, that relentless energy keeps the whole operation running smoother.
CLEANER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry cleans because it's the only thing left that he can control.\
  \ He {9, choice, 0#polish|1#polishes} the windows even though they look out on a dead world. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#scrub|1#scrubs} the briefing table even though no one's gathered around it in\
  \ weeks. One by one, the others are leaving, dying, or simply giving up. Barry just keeps cleaning,\
  \ as if he can scrub away the decay of a company that's already rotting from within.

COLLECTOR.label=Collects Odd Items
COLLECTOR.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry has a knack for finding strange things in the ruins of\
  \ battlefields - enemy insignias, discarded dog tags, fragments of 'Mek armor with odd markings.\
  \ His lance jokes that he could start a museum, but they've all seen him pull out a bent bullet\
  \ casing mid-fight, rub it like a lucky charm, and somehow walk away unscathed.
COLLECTOR.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry collects junk. Old playing cards, broken holovids,\
  \ half-melted action figures. He {9, choice, 0#swear|1#swears} each one has a story, even if it's\
  \ just "found it in a burned-out bunker." Some say it's a harmless habit, but others worry - because\
  \ Barry never throws anything away, even the stuff that should be forgotten.
COLLECTOR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry keeps a little bag tied inside his jacket, filled with\
  \ small trinkets - items he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} taken from the dead. A ration tin from a fallen\
  \ comrade, an enemy warrior's wristwatch, a child's toy found in the wreckage of a bombed-out city.\
  \ He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} know why he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it, only that every time\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#lose|1#loses} someone, he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} to take something to remember\
  \ them. His collection keeps growing. It always grows.
COLLECTOR.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's supply closet isn't just stocked with spare parts and\
  \ ammo - it's got weird stuff. A pre-Hegemony coffee mug, an old recruitment poster, a stuffed\
  \ animal with one button eye. No one knows where he {9, choice, 0#get|1#gets} this junk, but somehow,\
  \ he always {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} exactly what you didn't realize you needed.
COLLECTOR.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry picks up odd relics from every planet the company\
  \ visits - outdated currency, antique tools, even random street signs. "Every piece of junk tells\
  \ a story," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}. But when someone asks why he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} so\
  \ obsessed with lost things, he just {9, choice, 0#shrug|1#shrugs}. "If we don't remember them,\
  \ who will?"
COLLECTOR.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry never leaves a battlefield without taking something - sometimes\
  \ a spent shell casing, sometimes a piece of fabric, sometimes a nameplate from a wrecked 'Mek. It\
  \ started as a way to remember fallen comrades, but now? He {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} things\
  \ from everyone - raiders, civilians, people whose names he never even knew. His collection is a\
  \ graveyard in miniature, and it will never be full.

COMPETITIVE_NATURE.label=Competitive Nature
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has}\
  \ to win. Whether it's in a bar brawl, a shooting contest, or a live-fire battlefield, he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#take|1#takes} every engagement as a personal challenge. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\

  \ One day, that attitude is going to get him killed.
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry turns everything into a competition. Who gets the\
  \ most confirmed kills? Who takes out the enemy 'Mek fastest? Who can pee the furthest? If\
  \ there's a scoreboard, real or imaginary, Barry's keeping track. His lance puts up with\
  \ it - mostly because, despite all the trash talk, he always {9, choice, 0#buy|1#buys} the first\
  \ round of drinks.
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just want to win - he {9, choice, 0#need|1#needs}\
  \ to. When things get desperate, he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} hesitate. He'll break rules,\
  \ take risks no sane person would, leave others behind if it means claiming victory. Because in\
  \ the end, in war, second place is just another name for dead.
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just file reports - he {9, choice, 0#race|1#races}\
  \ against himself to get them done faster than last time. Supply chains? He {9, choice, 0#optimize|1#optimizes}\
  \ them like a battlefield tactician. Budget allocations? He {9, choice, 0#take|1#takes} bets on how\
  \ much he can shave off unnecessary expenses. If you challenge him to an efficiency contest, you\
  \ will lose.
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.1.SUPPORT=Poker night? Barry plays to win. PT drills? He'll run\
  \ extra laps just to prove he can. Even downtime isn't safe - he'll challenge you to arm wrestling,\
  \ trivia, or who can drink the most without passing out. The crew loves him, but sometimes they\
  \ wish he'd let something go just once.
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry tracks wins and losses, not just his own, but\
  \ everyone's. How many battles won, how many contracts failed, how many comrades lost. He used to\
  \ think if he could just get ahead, just win enough, it would mean something. But the names on\
  \ the "Losses" side of his ledger keep growing, and he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} starting to realize\
  \ - maybe, in this life, nobody really wins.

COMPLIMENTS.label=Excessive Complimenter
COMPLIMENTS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry showers his teammates with praise, whether they just\
  \ pulled off a perfect ambush or simply reloaded their weapon without a jam. "Great shot! Perfect\
  \ footwork! Love the way you took cover behind that debris, textbook execution!" He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ genuine about it too - maybe too genuine. Even the most hardened veterans aren't sure how to\
  \ respond when he compliments their "exceptional battlefield posture."
COMPLIMENTS.description.1.COMBATANT=Enemy forces closing in? Barry still finds time to compliment\
  \ someone for their "magnificent trigger discipline" or the lance's scout for "nailing that\
  \ stealthy approach." Some think it's just his way of keeping morale up. Others think\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} stalling, trying to keep himself from processing the violence happening\
  \ around him.
COMPLIMENTS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's compliments aren't just encouragement. They're last\
  \ words in disguise. He {9, choice, 0#want|1#wants} the last thing someone hears before they die\
  \ to be something good. His lance knows that when he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops} fighting to say,\
  \ "You really handled that situation well," it means he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} think they're\
  \ making it out alive.
COMPLIMENTS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry thinks everyone is amazing. The way the MekTechs replace\
  \ a fusion engine? "Brilliant." The way the warriors dock their Mek? "Precision work." The way\
  \ the cook managed to make ration packs almost edible? "A culinary triumph." He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#hand|1#hands} out praise so fast and frequently that no one's sure if\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} being sarcastic - but he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} absolutely serious.
COMPLIMENTS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry can make even the most jaded warriors uncomfortable with\
  \ his relentless positivity. Military companies are built on cynicism, but Barry? Barry will\
  \ look a tired, underpaid, underappreciated AsTech dead in the eye and say, "You're the backbone\
  \ of this operation. Without you, we're nothing." And damn it - sometimes that's exactly what you\
  \ need to hear.
COMPLIMENTS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry gives compliments like his life depends on it. Maybe, in a\
  \ way, it does. He {9, choice, 0#want|1#wants} to believe that if he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#acknowledge|1#acknowledges} every small act of skill, courage, or kindness, it\
  \ matters. That in a universe of endless war and forgotten lives, someone's efforts will be seen.\
  \ Because if they aren't, if people are just lost and unremembered - then what was the point of\
  \ it all?

DAYDREAMER.label=Prone to Daydreaming
DAYDREAMER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry has a habit of staring off into the distance, lost in\
  \ thoughts of battlefield maneuvers and hypothetical scenarios. "What if we used a pincer\
  \ formation, but with jump-capable units repositioning mid-battle?" he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters},\
  \ mid-skirmish. His ideas are often brilliant - if only he'd stop zoning out long enough to share\
  \ them before bullets start flying.
DAYDREAMER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry fights because he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} to, but his\
  \ mind is always elsewhere - strolling through the jungles of some uncharted world, watching the\
  \ sunrise over a crystalline ocean, or fighting through a battlefield that isn't real, where no\
  \ one dies and every shot is just for sport. War has a way of pulling him back to reality, violently.
DAYDREAMER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry spends more and more time staring into nothing, lost in\
  \ memories of places he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} never been, people he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} never\
  \ met. He {9, choice, 0#flinch|1#flinches} at explosions a little less than he used to. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} even notice the warnings blaring in his HUD anymore. One day,\
  \ he won't snap back at all - his mind will keep drifting while his body is torn apart by war.
DAYDREAMER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry is great at his job - when he {9, choice, 0#remember|1#remembers}\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} one. One second, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} calculating JumpShip fuel\
  \ reserves; the next, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} staring at a loading crane, imagining how much more\
  \ efficient it would be if they redesigned the entire docking system. Someone usually has to snap\
  \ him out of it before he redesigns the entire payroll system.
DAYDREAMER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry dreams of things beyond war: a better future, a life\
  \ outside of contracts and bloodshed, a world where people don't have to sell their lives for\
  \ money. He {9, choice, 0#write|1#writes} down these ideas in an old, worn notebook. No one knows\
  \ if he actually {9, choice, 0#believe|1#believes} in them, or if it's just a way to distract\
  \ himself from the reality of his work.
DAYDREAMER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry reads old records, stories of lost worlds, of cities\
  \ untouched by war, of a time when life wasn't dictated by strategy and firepower. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#dream|1#dreams} about them, too - vivid, detailed dreams that feel more real than\
  \ the dim, gray present. Maybe it's just escapism. Or maybe, deep down, he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows}\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#were|1#was} born in the wrong century, and this war-torn existence was never\
  \ meant for him.

DOODLER.label=Compulsive Doodler
DOODLER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's field manual is covered in scribbles - little sketches of\
  \ battle formations, enemy 'Mek silhouettes, and doodled maps of planets he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s}\
  \ never even been to. His commanders are annoyed, but his lance swears that more than once, one of\
  \ Barry's absentminded sketches ended up being the key to surviving an operation.
DOODLER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's war journal is supposed to be for mission notes, but it's\
  \ filled with sketches of things not on the battlefield: towering trees from some distant world,\
  \ the face of a woman he can't quite remember, the endless stars above the DropShip bay. Maybe he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} so one day he won't have to anymore.
DOODLER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry fills every spare scrap of paper with drawings - names carved\
  \ into ruined buildings, faces half-remembered, insignias from units that no longer exist. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#say|1#says} he {9, choice, 0#draw|1#draws} so he won't forget, but the way he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#look|1#looks} at his sketches, like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} haunted by\
  \ them... maybe he already {9, choice, 0#have|1#has}.
DOODLER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's official reports always come back with little sketches in\
  \ the margins - better weapon mounting brackets, new DropShip layouts, a completely redesigned\
  \ coolant system. Some of his ideas are insane. Some get implemented. The tech crews have learned\
  \ to always check his notes
DOODLER.description.1.SUPPORT=Briefings, budget reviews, deployment schedules - Barry listens,\
  \ technically, but his notepad is always filled with little cartoons of his comrades, absurdly\
  \ detailed 'Mek drawings, or a sketch of the commander looking way too serious. Half the company\
  \ keeps his doodles as personal trophies.
DOODLER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's doodles have changed. Once, they were harmless, funny little\
  \ scribbles. Now, they're battlefields reduced to smoldering craters, 'Meks collapsing in fire,\
  \ DropShips breaking apart in orbit. When asked about them, he just {9, choice, 0#shrug|1#shrugs}.\
  \ "I don't know," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}. "Sometimes I feel like I'm just drawing what's\
  \ going to happen."

DOOLITTLE.label=Talks to Animals
DOOLITTLE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry will stop mid-patrol to have a full conversation with a\
  \ local stray or a scavenger bird perched on a ruined building. His lance teases him for it - until\
  \ a pack of giant canines doesn't attack them, or an avian swarm takes off suddenly, giving him\
  \ just enough warning before an ambush. Maybe Barry's just lucky. Or maybe the animals know\
  \ something the rest of them don't.
DOOLITTLE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't care much for the politics and ego battles of\
  \ military life. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} more comfortable talking to a DropShip's cat or a bunker\
  \ rat than his commanding officer. "Animals don't lie, and they don't stab you in the back for a\
  \ bigger payday," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}. "You could learn a thing or two from 'em."
DOOLITTLE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's seen too many comrades die. He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} stopped\
  \ trying to make real connections with people - they never last. But animals? They don't ask\
  \ questions. They don't make promises they can't keep. And when Barry whispers to a half-starved\
  \ dog before a skirmish, telling it to run and hide, it's not because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ worried about the mutt. It's because, deep down, he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} it'll outlive him.
DOOLITTLE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry talks to every animal that wanders into camp - whether it's a\
  \ lizard sunning itself on a crate or a cargo bay rat sneaking rations. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ the reason the company somehow has a "mascot," even though nobody remembers adopting it.
DOOLITTLE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry insists animals understand him. The company's techs were\
  \ skeptical - until he got a half-feral warehouse dog to stop stealing rations, or convinced a\
  \ colony of birds to roost outside the DropShip's exhaust ports instead of inside them. No one\
  \ knows how he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it, but it's saved them a lot of maintenance hours.
DOOLITTLE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has a habit of talking to stray animals like they're the\
  \ only ones who really understand him. He {9, choice, 0#say|1#says} things to them he'd never admit\
  \ to another human - his fears, his regrets, the things he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen that still\
  \ keep him up at night. "At least you won't lie to me," he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters} to a\
  \ one-eyed cat. It just stares at him, unblinking, as if it knows.

DRAMATIC.label=Overly Dramatic
DRAMATIC.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry never just reloads - he {9, choice, 0#florish|1#florishes}\
  \ like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} starring in a war epic. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} dive for\
  \ cover, he {9, choice, 0#hurl|1#hurls} himself into it. Every fight is a set piece, every\
  \ victory a monologue waiting to happen. His lance rolls their eyes, but they have to admit - when\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#pull|1#pulls} off a perfectly timed, slow-motion explosion escape, it's damn\
  \ impressive.
DRAMATIC.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry describes battle like it's high art. "The PPC arcs like a\

  \ "The battlefield sings with the percussion of autocannons and missile strikes." His lance just\

DRAMATIC.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he {9, choice, 0#play|1#plays} a role.\
  \ He {9, choice, 0#want|1#wants} his last stand to be legendary, his name whispered in hushed tones\
  \ long after he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} gone. If he {9, choice, 0#fall|1#falls}, it has to be in a\
  \ blaze of glory, outnumbered but never outmatched. The problem is... war doesn't care about\
  \ theatrics. And no one remembers the dead the way they think they will.
DRAMATIC.description.0.SUPPORT="Ah, once again we are denied the spare fusion engines we so\
  \ desperately need! Shall we resign ourselves to ICEs, or dare we defy fate and improvise?" Barry\
  \ narrates every minor setback like it's a Shakespearean tragedy. Somehow, the sheer absurdity of\
  \ it makes the bureaucracy almost tolerable.
DRAMATIC.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just deliver status reports - he {9, choice, 0#perform|1#performs}\

  \ and {9, choice, 0#gasp|1#gasps} in mock horror at every budget cut. The higher-ups are exasperated,\
  \ but his dramatic delivery actually keeps people awake during meetings, so they tolerate him.\
  \ Barely.
DRAMATIC.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry speaks in grand, sweeping terms because he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows}\
  \ the truth: in war, most lives are forgotten, reduced to a footnote in someone else's report. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to let that happen. He {9, choice, 0#remember|1#remembers} the\
  \ dead, {9, choice, 0#tell|1#tells} their stories, {9, choice, 0#make|1#makes} their sacrifices\

EATING_HABITS.label=Unpredictable Eating Habits
EATING_HABITS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry will go an entire day without eating, only to inhale\
  \ three full MREs right before a drop. Sometimes, he {9, choice, 0#forget|1#forgets} to eat at all,\
  \ other times, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} gnawing on a ration bar mid-skirmish. His lance has stopped\
  \ questioning it - except for the tim he casually sipped a protein shake while under heavy fire.
EATING_HABITS.description.1.COMBATANT=One day, Barry is choking down cold canned mystery meat in a\
  \ muddy crater like everyone else. The next, he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} somehow managed to sear a\
  \ cut of unknown protein over an engine vent and is sprinkling scavenged spices on it. "Eat well\
  \ when you can," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, as if anyone else has time for battlefield fine dining.
EATING_HABITS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry either forgets to eat for days or devours everything in\
  \ sight, like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} afraid there won't be another meal. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}\
  \ talk about it, but those who know him well suspect he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} been through famine,\
  \ blockade, or a siege. He never {9, choice, 0#waste|1#wastes} food. He never {9, choice, 0#complain|1#complains}\

  \ at all.
EATING_HABITS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry tracks every supply shipment, fuel order, and ration\

  \ It's not uncommon to find him gnawing on a stale protein bar at 3 AM while recalculating fuel\
  \ logistics, as if he just remembered that human beings require sustenance.
EATING_HABITS.description.1.SUPPORT=One day, Barry is eating gourmet-grade imported beef from a\
  \ high-end merchant. The next, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} happily spooning up a cold can of something\
  \ labeled only as "Meat Derivative." Nobody can predict what he'll eat next, and at this point, no\

EATING_HABITS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry eats like someone who's seen real hunger. He never\

ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.description.2.COMBATANT=Every harsh wind feels like the bite of an old\

EXCESSIVE_GREETING.label=Over-the-Top Greetings

EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry treats every greeting like a full-scale reunion.\
  \ Even if he saw you five minutes ago, he'll wave both arms, slap you on the back, and shout your\

  \ {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} need targeting computers - he just {9, choice, 0#look|1#looks} at\
  \ a target long enough and the shot finds its mark. It'd be impressive if it weren't so unsettling.
EYE_CONTACT.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's stare is hollow, deep, wrong. He {9, choice, 0#look|1#looks}\
  \ through people, past them, as if he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seeing something beyond the present moment.\
  \ It's like he already {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} how this battle will end - how everyone's battle\
  \ will end. And when he {9, choice, 0#look|1#looks} at you too long, you start to wonder... does he\
  \ see your fate, too?
EYE_CONTACT.description.0.SUPPORT=Trying to get extra rations? Claiming you never got issued ammo?\
  \ Barry doesn't even need to check the manifest. He just {9, choice, 0#stare|1#stares} at you,\
  \ silent, waiting. Within seconds, most people break down and confess. "Okay, fine, I did take an\
  \ extra case of heat sinks. Just stop looking at me like that."
EYE_CONTACT.description.1.SUPPORT=A casual chat with Barry is anything but casual. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#maintain|1#maintains} direct, unwavering eye contact the entire time, no matter how\
  \ mundane the topic. Whether he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} talking about supply shipments or asking if\
  \ you've eaten today, it always feels like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} staring into your soul.
EYE_CONTACT.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just look at people - he {9, choice, 0#memorize|1#memorizes}\
  \ them. The shape of their scars, the flicker of hesitation in their voice, the way they tense when\
  \ discussing past battles. It's not just observation; it's cataloging. Because Barry knows that in a\
  \ military unit, faces disappear. And someone has to remember them.

FASHION_CHOICES.label=Eccentric Fashion Choices
FASHION_CHOICES.description.0.COMBATANT=While the rest of the lance sticks to standard-issue gear,\
  \ Barry finds ways to stand out. Maybe it's a bright red scarf tied around his neck, a\
  \ custom-painted helmet with flair, or a ridiculous pair of aviator shades that he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#insist|1#insists} improve his targeting. He {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} just as\
  \ hard as anyone else, but he'll be damned if he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it without style.
FASHION_CHOICES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry has one piece of gear he {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses}\
  \ to part with - an old leather jacket, a neon-colored sash, or maybe a battered hula girl that\
  \ somehow survived a cockpit ejection. He {9, choice, 0#believe|1#believes} it's lucky. His lance\
  \ claims it's a liability. But after seeing him walk away from three near-death situations, nobody\
  \ tells him to leave it behind anymore.
FASHION_CHOICES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's patches don't match. His gear is a mix of different\
  \ uniforms, scavenged from fallen enemies, lost comrades, or abandoned battlefields. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#say|1#says} it's "just practical." But every piece has a name behind it, a story\
  \ he won't tell. And when he {9, choice, 0#gear|1#gears} up, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} not just\
  \ wearing armor - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} carrying ghosts.
FASHION_CHOICES.description.0.SUPPORT=Everyone else in the company wears standard fatigues. Barry?\
  \ Barry struts around the hangar in a velvet waistcoat, a brightly patterned scarf, or a jumpsuit\
  \ covered in custom patches from a dozen different outfits. He {9, choice, 0#argue|1#argues} that\
  \ if he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} to run support for a bunch of killers, he might as well look\
  \ good doing it.
FASHION_CHOICES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's wardrobe is a mystery. One day, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ in a full Hegemony officer's coat (with no explanation). The next, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} wearing\
  \ knee-high boots and a flamboyant sash like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} leading a parade. The only\
  \ constant is that no one ever sees him wear the same outfit twice. Where does he get this stuff?\
  \ No one knows.
FASHION_CHOICES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's clothes don't fit the war-torn world he {9, choice, 0#live|1#lives}\
  \ in. His coats are pristine, his accessories impractical, his boots polished like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ about to attend a grand ball instead of supporting a military unit. He {9, choice, 0#dress|1#dresses}\
  \ like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} from a world that hasn't existed in centuries - as if, by refusing\
  \ to acknowledge reality, he can pretend it still does.

FIDGETS.label=Constantly Fidgeting
FIDGETS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry is always moving - tapping his fingers on his leg, adjusting\
  \ his gloves, shifting his stance even when in cover. His lance used to think he {9, choice, 0#were|1#was}\
  \ anxious, but no - this is just how he {9, choice, 0#operate|1#operates}. He {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} better when he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} in motion. And judging by\
  \ his reaction time, he might actually be right.
FIDGETS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's knee bounces when he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} on a stakeout.\
  \ His hands tap rhythms when he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} waiting to drop. His fingers drum against his\
  \ sidearm before a fight. Some say it's nerves, some say it's a bad habit - but whatever it is,\
  \ it's impossible to ignore. His lance isn't sure if it makes him more dangerous, or if one day,\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} just going to snap.
FIDGETS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry fidgets because if he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops} moving, his\
  \ hands remember. He {9, choice, 0#remember|1#remembers} the recoil of every shot, the weight of a\
  \ dying friend, the texture of dried blood under his nails. He {9, choice, 0#play|1#plays} with\
  \ his gear, {9, choice, 0#tap|1#taps} his fingers, {9, choice, 0#shift|1#shifts} his stance - not\
  \ because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} impatient, but because stillness brings memories, and memories\
  \ are worse than war.
FIDGETS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry is always doing something, even when he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}\
  \ need to be. If he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} talking to you, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} also reorganizing\
  \ crates, flipping a pen between his fingers, or double-checking inventory counts that don't actually\
  \ need to be checked. He {9, choice, 0#call|1#calls} it "efficient multitasking." Everyone else calls\
  \ it "exhausting to watch."
FIDGETS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't attend briefings so much as survive them. He {9, choice, 0#tap|1#taps}\
  \ on tables, {9, choice, 0#spin|1#spins} a datapad in his hands, or starts disassembling and\
  \ reassembling whatever piece of equipment is within reach. He {9, choice, 0#swear|1#swears} it\
  \ helps him focus, but more than once, a commander has had to stop mid-sentence to tell him to put\
  \ that back together.
FIDGETS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry keeps his hands busy, always. If he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} moving,\
  \ if he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} doing something, then maybe he won't think about how many people\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen walk to their death, how many jobs he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} approved\
  \ that led to ruin, how many times he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} signed off on death orders disguised as\
  \ payroll. His hands shake when they're empty, so he {9, choice, 0#make|1#makes} sure they never are.

FITNESS.label=Extreme Personal Fitness Routine
FITNESS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just stay in shape - he {9, choice, 0#push|1#pushes}\
  \ himself beyond reason. If the lance is running drills, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} doing extra laps.\
  \ If they're training, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} doing push-ups between maneuvers. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#treat|1#treats} his body like a weapon, and he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} determined to\
  \ keep it sharpened at all times.
FITNESS.description.1.COMBATANT=If Barry can do something in a harder, more exhausting way, he\
  \ will. He {9, choice, 0#sprint|1#sprints} to the DropShip instead of walking, does pull-ups on\
  \ cargo racks, and somehow turns reloading a missile rack into a full-body workout. "Gotta stay\
  \ combat-ready," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, between sets of one-arm push-ups.
FITNESS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry trains as if trying to break himself. He {9, choice, 0#push|1#pushes}\
  \ through injuries, {9, choice, 0#ignore|1#ignores} exhaustion, and {9, choice, 0#punish|1#punishes}\
  \ his body like it owes him something. Maybe he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} trying to outlast the war,\
  \ or maybe he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} just waiting for the day his body finally gives out - because\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} the battlefield won't do it cleanly.
FITNESS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry may work support, but he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} built like an elite\
  \ commando. He {9, choice, 0#wake|1#wakes} up before the MekWarriors to train, runs extra PT drills,\
  \ and somehow convinces maintenance crews to do push-ups while waiting for system diagnostics. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#insist|1#insists} it's just a hobby, but when he casually {9, choice, 0#deadlift|1#deadlifts}\
  \ a supply crate meant for two people, no one's sure anymore.
FITNESS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry turns everything into exercise. Organizing inventory? He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#carry|1#carries} two crates at once for the added resistance. Long-haul travel on\
  \ a JumpShip? He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} doing workouts in zero-G. If he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ standing still, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} probably clenching his abs just to make sure\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} "maximizing muscle engagement."
FITNESS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry trains life someone expecting the worst. Even though he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#run|1#runs} support, he {9, choice, 0#prep|1#preps} like he'll be the last line of\
  \ defense. His body is covered in micro-injuries, stress fractures, and old bruises that never heal\
  \ right. He {9, choice, 0#say|1#says} he just "likes to stay in shape." But his eyes say\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} afraid of what'll happen if he ever {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}.

FIXATES.label=Fixates on One Topic
FIXATES.description.0.COMBATANT=Once Barry gets an idea in his head, nothing will get him to drop\
  \ it. If he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} convinced a flanking maneuver is the best strategy, he'll argue\
  \ about it until deployment. If he {9, choice, 0#think|1#thinks} a certain loadout is ideal, he'll\
  \ lecture anyone who'll listen. Sometimes it's annoying - but sometimes, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ right.
FIXATES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry has a special interest and you will hear about it.\
  \ Maybe it's the history of a specific battle, maybe it's the aerodynamics of autocannon rounds,\
  \ maybe it's the exact specifications of every BattleMek ever made. Whatever it is, once he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#start|1#starts} talking, there's no stopping him.
FIXATES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry latches onto a topic with desperation. He {9, choice, 0#throw|1#throws}\
  \ himself into technical specs, tactics, anything that keeps his mind from wandering. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} if he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}  thinking about this, he'll start\
  \ thinking about everything else - the battles he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} lost, the friends who never\
  \ made it back, the creeping realization that the fighting never really ends.
FIXATES.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry has one passion: streamlining supply chains. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} charts. He {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} diagrams. He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s}\
  \ written essays about how they could shave seconds off deployment times. The company's operations\
  \ have never been smoother - but someone please get him to talk about anything else.
FIXATES.description.1.SUPPORT=No matter where a conversation starts, Barry will bring it back to\
  \ his chosen topic. "Oh, you're talking about planetary weather patterns? That reminds me of how\
  \ desert conditions affect 'Mek heat sinks!" No one knows how he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it. No\
  \ one wants him to do it.
FIXATES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry fixates because if he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}, his mind\
  \ starts wandering to places it shouldn't. It's easier to focus on logistics, or 'Mek classifications,\
  \ or the finer points of battlefield tactics than to acknowledge what he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ really doing - desperately clinging to one thing in a universe that's constantly tearing everything\
  \ else away.

FLASK.label=Carries a Flask
FLASK.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's flask isn't just for drinking - it's ritual. A sip before\
  \ battle for luck, a sip after for survival. He {9, choice, 0#swear|1#swears} it keeps him steady,\
  \ keeps the nerves from creeping in. His lance jokes that he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} pickling himself\
  \ so he can live forever.
FLASK.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's flask is always full, and he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} always\
  \ willing to pass it around. Before a mission, after a mission, in the middle of one if things are\
  \ slow enough. "Nothing wrong with a quick sip," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, handing it over with\
  \ a grin. No one's sure if it's actual alcohol, battlefield coffee, or something worse - but\
  \ whatever it is, it burns.
FLASK.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry drinks because if he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}, the memories\
  \ come crawling back. The faces of the dead, the screams over comms, the way burning metal smells\
  \ just like burning flesh. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} not drinking to get drunk - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ drinking to function. The flask is always with him. It has to be. Because the moment it's empty,\
  \ the past comes rushing in.
FLASK.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's flask isn't just for himself - it's for everyone.\
  \ He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got a special reserve for MekWarriors after a hard fight, a backup stash\
  \ for celebrating a rare win, and a hidden emergency bottle for when things really go to hell. His\
  \ philosophy? A military unit runs on money, ammo, and just enough booze to keep people sane.
FLASK.description.1.SUPPORT="It's just for the nerves," Barry says, casually taking a sip while\
  \ filing requests. "Good for circulation." He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got an excuse for every\
  \ situation - cold weather, bad food, long meetings. If he ever actually ran out, the entire support\
  \ staff would probably collapse from shock.
FLASK.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't drink for fun. He {9, choice, 0#drink|1#drinks} because he\
  \ made {9, choice, 0#choice|1#choices} - signed orders that got people killed, approved supply runs\
  \ that never made it back, trusted the wrong people. The flask is his way of forgetting, if only\
  \ for a moment. But no matter how much he {9, choice, 0#drink|1#drinks}, the ledger never balances.

FOOT_TAPPER.label=Always Tapping Foot
FOOT_TAPPER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's foot is always tapping - against the floor of the\
  \ DropShip, against the dirt in the parade ground, against the side of an ammo crate during a\
  \ briefing. It's like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} waiting for something to happen, like\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} just a half-second away from bolting into action. His lance has learned\
  \ that when Barry's foot stops tapping, that's when things are about to get serious.
FOOT_TAPPER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't sit still. His foot taps because his whole body\
  \ wants to move. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} the first one geared up, the first one out the DropShip,\
  \ and the first one pushing the pace in an assault. When he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} forced to wait,\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#get|1#gets} jittery, practically vibrating with impatience. "Hurry up and get\
  \ to the shooting part," he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}, tapping away.
FOOT_TAPPER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's foot taps to a rhythm that no one else can hear. Maybe\
  \ it's an old war march, maybe it's the echoes of battles past, or maybe it's just his way of\
  \ staying present. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} talk about it, but some nights, when everything\
  \ is quiet, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} still tapping. Like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} counting down to\
  \ something only he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} is coming.
FOOT_TAPPER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's foot taps as he {9, choice, 0#calculate|1#calculates} supply orders, budget\
  \ projections, and shipment schedules in real-time. It's like his brain is moving too fast for\
  \ his body to keep up. The tapping isn't impatience - it's momentum. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ already thinking about the next problem before anyone else even realizes there is one.
FOOT_TAPPER.description.1.SUPPORT=The tapping never stops. Boardroom table? Tap tap tap. Cargo bay\
  \ inspection? Tap tap tap. Even when he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} standing still, the sound of his boot\
  \ against the deck is constant. No one knows if he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} nervous, bored, or just\
  \ wired differently - but after a while, people start tapping along without realizing it.
FOOT_TAPPER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry taps his foot to remind himself he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} alive.\
  \ That he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} still moving, still breathing, still part of this world. Some nights,\
  \ after too many bad missions, he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} to force his foot to tap - because if\
  \ it stops, even for a second, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} afraid he won't be able to start it again.

FORGETFUL.label=Chronically Forgetful
FORGETFUL.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry is a solid fighter, but damn if he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}\
  \ always forget something before a mission. Harness? Left it in the barracks. Comms check? Oops.\
  \ Forgot to eat before deployment? Absolutely. His lance has learned to double-check his gear along\
  \ with their own because, sooner or later, Barry is going to pat himself down and go, "Wait...\
  \ where's my sidearm?"
FORGETFUL.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry remembers battle tactics, enemy weak points, and how to\
  \ compensate for environmental conditions perfectly. But ask him what day it is? Who they're\
  \ fighting this week? Whether he ate before a mission? Gone. His mind is laser-focused on combat,\
  \ but the second they get back to base, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} back to asking, "Wait, what planet\
  \ is this again?"
FORGETFUL.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't forget because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} careless. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#forget|1#forgets} because his head is already full - full of old battlefields, old\
  \ mistakes, old names. There's only so much room in a person's memory, and Barry made a choice long\
  \ ago: he'll never forget the fallen, even if it means losing everything else.
FORGETFUL.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry is great at managing supplies. He {9, choice, 0#remember|1#remembers}\
  \ critical shipment schedules, high-priority requests, and budget restrictions flawlessly. But\
  \ somehow, he always forgets one thing - sometimes minor, sometimes catastrophic. "Oh, we were\
  \ supposed to order coolant last cycle? Uh... whoops."
FORGETFUL.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry forgets names, times, and occasionally his own job title,\
  \ but somehow, the company still runs. He {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} the entire operation afloat\
  \ through sheer instinct, despite being the one who asks, "wait, did I eat today?" while running\
  \ inventory checks.
FORGETFUL.description.2.SUPPORT=At first, Barry just forgot little things - dates, meetings, faces.\
  \ Then it got worse. Entire conversations lost. Mission details slipping. A comrade's name, right\
  \ on the tip of his tongue, but... gone. He {9, choice, 0#laugh|1#laughs} it off,\
  \ {9, choice, 0#pretend|1#pretends} it's nothing, but deep down, he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows}:\
  \ one day, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} going to forget something that really matters. Maybe he\
  \ already {9, choice, 0#have|1#has}.

FORMAL_SPEECH.label=Overly Formal Speech
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry delivers battlefield reports like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ speaking in a royal court. "Sir, I must inform you that our current tactical position is most\
  \ untenable." His lance {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} given up trying to get him to talk like a normal\
  \ human being, and at this point, they just roll with it.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry insists on addressing even his closest comrades as\
  \ "Lieutenant," "Sergeant," or "esteemed colleague." No one knows if it's a quirk, a joke, or if\
  \ he actually {9, choice, 0#think|1#thinks} they're all attending a formal gala instead of wading\
  \ through battlefield wreckage. Either way, it makes war sound bizarrely polite.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry speaks like someone out of time, using words and phrases\
  \ that no one has in years. Maybe it's because he came from somewhere refined. Maybe it's a\
  \ desperate attempt to hold on to a piece of himself before war grinds him into dust like\
  \ everyone else. Or maybe... he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} that once he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}\
  \ speaking this way, there'll be nothing left of the person he used to be.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's supply reports don't just list numbers - they tell a\
  \ story. "It is with deep regret that I must inform you that our reserve ammunition stocks have\
  \ dwindled to perilous levels, necessitating swift resupply lest we court catastrophe." The\
  \ commander sighs, but at least someone in the unit is keeping things interesting.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just give briefings. He {9, choice, 0#deliver|1#delivers}\
  \ them with the gravitas of a statesman addressing a planetary congress. "Honored comrades, we find\
  \ ourselves at a most critical juncture in our fiscal projections." Everyone wishes he'd just say\
  \ they're running low on cash, but at least it makes budget meetings marginally less soul-crushing.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry speaks with eloquence and grace because someone has to.\
  \ The universe is brutal, war is endless, and civility is dying. If he {9, choice, 0#start|1#starts}\
  \ talking like the rest of them - cold, clipped, brutal - then what's left? Just another gun for\
  \ hire, another cog in the war machine. He {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses}. Even if it makes him\
  \ sound ridiculous, he {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses}.

FURNITURE.label=Constantly Rearranges Furniture
FURNITURE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry treats every space like a battlefield map. Barracks layout?\
  \ He {9, choice, 0#adjust|1#adjusts} the bunks for "optimal emergency evacuation routes." DropShip\
  \ lounge? The chairs need to be "fortified positions in case of boarding actions." His lance rolls\
  \ their eyes when they find their lockers moved again - but deep down, they know he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ probably not wrong.
FURNITURE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry never leaves a room the way he found it. He'll shift crates\
  \ in the hangar, move chairs around briefing rooms, and completely rearrange the break area just\
  \ because it didn't feel right. No one knows why he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it, but at this point,\
  \ the unit just waits for 'The Barry Edition' of any given room before getting comfortable.
FURNITURE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry moves furniture not for comfort, but for survival. Every\
  \ table, every chair, every bunk - every piece has to be in the right place. Barricades, fallback\
  \ positions, places to hide. He learned the hard way that when an ambush comes, your surroundings\
  \ matter. If his lance thinks he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} obsessive, that's fine - one day, it might\
  \ save their lives.
FURNITURE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry is incapable of leaving a room alone. The storage crates?\
  \ Better flow if they're stacked this way. The command center? Desks should be closer for\
  \ efficiency. The mess hall? Obviously, tables need to be rotated 45 degrees for maximum comfort.\
  \ The crew walks in every morning never knowing what new layout Barry has cooked up.
FURNITURE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry can't stop tweaking the company's base layout. "This would\
  \ be way more functional if the tool racks were over there." "Why is the coffee machine so far\
  \ from the main entry?" It doesn't matter if it's a barracks, a mobile command center, or a\
  \ DropShip cargo hold - Barry will optimize it, even if it means driving everyone insane.
FURNITURE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry moves furniture, gear, everything - not because it matters,\
  \ but because it's something he can change. He can't control which contracts they take, who lives\
  \ or dies, or when the next battle will come. But he can control where the damn chairs go. And\
  \ some days, that's the only thing keeping him from losing his mind.

GLASSES.label=Constantly Adjusts Glasses
GLASSES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just push up his glasses - he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does}\

GLASSES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry looks like he should be in a research lab, not a battlefield.\
  \ His glasses are always slipping down his nose, his HUD is constantly recalibrating for glare,\
  \ and he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} the only one who checks a damage report before checking his own\

GLASSES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry pushes up his glasses like it'll make the world clearer, like\

GLASSES.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's glasses are always slipping because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ always reading - contract clauses, supply manifests, tech manuals in languages he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} actually speak. If there's a scam in a deal, he'll find it. If\

  \ need an adjustment, but they never miss a detail.
GLASSES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry adjusts his glasses so often that people have started using it\
  \ as a warning sign. If he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} doing it absentmindedly while scribbling notes,\

GLOVES.label=Always Wearing Gloves
GLOVES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry insists that good grip is everything. Whether he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ scoffing down an expired MRE, cleaning his sidearm, or attending a mandatory training meeting,\
  \ his gloves are always on. He {9, choice, 0#think|1#thinks} they improve performance, reduce wear\
  \ on his hands, and help keep sweat from ruining his trigger control. His lance thinks\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} being excessive - until their own hands are blistered and bruised while\
  \ his are perfectly fine.
GLOVES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry is always wearing gloves, no exceptions. No one has ever seen\
  \ him take them off - not to eat, not to fix his gear, not even to shake hands. Some assume it's\
  \ habit, others think it's superstition. The truth? Barry won't say, and no one has the nerve to\
  \ ask.
GLOVES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's gloves aren't just habit - they're armor. Beneath them, his\
  \ hands tell stories no one else is allowed to read - burns from an engine explosion, deep scars\
  \ from a knife fight, skin that's never fully healed from exposure to toxic rain. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#cover|1#covers} them up because if he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}, he'll have\
  \ to explain. And he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} want to remember.
GLOVES.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry handles supply crates, repair tools, and even paperwork with\
  \ gloved hands. "You do not want to know how dirty these surfaces are," he {9, choice, 0#insist|1#insists}\
  \ while disinfecting a shipment manifest. The tech crews roll their eyes, but when they see what\
  \ actually grows inside a poorly maintained coolant line, they start wondering if he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s}\
  \ got a point.
GLOVES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry cycles through different gloves for different jobs. No matter\
  \ the occasion, he always {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} the right pair ready. At this point, it's just\
  \ part of who he {9, choice, 0#are|1#is}.
GLOVES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry wears gloves because he {9, choice, 0#remember|1#remembers}. The\
  \ first time he felt warm blood seep through his fingers, the first time he held a dying friend's\
  \ hand, the first time he had to scrub his own hands raw to get rid of a stain that never really\

HAND_GESTURES.label=Excessive Hand Gestures
HAND_GESTURES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just call out targets - he\

  \ {9, choice, 0#wave|1#waves}, and practically {9, choice, 0#mime|1#mimes} his battle strategies.\
  \ His lance jokes that if his radio ever goes down, he could probably still direct an entire skirmish\
  \ just with hand signals and exaggerated shrugs.
HAND_GESTURES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry can't give a briefing, tell a story, or even trash-talk\
  \ an enemy without animated, sweeping gestures. He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} nearly smacked his own\
  \ comrades more than once while explaining a maneuver mid-battle. He {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights}\
  \ just as expressively - every reload, every charge, every headshot somehow feels like it belongs\
  \ in an action holo.
HAND_GESTURES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's hands never stop moving - because if they do, he might\
  \ remember. Remember the times he couldn't signal for help, when orders were lost in the chaos,\
  \ when a simple gesture could've saved someone but didn't come in time. He {9, choice, 0#talk|1#talks}\
  \ with his hands because the alternative is letting them be still - and stillness brings nothing\
  \ but ghosts.
HAND_GESTURES.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just explain supply chain issues - he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#act|1#acts} them out. A shipment delay? He {9, choice, 0#throw|1#throws} his hands\
  \ skyward in exasperation. Budget cuts? He {9, choice, 0#pantomime|1#pantomimes} a knife slitting\
  \ a throat. The crew half-listens to his actual words, but they always get the message thanks to\
  \ his theatrics.
HAND_GESTURES.description.1.SUPPORT="Go left - no, left-left - okay, look, just follow my hand."\
  \ Barry's gesturing is so wild and exaggerated that sometimes people understand him less, not\
  \ more. His coworkers have learned to watch the gestures first and listen second.
HAND_GESTURES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's hands move constantly, tracing out stories, shaping\
  \ invisible diagrams, gesturing through explanations. But there's something in the way he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#hesitate|1#hesitates}, like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} trying to use them for\
  \ something else, something other than what they were made for - pulling triggers, closing airlocks,\
  \ writing names on casualty reports. The motions keep the past at bay. Barely.

HAND_WRINGER.label=Compulsive Hand-Wringer
HAND_WRINGER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry wrings his hands while waiting for battle to start,\
  \ during mission briefings, even mid-skirmish. He {9, choice, 0#see|1#sees} every possible way\
  \ things could go wrong and can't help but fret over them. His lance jokes that if he ever {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}\
  \ rubbing his hands together, that's when they should start panicking.
HAND_WRINGER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry double-checks his weapons, reviews the mission plan\
  \ again, and adjusts his gear obsessively - but no matter how prepared he {9, choice, 0#are|1#is},\
  \ his hands keep twisting together, like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} waiting for some unseen disaster.\
  \ The second the bullets start flying, though, the hand-wringing stops - because once the battle\
  \ begins, there's no time left to worry.
HAND_WRINGER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry wrings his hands because they remember. They remember\
  \ every mission gone wrong, every time he hesitated, every comrade he couldn't save. His fingers\
  \ trace scars, phantom pains from injuries long healed, from choices that never will. The war\
  \ might not have killed him yet, but it's taken pieces of him - one nervous motion at a time.
HAND_WRINGER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry isn't just responsible for his team - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ responsible for people. Every time he {9, choice, 0#hand|1#hands} out rations, ammo, or medical\
  \ kits, his hands twist together like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} wondering if it's enough. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} the numbers, but knowing doesn't make it easier when he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} to tell someone there's nothing left to give.
HAND_WRINGER.description.1.SUPPORT=It doesn't matter if it's a million-C-bill contract or a coffee\
  \ order, Barry agonizes over every decision. His hands wring as he {9, choice, 0#debate|1#debates}\
  \ between fuel allocations, payment schedules, or whether he should requisition one more crate of\
  \ emergency rations. "What if we need it later?" is his constant refrain, and no amount of reassurance\
  \ stops the fidgeting.
HAND_WRINGER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry wrings his hands not just in nervousness, but in guilt.\
  \ He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} the one who signs the orders. The one who makes the calculations - who\
  \ lives, who fights, who doesn't come back. The numbers say he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} making the\

  \ people to their deaths.

HANDSHAKE.label=Overly Enthusiastic Handshake
HANDSHAKE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just shake hands - he {9, choice, 0#grip|1#grips}\
  \ with both hands, {9, choice, 0#shake|1#shakes} firmly, and {9, choice, 0#hold|1#holds} on just a\
  \ little too long. "Good to meet you, friend! We're going to do great things together!" His\
  \ enthusiasm is infectious, but some recruits worry they've just signed an unspoken blood pact with\
  \ him.
HANDSHAKE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry seals deals, alliances, and battle plans with a handshake\
  \ that could crush fingers. "Damn good to have you on board!" he {9, choice, 0#boom|1#booms}, nearly\
  \ dislocating the arm of a junior officer. It's less a greeting and more an event, and somehow,\
  \ it actually makes people believe in him.
HANDSHAKE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry grips hands like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} afraid to let go,\
  \ like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} holding onto something real in a universe where people vanish in\
  \ an instant. His lance has seen it before - he {9, choice, 0#shake|1#shakes} hands like it might\
  \ be the last time. And too often, it is.
HANDSHAKE.description.0.SUPPORT="Welcome to the chaos!" Barry grins as he {9, choice, 0#shake|1#shakes}\
  \ a MekWarriors's hand so hard their whole torso moves. "Need anything? Ammo, armor, a replacement\
  \ heat sink? You just say the word!" No one can ever claim Barry lacks customer service skills...\
  \ if they can still feel their fingers afterward.
HANDSHAKE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's handshake is a statement, even when it really shouldn't\
  \ be. Meeting a high-ranking officer? He {9, choice, 0#pump|1#pumps} their hand like they're old\
  \ drinking buddies. Signing a delicate negotiation? He {9, choice, 0#shake|1#shakes} so hard it\
  \ nearly knocks over the paperwork. Everyone remembers meeting Barry - if only because their wrist\
  \ hurts afterward.
HANDSHAKE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's handshakes are too firm, too eager, too desperate. Like\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} making sure you know you exist, that you're real, that you're still here.\
  \ Because the last time he let someone go without a proper handshake, they walked into a battle\
  \ they didn't walk out of. And he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} been making up for it ever since.

HEADPHONES.label=Always Wearing Headphones
HEADPHONES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just go into battle - he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does}\
  \ it with a playlist. Whether it's heavy metal, modern symphonies, or classical rock, he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#swear|1#swears} the right song keeps him in the zone. His lance is used to seeing\
  \ him nodding along mid-skirmish, completely unfazed by the surrounding chaos.
HEADPHONES.description.1.COMBATANT=Whether he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} about to drop, in the repair bay,\
  \ or riding in a DropShip, Barry always has his headphones on. Always. No one knows what\

  \ everything else - until it's time to fight. Then, suddenly, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} hyper-focused,\
  \ like the world just synced to his personal rhythm.
HEADPHONES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't listen to music because he {9, choice, 0#enjoy|1#enjoys}\
  \ it. He {9, choice, 0#listen|1#listens} because if he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}, the silence\
  \ creeps in - the echoes of artillery, the screams over comms, the last words of people who didn't\

HEADPHONES.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry works like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} conducting an orchestra.\
  \ No one knows exactly what he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} listening to, but if his head starts bobbing,\
  \ it means things are getting done.
HEADPHONES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's headphones are a barrier. People argue? He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} hear it. Commanders complain about budgets? Not his problem.\
  \ Someone waves frantically for his attention? He {9, choice, 0#sigh|1#sighs}, reluctantly pulls\
  \ off one earpiece, and mutters, "This better be important."
HEADPHONES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry keeps his headphones on because music is the only thing\
  \ that still feels safe. He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen planets burn, heard the real sounds of war.\
  \ If he {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} the music playing, maybe - just maybe - he can pretend, for a\

HEALTHY_SNACKS.label=Frequently Snacking on Healthy Foods
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry treats combat like a sport, and fueling his body is part\
  \ of his routine. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} always chewing on protein bars, popping dried fruit\
  \ between drills, and downing electrolyte drinks like they're going out of style. His lance teases\
  \ him, but they don't complain when he {9, choice, 0#hand|1#hands} out energy-packed snacks that\
  \ keep them going during long deployments.
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry believes in balance. One moment he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ unloading an autocannon into an enemy vehicle, the next he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} peeling an orange\
  \ and offering vitamin-packed snacks to the team. "Hydration's key to peak combat performance," he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, handing a bottle of electrolyte water to a comrade who's still shaking\
  \ from adrenaline.
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't eat healthy because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} a\
  \ fitness nut - he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it ecause he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} what it's like\
  \ to have nothing. To go days without food, to feel his body weaken, to fight while running on empty.\
  \ He {9, choice, 0#stock|1#stocks} up, he {9, choice, 0#prep|1#preps}, he {9, choice, 0#control|1#controls}\
  \ his intake - because the day will come when the food runs out again. And this time, he'll be ready.
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry believes a well-fed crew is a functional crew. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#stock|1#stocks} supply depots with the best ration options, {9, choice, 0#grab|1#grabs}\
  \ fresh produce when he can get it, and constantly {9, choice, 0#remind|1#reminds} people to eat\
  \ real meals. If you need a snack, he'{9, choice, 0#vre|1#s} already got one on hand - just don't\
  \ ask for junk food.
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry is the one replacing coffee with herbal tea, swapping\
  \ ration packs for high-protein alternatives, and lecturing the unit about eating real food instead\
  \ of surviving on caffeine and spite. It's well-meaning... but after the third speech about\
  \ micronutrients, people start hiding their snacks.
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry stockpiles food, not out of paranoia, but because he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#remember|1#remembers}. The hunger, the desperation, the slow, creeping weakness of\
  \ not having enough. Even in times of plenty, he {9, choice, 0#stash|1#stashes} protein bars, dried\

HISTORIAN.label=Passionate about History
HISTORIAN.description.0.COMBATANT=Every skirmish, every engagement, every ambush reminds him of a\
  \ past war. "This is just like the Hesperus II siege, different scale, same mistakes," he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}, adjusting his sights. His lance has learned that whenever he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#start|1#starts} recounting military history mid-skirmish, it's either a sign of his\
  \ confidence - or a really bad omen.
HISTORIAN.description.1.COMBATANT=Tactical formations, famous last stands, the lineage of a\
  \ particular unit - he can recall all of it. One moment he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} breaking down the\
  \ enemy's battle doctrine, the next he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} casually mentioning that their insignia\
  \ has roots in some obscure rebellion from 2434. Most of his comrades don't mind - unless they're\
  \ trying to focus on not dying.
HISTORIAN.description.2.COMBATANT=Wars don't change, only the names and weapons do. Barry has\
  \ studied enough conflicts to know how units rise and fall, how every so-called unstoppable force\
  \ eventually collapses. His knowledge isn't inspiring - it's a weight. He {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights}\
  \ anyway, not because he {9, choice, 0#think|1#thinks} this time will be different, but because\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got no other choice.
HISTORIAN.description.0.SUPPORT=A simple request for replacement heat sinks can turn into a\
  \ twenty-minute lesson on old Terran engineering. Reviewing supply routes? Expect a tangent about\
  \ the logistical failures of the Rim War. Most of the company just nods along, secretly hoping\
  \ they'll retain at least one useful piece of trivia.
HISTORIAN.description.1.SUPPORT=Somewhere in Barry's personal storage are old reports, battlefield\
  \ maps, declassified documents, and a collection of paper books that would make a historian\
  \ jealous. If a military unit ever existed, he probably {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} about it. If\
  \ a planet ever hosted a battle, he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} the details. The trick isn't finding\
  \ information - it's escaping before he {9, choice, 0#tell|1#tells} the entire backstory.
HISTORIAN.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just study the famous battles - he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#memorize|1#memorizes} the names of those no one remembers. The warriors whose units\
  \ were wiped out, the commands that vanished, the colonies erased by war and never rebuilt. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#collect|1#collects} their stories because no one else will. Because one day,\
  \ someone will have to do the same for him.

HUMMER.label=Habitual Hummer
HUMMER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry is always humming - sometimes a marching cadence, sometimes\
  \ an old bar song, sometimes a melody no one else recognizes. It's not loud, just a quiet hum\
  \ over comms while he {9, choice, 0#line|1#lines} up a shot or waits for the next engagement. His\
  \ lance jokes that if he ever {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops} humming, that's when things have really gone bad.
HUMMER.description.1.COMBATANT=In the middle of a skirmish, with missiles flying and alarms\
  \ blaring, Barry is still humming. He {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it when charging, when bracing for\
  \ impact, even while dodging incoming fire. Some say it helps him focus. Others think\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} just a little too comfortable in the chaos. Either way, the tune never\
  \ stops - until the shooting does.
HUMMER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry hums to fill the silence where voices used to be. The\
  \ comrades who didn't make it back, the allies lost on distant battlefields, the old commanders\
  \ who once barked orders over the radio. If he {9, choice, 0#hum|1#hums} loud enough, maybe he won't\
  \ have to hear their ghosts whispering back.
HUMMER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry hums as he {9, choice, 0#take|1#takes} inventory, hums while\
  \ filling out manifests, hums while rerouting cargo through bureaucratic nightmares. The crew has\
  \ long since accepted that the low hum of an old war tune or a jaunty little ditty means Barry is\
  \ nearby - usually with a clipboard and a sarcastic comment.
HUMMER.description.1.SUPPORT=No matter where he {9, choice, 0#are|1#is}, Barry is always humming\
  \ something. It's never the same tune twice, and it's always just loud enough to be noticed.\
  \ Whether he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} reviewing documents or walking through the barracks, his\
  \ ever-present melody has become as much a part of the company as the sound of 'Mek repairs in the\
  \ hangar.
HUMMER.description.2.SUPPORT=The company has lost a lot - good pilots, steady contracts, entire\
  \ DropShips full of people who never made it back. Barry hums because silence is worse. Silence\
  \ means another mission failure. Silence means another name wiped off the roster. Silence means\
  \ they're next. If he {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} humming, {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} making some\
  \ kind of noise, maybe they're not done yet.

HYGIENIC.label=Obsessed with Hygiene
HYGIENIC.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry keeps his gear spotless, his weapons polished, and his\
  \ bunk smelling shockingly fresh. No matter how bad the battlefield gets, he {9, choice, 0#find|1#finds}\
  \ time to wipe down his visor and disinfect his gloves. His lance laughs, but when their weapons\
  \ jam from dust buildup and his fires clean, they start to reconsider.
HYGIENIC.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry refuses to drink from shared canteens, avoids touching\
  \ anything that hasn't been sanitized, and definitely has a stash of antiseptic wipes in every\
  \ pocket. "You think the enemy is the real threat?" he {9, choice, 0#scoff|1#scoffs}. "Try an untreated infection in the\
  \ middle of a contract." They joke that he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} over the top - until half the\
  \ lance goes down with dysentery, and Barry's the only one still standing.
HYGIENIC.description.2.COMBATANT=No amount of scrubbing can wash the blood from his hands. Barry\
  \ showers until his skin is raw, sterilizes his gear twice before every battle, and wipes down\
  \ every surface he {9, choice, 0#touch|1#touches}. He {9, choice, 0#tell|1#tells} himself it's\
  \ just habit, but deep down, he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} - no matter how hard he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#try|1#tries}, some stains never come out.
HYGIENIC.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry keeps his workspace pristine. Every surface is dusted,\
  \ every tool is disinfected, and no one touches the inventory without wearing gloves. "Clean\
  \ workspace, clean workflow," he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}, wiping down a perfectly spotless\
  \ terminal. The techs\ roll their eyes, but deep down, they appreciate not having to work in filth.
HYGIENIC.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has a very firm stance on personal cleanliness. Boots off\
  \ before entering the barracks, no eating near the control consoles, and absolutely no sneezing\
  \ without covering your mouth. If he had it his way, every MekWarrior would get decontaminated\
  \ before stepping into a cockpit. The commander refuses to humor him - but Barry still sprays down\
  \ every chair with disinfectant when no one's looking.
HYGIENIC.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry can't stop the war. He can't stop the deaths, the\
  \ betrayals, the slow rot of another command heading towards ruin. But he can keep his workspace\
  \ clean. He can scrub the blood from the floors. He can make sure that, if nothing else, his\
  \ hands don't feel dirty - even when the rest of him does.

IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.label=Unusual Sleep Patterns
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't follow a normal sleep cycle - he\

IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust sleep, not completely.\
  \ He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} the one pacing the perimeter at odd hours, tinkering with his gear at\

IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry sleeps in shifts that make no sense to anyone else -\

  \ somehow, the work is still finished on time.
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry treats sleep like an inconvenience. There's always\
  \ another report to file, another order to review, another detail to double-check. "I'll sleep\
  \ when things slow down," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says} - but things never slow down. His coworkers\
  \ have started making bets on when he'll finally pass out at his desk.
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.2.SUPPORT=Sleep isn't rest - it's vulnerability. It's time lost,\
  \ moments he  can't control, a gap in awareness where something can go wrong. Barry puts it off,\
  \ fights it, drinks stimulant-laced tea just to keep going a little longer. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#tell|1#tells} himself it's about efficiency, but deep down, he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows}\
  \ - when he finally crashes, he might not want to wake up again.

JOKER.label=Fond of Puns
JOKER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry cracks puns even in the heat of battle. "Looks like that\
  \ guy's having a meltdown," he {9, choice, 0#quip|1#quips} after overheating an enemy 'Mek. His\
  \ lance groans at his constant wordplay, but they can't deny it lightens the tension - just enough\
  \ to keep them steady when the situation turns grim.
JOKER.description.1.COMBATANT=Whether it's a skirmish, a stealth op, or a tense briefing,\
  \ Barry finds time for a pun. "Guess you could say we really blasted through that ambush," he\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says} with a wry grin, wiping soot off his armor. His lance has stopped\
  \ trying to stop him - it's better to let him get it out of his system and keep moving.
JOKER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's puns aren't just for fun - they're armor. Every terrible\
  \ joke, every groan-worthy remark is a way to push back against the constant dread of war. "We may\
  \ be fighting uphill, but at least we've got a peak advantage," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says} with\
  \ a wink. But smile never reaches his eyes.
JOKER.description.0.SUPPORT=Whatever Barry is doing, there's always a pun involved. His\
  \ colleagues roll their eyes, but even the most jaded warrior cracks a smile now and then.
JOKER.description.1.SUPPORT=The war never stops, the work never ends, but Barry finds a way\
  \ to make it just a little less awful. He {9, choice, 0#stick|1#sticks} pun-laden sticky notes on\
  \ schedules, makes groan-worthy jokes during routine maintenance, and ensures no report leaves his\
  \ desk without at least one bad pun. No one likes it - but no one really wants him to stop, either.
JOKER.description.2.SUPPORT=Every pun is forced, every joke just a little too loud. Barry keeps the\
  \ wordplay coming because if he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}, he'll have to face the reality of what\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} dealing with - the broken machines, the wounded warriors, the paperwork\
  \ documenting another casualty instead of another paycheck. "Looks like someone's having a rough\
  \ day," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, filling out another death report. The laugh that follows is\
  \ just a little too hollow.

LISTS.label=Compulsive List Maker
LISTS.description.0.COMBATANT=Before every mission, Barry has a list - objectives, fallback\
  \ positions, enemy strengths, even a checklist of which comrades owe him money from last week's\
  \ poker game. He {9, choice, 0#swear|1#swears} by his method, and given how rarely he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ caught off guard, his team is starting to believe he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} onto something.
LISTS.description.1.COMBATANT=Every battle, every skirmish, every contract has a plan. Barry\
  \ keeps a running list in his HUD - priority targets, terrain advantages, escape routes. "War is\
  \ just a series of problems to solve," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, adding a mental checkmark as\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#take|1#takes} down another enemy.
LISTS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry knows war is a mess - he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen friends die,\
  \ missions collapse, and too many unpredictable variables. So he {9, choice, 0#make|1#makes} lists.\
  \ Lists of enemies confirmed dead. Lists of the wounded. Lists of names he never {9, choice, 0#want|1#wants} to forget.\
  \ It doesn't stop the chaos, but at least on paper, it looks like something is under control.
LISTS.description.0.SUPPORT=It doesn't matter what he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} doing - Barry has a list\
  \ for it. Daily tasks? Listed. Emergency protocols? Color-coded and categorized. Someone asks him\
  \ about inventory? He {9, choice, 0#flip|1#flips} through his secondary list to cross-reference\
  \ the real list. No one knows how he {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} track of so much, but without him,\
  \ the whole operation would grind to a halt.
LISTS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't trust memory - he {9, choice, 0#trust|1#trusts} lists. Schedules, ration\
  \ allocations, critical injuries - if it matters, it's on a datapad or scribbled onto a notepad he\
  \ refuses to lose. "If it's not written down, it didn't happen," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says},\
  \ making another annotation that absolutely didn't need to be recorded but will come in handy later.
LISTS.description.2.SUPPORT=The lists are getting longer. More damaged equipment, more unpaid wages,\
  \ more missing personnel. Barry doesn't just track resources - he {9, choice, 0#track|1#tracks}\
  \ the decline. Every name marked "deceased," every supply line lost, every payment delayed. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} talk about it, but in the quiet hours, he {9, choice, 0#flip|1#flips}\
  \ through his notes, wondering when he'll have to add himself to the final list.

LITERAL.label=Overly Literal
LITERAL.description.0.COMBATANT="Cover me!" Barry's lance shouts, diving for cover. Barry,\
  \ standing still, replies, "Cover you with what? Suppressive fire? Smoke? A tarp?" While his lance\
  \ groans, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} already assessing precisely what they need - because in battle,\
  \ clarity matters.
LITERAL.description.1.COMBATANT="Take out that tank!" Barry pauses. "Do you mean destroy the\
  \ tank, or just disable it? Are we capturing it? Are we worried about collateral damage?" By the\
  \ time he {9, choice, 0#get|1#gets} his answers, the lance has already moved - but at least he\
  \ never he {9, choice, 0#misinterpret|1#misinterprets} a command.
LITERAL.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't use euphemisms. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} talk\
  \ about "eliminating hostiles" or "neutralizing threats." He {9, choice, 0#call|1#calls} it what it\
  \ is - killing. He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen too many people hide behind vague language, pretending\
  \ it makes war cleaner. He {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses}. War isn't clean. And he won't pretend\
  \ otherwise
LITERAL.description.0.SUPPORT="Barry, patch up that report." He {9, choice, 0#grab|1#grabs} a literal\
  \ patch kit. "Barry, hand me that tool." He places it directly in someone's palm. "Barry, fix this\
  \ system real quick." "Define quick," he responds, already pulling out a diagnostic report.\
  \ He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} not trying to be difficult - he just {9, choice, 0#need|1#needs} precision.
LITERAL.description.1.SUPPORT=If a contract says "supplies will be provided as available," Barry will\
  \ absolutely demand clarification on what "available" means. If a report says someone was "lost in\
  \ action," he will not accept it unless he {9, choice, 0#get|1#gets} clear details. It makes\
  \ negotiations painful - but it also prevents a lot of costly mistakes.
LITERAL.description.2.SUPPORT="How's the company holding up, Barry?" someone asks. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} sugarcoat it. "We've lost 32% of our working 'Meks, supply reserves\
  \ are critical, and we're two payroll cycles from insolvency." No one ever wants to hear his reports,\
  \ but Barry won't lie, won't soften the truth. Because in a world where everyone tries to mask the\
  \ inevitable, someone has to face it head-on.

LOCKS.label=Checks Locks Repeatedly
LOCKS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry double-checks every hatch, seal, and weapons locker before and\
  \ after deployment. "If you assume something's secure, that's when it isn't," he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters},\
  \ tugging at a latch one more time. His lance jokes that he'd probably check the JumpShip airlock\
  \ if they let him - but no one complains when his obsessive habits keep them alive.
LOCKS.description.1.COMBATANT=It doesn't matter if they're bunked down in a secure zone or camping\
  \ in enemy territory - Barry will always check every entrance, every lock, every secured weapon.\
  \ "You laugh now," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, rattling the latch again, "but the one time I\
  \ don't do this, we'll get jumped in our sleep."
LOCKS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry used to trust that locked doors stayed locked. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} anymore. He {9, choice, 0#remember|1#remembers} the time a door\
  \ didn't seal, the time an enemy slipped through unsecured defenses, the time someone he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#were|1#was} supposed to protect didn't make it. Now, he {9, choice, 0#check|1#checks}\
  \ every lock, every latch, every seal - because if something does go wrong, at least he'll know it\
  \ wasn't his fault this time.
LOCKS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry runs things like a fortress. If a locker is supposed to be locked,\
  \ he'll verify it three times. If a storage bay has security codes, he personally\
  \ {9, choice, 0#reset|1#resets} them. No one gets unauthorized access on his watch - partially\
  \ because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} paranoid, and partially because he really {9, choice, 0#enjoy|1#enjoys}\
  \ telling people no.
LOCKS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry always double-checks the locks. If someone says a door is sealed,\
  \ he'll check anyway. If someone insists an override is definitely disabled, he'll still run his\
  \ test. It's not personal - he just {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} better than to trust assumptions.
LOCKS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry locks things because he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} what happens\
  \ when you don't. He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen desperate refugees raid supply caches, saboteurs\
  \ slip into barracks, doors that should have held shattered when it mattered most. He can't control\
  \ the war, the contracts, the inevitable losses - but he can make sure that, for now, the doors stay\
  \ locked.

MEASURED_TALKER.label=Tends to Speak in a Measured Pace
MEASURED_TALKER.description.0.COMBATANT=No matter how intense the battle gets, Barry's voice never\
  \ wavers. He {9, choice, 0#deliver|1#delivers} orders with the slow, deliberate cadence of someone\
  \ who refuses to be rushed. "Adjust... thirty meters left... fire." His lance {9, choice, 0#swear|1#swears}\
  \ that hearing him on comms is almost calming - until they realize that if Barry's still speaking\
  \ that way, things must be even worse than they thought.
MEASURED_TALKER.description.1.COMBATANT=While others shout over each other, Barry waits. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#listen|1#listens}, {9, choice, 0#think|1#thinks}, then {9, choice, 0#speak|1#speaks}\
  \ carefully. "We engage now, we overextend. We wait ten seconds, we flank." He {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses}\
  \ to let adrenaline dictate his decisions, and while it frustrates more aggressive warriors, his\
  \ lance has learned to trust him.
MEASURED_TALKER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry used to talk faster, used to joke, used to care more.\
  \ Now, every word is deliberate, like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} trying not to waste them.\
  \ He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen too many people speak their last words before they even knew they'd\
  \ die. So now, he {9, choice, 0#speak|1#speaks} like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} making sure every\
  \ sentence matters. Because someday, he won't get another one.
MEASURED_TALKER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry talks like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} drafting a contract\
  \ in real time. Whether it's discussing orders, timelines, or options, every word is deliberate,\
  \ precise. No one ever walks away confused - but they do sometimes walk away wondering if they\
  \ just got outmaneuvered in a simple conversation.
MEASURED_TALKER.description.1.SUPPORT=When Barry explains a process, he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it\
  \ slowly, clearly, and with no room for misunderstanding. "You will disconnect the relay. You will\
  \ not touch the exposed wiring. If you do, you will die." Whether he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} training\
  \ rookies or giving mission updates, his methodical speech ensures that no one can claim they didn't\
  \ hear him.
MEASURED_TALKER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't raise his voice, doesn't rush his words, doesn't\
  \ waste breath. He {9, choice, 0#speak|1#speaks} with the weight of someone who has already\
  \ delivered bad news too many times. When he {9, choice, 0#tell|1#tells} a warrior, "You'll be\
  \ fine," they believe him. When he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, "There's nothing more I can do,"\
  \ they know he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} already tried everything.

MINIMALIST.label=Extreme Minimalism
MINIMALIST.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's kit is stripped down to the absolute essentials - no\
  \ extra ammo, no backup gear, no sentimental keepsakes. "More weight slows you down," he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, tightening the one pouch he {9, choice, 0#allow|1#allows} himself. His\
  \ lance teases him for it, but when they're struggling under overstuffed packs and\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} still moving, they start to reconsider.
MINIMALIST.description.1.COMBATANT=No unnecessary attachments, no redundant weapons, no fancy\
  \ tech. Barry keeps his loadout simple - because simple works. "You don't need a dozen backup\
  \ plans," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, securing his sidearm. "You need one that won't fail." It's\
  \ an efficient mindset, but some worry it's less about discipline and more about not wanting to get\
  \ attached to anything.
MINIMALIST.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry owns nothing he wouldn't be willing to leave behind. No\
  \ personal items, no extra gear, no home to return to. He {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} with what\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#carry|1#carries}, and if he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} to abandon it tomorrow,\
  \ he will. Because war takes everything eventually - better to live like you've already lost it all.
MINIMALIST.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in excess. Everything in his workspace is\
  \ accounted for and necessary. If it's not useful, it's gone. "Extra gear is just dead weight,"\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}, denying yet another request for nonessential items.\
  \ Efficiency isn't just a goal - it's the rule.
MINIMALIST.description.1.SUPPORT=No unnecessary tasks, no excessive reports, no overcomplicated\
  \ solutions. Barry patches what needs patching, nothing extra. "Good enough is good enough," he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, stepping back from another just-functional-enough fix. It keeps things\
  \ running - but some worry that one day, his definition of 'good enough' won't be enough.
MINIMALIST.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just live simply - he {9, choice, 0#remove|1#removes}\
  \ everything that doesn't serve a purpose. Personal items? A distraction. Extra gear? Just something\
  \ to lose. Relationships? Harder to let go of than supplies, but just as fleeting. If he only\
  \ {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} what's necessary, maybe it won't hurt so much when it all falls apart.

MUG.label=Prefers Using a Specific Mug
MUG.description.0.COMBATANT=Before every mission, Barry drinks from his mug. Doesn't matter if it's\
  \ coffee, tea, or a protein shake - it only counts if it's in the same battered, slightly dented,\
  \ and thoroughly stained cup. His lance doesn't question it. Given how many battles\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} survived, they figure it might actually be lucky.
MUG.description.1.COMBATANT="The shape keeps the liquid at the optimal temperature," Barry\
  \ insists, sipping from his one and only mug. "The handle has perfect weight distribution." He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to use any other cup, even if it means rinsing it out in\
  \ battlefield runoff before pouring another drink. His lance has long since accepted that the mug\
  \ goes wherever he {9, choice, 0#go|1#goes}.
MUG.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's favorite mug has been with him longer than most of his comrades.\
  \ He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} left planets behind, lost equipment, abandoned people - but this remains.\
  \ Barry doesn't talk about where he got it or why he won't replace it. He just {9, choice, 0#hold|1#holds}\
  \ it a little tighter on the nights when the war feels particularly close.
MUG.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry keeps things running like clockwork, but if anyone so much as touches\
  \ his mug, they're in for a lecture. "You want coffee? Fine. You don't use this mug."\
  \ He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} signed off on impossible job lists without blinking, but the day someone\
  \ borrowed his mug? That was a crisis.
MUG.description.1.SUPPORT=There could be an emergency, a full company deployment, a reactor on fire\
  \ - but Barry will not start work without drinking from his one mug. "Things function better with\
  \ consistency," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, taking another sip. The fact that he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#talk|1#talks} about his mug the same way he {9, choice, 0#talk|1#talks} about people\
  \ is concerning.
MUG.description.2.SUPPORT=The bunk, the uniform, the gear - it all belongs to the company. It all\
  \ changes with every contract, every deployment. But his favorite mug? That mug is his. The one\
  \ thing that hasn't been replaced, reassigned, or lost to war. If he ever {9, choice, 0#lose|1#loses}\
  \ it, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} not sure what will be left of him.

NAIL_BITER.label=Constant Nail Biter
NAIL_BITER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't flinch under fire, doesn't panic when missiles\
  \ rain down - but his fingers tell a different story. His nails are jagged, bitten down to near\
  \ nothing, the casualty of endless waiting, briefing delays, and long hours in the scrum. It's\
  \ not fear, he {9, choice, 0#insist|1#insists}. Just something to do while the next battle looms.
NAIL_BITER.description.1.COMBATANT=Mid-skirmish, mid-strategy meeting, mid-conversation - Barry's\
  \ fingers are always near his mouth, absentmindedly gnawed as he {9, choice, 0#think|1#thinks}.\
  \ "Barry, stop biting your damn nails," someone mutters over comms. A second of silence, then:\
  \ "Huh? Oh. Right." It lasts maybe five minutes before he {9, choice, 0#start|1#starts} again.
NAIL_BITER.description.2.COMBATANT=His hands shake after missions, so he {9, choice, 0#bite|1#bites}\
  \ his nails. It gives him something to focus on, something small to control when everything else\
  \ spirals beyond his grasp. If his fingers are raw, if his nails are ruined - well, at least it's\
  \ proof he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} still here. At least it's his own damage, not someone else's.
NAIL_BITER.description.0.SUPPORT=His job is a battlefield of its own, and Barry feels every\
  \ engagement. Inventory shortages, delayed shipments, missing tools - each issue gets a little more\
  \ nail chewed away. "We're short on fusion coolant again?" he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters},\
  \ biting the edge of his thumbnail. If he had an intact fingernail left, it would be a miracle.
NAIL_BITER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry works fast, his brain running just ahead of his hands, his\
  \ teeth worrying at his nails between quick jobs. "Hold still, almost done - just let me - "\
  \ crunch. The nervous habit doesn't slow him down, but his workspace is often slick with antiseptic\
  \ from another self-inflicted cut.
NAIL_BITER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't talk about his stress. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}\
  \ lash out, {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} break things, {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} complain.\
  \ Instead, his nails are bitten down to raw, torn messes, silent proof of the pressure grinding\
  \ him down. It's the only thing he {9, choice, 0#allow|1#allows} himself - the only wound\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} willing to show.

NICKNAMING.label=Frequent Nicknaming
NICKNAMING.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry almost never calls his teammates by their actual names.\
  \ The rookie pilot? 'Hotshot.' The team's allocated tech? 'Sparky.' The commander? 'Big Boss.'\
  \ Half the unit has stopped correcting him, because by the time they do, he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s}\
  \ already come up with another one.
NICKNAMING.description.1.COMBATANT="Alright, Trash Panda, you take point. Princess, you cover the\
  \ left flank. Trouser Snake, you-" "Barry, I swear, stop calling me that." But Barry doesn't stop.\
  \ Ever. Once you're assigned a nickname, it sticks. If you don't like it? Too bad. That just makes\
  \ him say it more.
NICKNAMING.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry hands out nicknames like candy. It's easier than\
  \ remembering real names - because real names come with memories. With losses. With faces he'd\
  \ rather not picture when he {9, choice, 0#try|1#tries} to sleep. As long as they're 'Deadeye' or\
  \ 'Hellhound' or 'Bulldozer', he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} have to think about how many real\
  \ names he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} already forgotten.
NICKNAMING.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in titles. The lead mechanic is 'Grease,'\
  \ the MedTech is 'Patches,' and the newest recruit is 'Grass' until they earn something better.\
  \ It's all part of the company's culture now - at this point, even he probably {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}\
  \ remember their real names.
NICKNAMING.description.1.SUPPORT=Everyone who works with Barry gets a nickname, and once he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#assign|1#assigns} one, it's yours for life. The problem? They don't always make\
  \ sense. "Hey, 'Wires,' pass me that wrench." "Barry, I'm not an electrician." "Don't argue with\
  \ me, Wires." The name sticks. It always sticks.
NICKNAMING.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry gives out names because it means someone sees you. Military\
  \ units burn through people fast - warriors, techs, medics, clerks. Most of them get a number on a\
  \ payroll log and little else. But if Barry calls you 'Chief' or 'Rookie' or 'Grimlock,' it means\
  \ you existed. Even if only for a little while.

NIGHT_OWL.label=Night Owl
NIGHT_OWL.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry is at his best when the sun's down. While the rest of the\
  \ lance struggles through late-night operations, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} fully alert, reacting\
  \ faster, making sharper calls. "Midnight raids, night drops, stealth ops? That's my time to shine,"\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, adjusting his visor. Some wonder if he even {9, choice, 0#sleep|1#sleeps}\
  \ - or if he just {9, choice, 0#wait|1#waits} for daylight to pass.
NIGHT_OWL.description.1.COMBATANT=While the lance sleeps, Barry patrols, cleans his gear, and tweaks\
  \ his HUD. "Somebody's gotta be awake," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, sipping yet another cup of\
  \ cold, bitter coffee. He {9, choice, 0#insist|1#insists} it's not paranoia - he just\
  \ {9, choice, 0#prefer|1#prefers} the quiet, the way the battlefield feels different under starlight.
NIGHT_OWL.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry stays up not because he {9, choice, 0#want|1#wants} to, but\
  \ because sleep brings things he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} want to see. Memories of burning\
  \ cities, last words over broken comms, the slow count of friends he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} lost.\
  \ The night is quiet. And if he {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} his eyes open long enough, maybe he\
  \ won't have to dream at all.
NIGHT_OWL.description.0.SUPPORT=If you need something from Barry, better check after midnight -\
  \ because that's when he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} actually working. Inventory manifests? Updated at\
  \ 03:00. Reports? Submitted right before dawn. The company has learned to just roll with it. "You\
  \ can do this at a normal time, you know." "Yeah, but I won't."
NIGHT_OWL.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's tools are always in motion long after everyone else has\
  \ passed out. Diagnostics, late-night assignment overhauls, last-minute job lists? That's when he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#get|1#gets} his best work done. "No distractions, no idiots asking questions - just\
  \ me and the machines," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, taking a sip of something that definitely\
  \ isn't just coffee.
NIGHT_OWL.description.2.SUPPORT=The company's debts. The worn-out equipment. The empty beds of\
  \ warriors who aren't coming back. Barry stays awake long after the others sleep, because someone\
  \ has to see it, to witness the slow collapse. He won't talk about it, won't wake anyone up - but\
  \ every night, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} there, staring at the ceiling, wondering how much longer\
  \ it'll last.

NOTE_TAKER.label=Compulsive Note-Taking
NOTE_TAKER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry keeps a small, weathered notebook strapped to his gear.\
  \ Enemy movements, ammo counts, battle formations - if it happens, he {9, choice, 0#write|1#writes}\
  \ it down. Some joke that he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} trying to become a war historian, but when his\
  \ notes reveal enemy patterns before command does, no one's laughing.
NOTE_TAKER.description.1.COMBATANT=Every briefing, every engagement, every conversation - Barry is\
  \ writing. Notes in a datapad, shorthand scribbled on the back of his glove, coordinates scratched\
  \ into the inside of his bunk. "Memory's unreliable," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, flipping through\
  \ pages of previous battles. "Records last."
NOTE_TAKER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry writes names. He {9, choice, 0#write|1#writes} dates. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#write|1#writes} everything because he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen too many people\
  \ vanish without a trace. No records. No burial. Just gone. So he {9, choice, 0#record|1#records}\
  \ them, their stories, their moments - because in a war where people disappear overnight, maybe\
  \ this way, they'll still exist.
NOTE_TAKER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's logs are legendary. Every job, every tool, every assignment\
  \ is recorded somewhere. "Paper trails save lives," he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}, flipping\
  \ through his notes to prove - again - that the last batch of supplies was signed out three days\
  \ ago. No one ever wins arguments with Barry.
NOTE_TAKER.description.1.SUPPORT=Every shift, every report, every single action Barry takes gets\
  \ documented and his notes are meticulous. If someone asks for a status update, he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} speak - he {9, choice, 0#hand|1#hands} them a log entry with\
  \ timestamps, materials used, and a breakdown of everything that happened.
NOTE_TAKER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry keeps too many notes. Not just equipment statuses and\
  \ mission briefings, but the slow decay of everything around him. Fuel shortages. Unpaid wages.\
  \ The steady reduction of names in the payroll log. One day, someone will look back at his\
  \ records and see exactly when the company started dying. But for now, only he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ paying attention.

NOTEBOOK.label=Always Carrying a Notebook
NOTEBOOK.description.0.COMBATANT=Enemy formations, heat sink efficiency, which comrade still\
  \ owes him money - Barry documents it all. His notebook is crammed with mission notes, tactical\
  \ sketches, and half-finished thoughts written in hurried shorthand. "If I forget, it's my fault.\
  \ If I write it down, it's fact."
NOTEBOOK.description.1.COMBATANT=While others rely on intuition, Barry checks his notes. "Last\
  \ time we fought a force like this, they favored a pincer maneuver," he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters},\
  \ flipping back through pages. Some scoff at his reliance on old scribbles - until they realize his\
  \ predictions are almost always right.
NOTEBOOK.description.2.COMBATANT=Names of fallen comrades. Coordinates of battles no one\
  \ remembers. A tally of shots fired, 'Meks destroyed, debts unpaid. Barry writes it all down\
  \ because if he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}, it'll be like it never happened. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} trust history to remember the truth. That's his job.
NOTEBOOK.description.0.SUPPORT=No matter what someone needs Barry has it written down. "I\
  \ logged that two weeks ago," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, flipping through pages, already finding\
  \ the answer before anyone else even thinks to check a terminal. His system isn't digital, but it\
  \ never fails.
NOTEBOOK.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't rely on memory. Every job requested, every\
  \ procedure performed, every minor incident - all of it goes in the notebook. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} always explain why he {9, choice, 0#record|1#records} so much, but\
  \ if someone asks, he simply says, "Because someone has to."
NOTEBOOK.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's notebook isn't just logs - it's a record of decline.\
  \ Ration cuts, missing payments, the names of warriors who never came back. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#write|1#writes} it all because no one else does. Because someday, the company will\
  \ fall apart completely. And someone should at least remember how it happened.

OBJECT.label=Carries a Personal Object
OBJECT.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry never enters battle without his one personal item - a lucky\
  \ coin, a worn-out playing card, a patch from an old uniform. "You don't mess with luck," he\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, tucking it into his pocket before every mission. Whether it actually\
  \ helps or not, his lance knows better than to question it.
OBJECT.description.1.COMBATANT=In the chaos of war, Barry keeps one thing constant. Maybe it's\
  \ a trinket from home, maybe it's something given to him by someone long gone. It doesn't matter\
  \ what it is - what matters is that it's his. When the battle's over and the adrenaline fades, he\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#grip|1#grips} it tight, reminding himself that he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} still\
  \ here.
OBJECT.description.2.COMBATANT=The object in Barry's possession isn't sentimental - it's\
  \ survival. A reminder of who he used to be, of a promise he couldn't keep, of a person he once\
  \ knew. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} talk about it, {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} let anyone\
  \ touch it, {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} explain why he {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to\
  \ part with it. Some wounds don't bleed, but they never heal either.
OBJECT.description.0.SUPPORT=Whether it's a well-worn multitool, an old pocket watch, or a\
  \ scrap of a long faded photo, Barry's always carrying something familiar. "You gotta have\
  \ something of your own in a job like this," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}. No one knows where he\
  \ got it, but they know he'd notice immediately if it ever went missing.
OBJECT.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's job changes, his location changes, the people around him\
  \ change - but one thing never does. That personal item, the thing always tucked into a pocket,\
  \ clipped to his belt, or hidden inside his jacket. It's not about sentimentality. It's about\
  \ having something that stays the same.
OBJECT.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't keep his special object because it makes him happy. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} it because it reminds him of what's been lost. A tag from a dead\
  \ comrade, a ring from a life left behind, a torn page from a book he never got to finish. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} talk about it. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} need to. Anyone\
  \ who looks into his eyes when he holds it already understands.

ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.label=Obsessive Tendencies
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just follow orders - he perfects them.\
  \ Whether it's drilling a maneuver until it's second nature or recalibrating his weapon for the\
  \ third time in an hour, he won't stop until every variable is accounted for. His lance teases him\
  \ for being too precise - until they see him land a shot no one else could make.
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.1.COMBATANT=If an enemy gets away, Barry remembers. If a battle\
  \ doesn't go exactly as planned, he {9, choice, 0#analyze|1#analyzes} it endlessly. His obsession\
  \ with what should have happened keeps him awake at night, scribbling notes and running scenarios.\
  \ The lance tells him to let it go, but deep down, they know - his fixation makes him dangerous.
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's obsessiveness isn't just habit - it's\
  \ desperation. He can't stop tweaking his loadout, refining battle plans, checking his gear again\
  \ and again - because the moment he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}? The moment he {9, choice, 0#trust|1#trusts}\
  \ things to go as expected? That's when people die. And he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} already lost too\
  \ many.
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just do his job - he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#master|1#masters} it and {9, choice, 0#triple-check|1#triple-checks} everything.\
  \ "There is no such thing as an acceptable margin of error," he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}\
  \ while going over numbers again. Others may get frustrated with his constant rechecking, but they\
  \ also know - if Barry says it's right, it's right.
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.1.SUPPORT=No matter the task Barry refuses to call something\
  \ finished until it meets his impossibly high standards. "It's fine," someone tells him. "No," he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#reply|1#replies}, making one last adjustment. "It's correct." The rest of the team\
  \ has learned to let him work - because once he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} satisfied, the job is done\
  \ right.
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's attention to detail isn't about perfection -\
  \ it's about control. He can't stop the war. He can't stop people from dying. But he can make sure\
  \ that this form is filed correctly. Because if he ever {9, choice, 0#let|1#lets} his mind wander\
  \ to the things he can't fix, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} not sure he'll come back from it.

ORGANIZER.label=Always Organizing
ORGANIZER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's gear is always perfectly arranged - pants folded, boots\
  \ cleaned and stored in exact order, emergency rations packed in a precise grid. His lance teases\
  \ him about it, but when they need something fast in the middle of a fight, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ the one who always knows where to find it.
ORGANIZER.description.1.COMBATANT=Before every battle, Barry insists on running a final check.\
  \ Formation assignments? Confirmed. Backup comms? Verified. Extraction routes? Plotted and\
  \ re-plotted. "The battlefield is messy enough," he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}. "No reason we\
  \ have to be." The others may roll their eyes, but when things go wrong, his plans are why they\
  \ make it out alive.
ORGANIZER.description.2.COMBATANT=War is disorder, destruction, entropy. Barry fights back the\
  \ only way he can - by making sure his world stays structured. His clothes are perfectly aligned in\
  \ his locker. His boots are arranged at precise angles. His gear is exactly where it needs to be.\
  \ Because if he ever {9, choice, 0#let|1#lets} the chaos creep in, he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows}\
  \ it'll take more than just his equipment - it'll take him, too.
ORGANIZER.description.0.SUPPORT=It doesn't matter if he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} relaxing, performing\
  \ his duties, or handling reports - Barry makes sure everything is where it's supposed to be. Files?\
  \ Sorted. Tools? Arranged by frequency of use. Supplies? Restocked and labeled. No one questions his\
  \ methods anymore - because when they need something fast, Barry already has it ready.
ORGANIZER.description.1.SUPPORT=A cluttered workspace? Unacceptable. A jumbled manifest? Unthinkable.\
  \ If Barry walks into a messy storage room, he will reorganize it. "I don't care if you know where\
  \ everything is," he {9, choice, 0#snap|1#snaps}, shifting crates into a more logical layout. "I'll\
  \ know where it is, and it'll make sense." The others sigh, but they also know - his system works.
ORGANIZER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry can't stop the war. He can't save everyone. But he can make\
  \ sure the medical kits are stocked, the equipment is sorted, the files are in perfect order. If\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#control|1#controls} the little things, maybe - just maybe - it'll feel like he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} control over something. Because deep down, he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows}:\
  \ no amount of organization can stop the unit from falling apart.

ORIGAMI.label=Fond of Origami
ORIGAMI.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry spends downtime folding scraps of paper into precise,\
  \ intricate shapes. Battle maps, ration packaging, even old mission reports - nothing is safe from\
  \ his hands. His lance laughs, but there's something unnervingly methodical about the way he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#crease|1#creases} each fold, like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} applying the same focus\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} to killing.
ORIGAMI.description.1.COMBATANT=No one knows when Barry does it, but somehow, there's always a\
  \ small paper crane, fox, or star waiting near his bunk, inside DropShips maintenance panels, or\
  \ tucked into the ammo crates. "Figure if we're always breaking things," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}\
  \ with a shrug, folding another, "I might as well make something for a change."
ORIGAMI.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's hands are steady in combat, but after the fight, when\
  \ the dust settles and the dead are counted, they start to tremble. So he {9, choice, 0#fold|1#folds}.\
  \ One precise crease at a time, one careful movement after another, until the shaking stops. It\
  \ doesn't erase what he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} done. But for a moment, it feels like\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} creating something instead of destroying it.
ORIGAMI.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's paperwork is always impeccable - and folded. Orders come\
  \ with little paper animals. Logs arrive with tiny folded lotuses attached. No one asks why he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it, but no one throws them away, either.
ORIGAMI.description.1.SUPPORT=Long shifts, tight deadlines, and endless problems - Barry copes\
  \ by folding. A few seconds between tasks, a break between work cycles, even during long\
  \ meetings, his fingers move, folding something small, something precise. It doesn't interfere\
  \ with his work. If anything, it seems to help him focus.
ORIGAMI.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't know if anyone will remember him when this is all\
  \ over. The company, the contracts, the war - it all grinds people down, leaves no trace of them\
  \ behind. But maybe, just maybe, one of his paper cranes will still be sitting on a shelf long\
  \ after he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} gone. Maybe that's enough.

OVER_PLANNER.label=Obsessive Over-Planner
OVER_PLANNER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just have a battle plan - he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has}\
  \ twelve. If the enemy flanks, if they get pinned down, if weather conditions shift unexpectedly\
  \ - he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} already thought it through. His lance used to roll their eyes at his\
  \ paranoia, but after surviving one too many ambushes thanks to Barry's foresight, they don't\
  \ complain anymore.
OVER_PLANNER.description.1.COMBATANT=Before the mission even begins, Barry has already memorized the\
  \ terrain, accounted for ammo reserves, and assigned every comrade a secondary role in case the\
  \ plan goes sideways. "You think too much," someone mutters. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}\
  \ argue. Thinking too much is why he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} still alive.
OVER_PLANNER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry remembers the battles that went wrong. The ones where no\
  \ one planned for an enemy counterattack, where the extraction route collapsed, where people died\
  \ because no one thought ahead. Now, he {9, choice, 0#plan|1#plans} for everything. If he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#cover|1#covers} every angle, maybe he won't have to carve another name into the\
  \ side of his helmet.
OVER_PLANNER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's plans aren't just good - they're flawless. Every task is\
  \ mapped with maximum efficiency, every request is cross-checked with projected future needs.\
  \ "You can't just plan for today," he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}, marking another contingency\
  \ on his datapad. "You have to plan for six months from now."
OVER_PLANNER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry refuses to let anything be left to chance. He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s}\
  \ mapped out every possible outcome, every risk, and probably has a backup plan for his backup plan.\
  \ No one argues with him anymore - not because they agree, but because he always {9, choice, 0#win|1#wins}.
OVER_PLANNER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry plans too much because he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} what\
  \ happens when people don't. The battle they weren't ready for. The wounded they didn't have enough\
  \ supplies for. The time he {9, choice, 0#weren't|1#wasn't} fast enough, smart enough, prepared\
  \ enough to stop what was coming. So now, he {9, choice, 0#plan|1#plans} for everything. Because if\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#miss|1#misses} something again, he might not be able to live with it.

OVEREXPLAINER.label=Chronic Overexplainer
OVEREXPLAINER.description.0.COMBATANT="Barry, what's the plan?" Instead of a quick response, his\
  \ lance gets every possible detail. Terrain conditions, enemy positioning, historical precedent\
  \ for similar battles. By the time he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} done explaining, the fight has already\
  \ started.
OVEREXPLAINER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just call out targets - he {9, choice, 0#explain|1#explains} why they're the\
  \ priority. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} just suggest a strategy - he details every reason it works. His lance\
  \ appreciates the thought, but sometimes they just want to hear "Shoot that guy" instead of a\
  \ five-minute breakdown of flanking maneuvers.
OVEREXPLAINER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry used to assume orders were clear. Then he watched people\
  \ die because they weren't. Now, he {9, choice, 0#explain|1#explains} everything, over and over,\
  \ ensuring there's zero room for misinterpretation. It makes him insufferable. But if it saves even\
  \ one more life, he can live with that.
OVEREXPLAINER.description.0.SUPPORT="You want more supplies? Let me explain the supply chain\
  \ constraints affecting that." Barry doesn't just approve or deny requests - he {9, choice, 0#break|1#breaks}\
  \ down why certain items are in short supply, how much fuel it takes to move them, and how much worse\
  \ it could be. No one asks for clarification anymore because it never ends.
OVEREXPLAINER.description.1.SUPPORT=Need something done? Barry will absolutely do it - but not before\
  \ explaining exactly why it needed to be done, how it should be prevented, and the entire history\
  \ of the problems like this. "Barry, can you just do it?" "Yes, but first, you need to understand\
  \ the problem."
OVEREXPLAINER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry explains everything because if he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}\
  \ talking, he might have to think. About the war. About how many people he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s}\
  \ known up who didn't make it. About the numbers on the payroll sheet that keep shrinking. So he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#fill|1#fills} the silence with words, drowning out the thoughts he\

PEN_CLICKER.label=Habitual Pen Clicker
PEN_CLICKER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's pen clicks in steady rhythm while he processes a battle\
  \ plan, studies an enemy formation, or reviews battlecam footage. Click. Click. Click. It's not\
  \ nerves - it's focus. His lance knows that if the clicking stops, it means he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s}\
  \ either figured something out - or something's about to go very wrong.
PEN_CLICKER.description.1.COMBATANT=It doesn't matter if he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} in a war room, a\

  \ "Do you have to do that?" someone groans during a mission briefing. "Yes," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says},\
  \ still clicking. The others don't believe him, but he never {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}.
PEN_CLICKER.description.2.COMBATANT=The battlefield is chaos. Orders shift, people die, plans fall\
  \ apart - but Barry's pen still clicks, a tiny, steady noise in the storm. Click. Click. Click. A\
  \ reminder that he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} still here, still thinking, still in control of something.\
  \ If he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}, he might have to face the things he can't control. And that's\
  \ not an option.
PEN_CLICKER.description.0.SUPPORT=Every request, every review, every inventory count - click, click,\
  \ click. Barry doesn't even realize he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} doing it. But if you hear the rapid-fire\
  \ clicking of a pen, you know he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} deep in thought, solving a problem no one\
  \ else has noticed yet.
PEN_CLICKER.description.1.SUPPORT=Meetings, briefings, payroll discussions - Barry's pen clicks\
  \ through all of them. "You're driving me insane," someone mutters. "Am I?" Click. No one has\
  \ been brave enough to steal the pen yet, but the betting pool on who tries first is growing.
PEN_CLICKER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's pen is always in motion, always clicking, because if it\
  \ isn't, his hands start to shake. If he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}, the silence creeps in,\
  \ bringing thoughts he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} want. So he {9, choice, 0#click|1#clicks}. He {9, choice, 0#click|1#clicks}\
  \ while signing off reports. He {9, choice, 0#click|1#clicks} while logging another failed task.\
  \ He {9, choice, 0#click|1#clicks} because if he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}, he might not start\

PEN_TWIRLER.label=Habitual Pen Twirler
PEN_TWIRLER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's fingers are always in motion, twirling a pen with the\
  \ same precision he {9, choice, 0#use|1#uses} to fire a weapon. His lance swears he could take down\
  \ an enemy just by flicking it hard enough. If the pen stops moving, it means he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ actually paying attention - and that's when people start getting nervous.
PEN_TWIRLER.description.1.COMBATANT=It doesn't matter if he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} in a briefing,\
  \ riding in a DropShip, or crouched behind cover while autocannons roar overhead - Barry's pen\

  \ spinning it again without looking.
PEN_TWIRLER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry keeps his hands busy because if they stop, his mind\
  \ wanders. Back to the names he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} crossed out. Back to the missions that went\
  \ wrong. So he {9, choice, 0#spin|1#spins} the pen. Over and over. Faster. Slower. Anything to keep\
  \ his fingers moving, to keep the silence from creeping in.
PEN_TWIRLER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just process requests - he {9, choice, 0#perform|1#performs}\
  \ them, flipping a pen through his fingers while rattling off numbers. Spin. Catch. Somehow, he\

PEN_TWIRLER.description.1.SUPPORT=Whether he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} filling out paperwork,\
  \ troubleshooting, or giving a report, Barry's pen never stops spinning. "That's going to fly out\
  \ of your hand one day," someone says. "Not today," he {9, choice, 0#reply|1#replies}, flipping it\
  \ behind his back and catching it without looking.
PEN_TWIRLER.description.2.SUPPORT=The numbers keep getting worse. The casualty lists keep getting\
  \ longer. The debts pile up, the supplies run low, the repairs take longer every time. Barry\
  \ can't fix it all, but he can spin their pen, keep it moving, keep something predictable in a\
  \ universe that refuses to be.

PERSONIFICATION.label=Overly Friendly with Equipment

PERSONIFICATION.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's comrades keep dying. His gear? It stays. So he\

PERSONIFICATION.description.0.SUPPORT="Alright, my beauties, let's see what we've got today," Barry\

PERSONIFICATION.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry used to joke with his team. Used to trade stories, give\

PESSIMIST.label=Habitual Pessimist
PESSIMIST.description.0.COMBATANT="We're walking into a trap," Barry mutters as the mission\

  \ was too easy," he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters} while reviewing logs. "Nothing ever works this\
  \ well. Either we missed something, or something's about to hit the fan." No one takes him seriously\
  \ - until he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} right. Again.
PESSIMIST.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry wasn't always like this. He used to hope. Used to think\
  \ things might turn around. Then he counted too many empty bunks, saw too many names vanish from\
  \ payroll, lost too many shipments that never arrived. Now? He just assumes the worst. It's\
  \ easier that way. At least it means he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} never surprised.

PHRASES.label=Tends to Use Specific Phrases
PHRASES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's lance can predict his responses before he even\
  \ {9, choice, 0#speak|1#speaks}. "This is gonna suck." "If I die, delete my debts." "Oh great,\
  \ another suicide mission." His catchphrases aren't just habit - they're a coping mechanism. When\
  \ everything else is chaos, at least his words stay the same.
PHRASES.description.1.COMBATANT="A bad plan executed well beats a good plan executed poorly."\
  \ "Information is ammunition!" "Nobody wins in war, they just get to fight the next one." Barry's\
  \ phrases aren't original, but they stick. New recruits pick them up without realizing it, until\
  \ suddenly they're repeating his words on the battlefield.
PHRASES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry wasn't always like this. His phrases? They weren't his\
  \ first. Some belonged to comrades who aren't around anymore. Some were last words. Some were\
  \ muttered over comms, half-forgotten in the haze of war. He {9, choice, 0#say|1#says} them because\
  \ if he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}, those people are truly gone.
PHRASES.description.0.SUPPORT="Do I look like a magician?" "You want it done when? Hah."\
  \ "Sure, I'll pull that out of my magic supply crate full of things we don't have." Barry has a\
  \ standard rotation of responses to requests, all variations of 'You're not getting what you\
  \ want.'
PHRASES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has his go-to lines. "Not my problem - until it is." "You\
  \ break it, you buy it." "This wasn't in my job description, and yet, here I am." At this\
  \ point, his coworkers just accept it as part of the job.
PHRASES.description.2.SUPPORT="It'll hold." "We'll figure something out." "Things'll work\
  \ out." Barry repeats the same reassurances over and over, not because he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#believe|1#believes} them, but because it's what people need to hear. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} the truth. But saying it wouldn't help anyone, least of all himself.

PLANTS.label=Loves Plants
PLANTS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's gear is always pristine, his sidearm well-maintained - right\
  \ next to a small potted plant he {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} in his bunk. "Everything else in\
  \ this job dies," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, misting its leaves. "Might as well keep one thing\
  \ alive." His lance teases him, but they've also learned not to mess with the plant.
PLANTS.description.1.COMBATANT="That's a snake plant. Tough as hell, doesn't need much,\
  \ survives in low light. Kind of like us." Barry's the type to compare a campaign to crop\
  \ rotation and an ambush to invasive species competition. His lance has learned to just nod along\
  \ when he {9, choice, 0#start|1#starts} explaining plant biology mid-patrol.
PLANTS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has taken so many lives. Bombed forests, scorched\
  \ farmland, turned green fields into battlefields. So he {9, choice, 0#grow|1#grows} plants - not\
  \ to balance the scales (nothing could), but to remind himself that creation is still possible.\
  \ That not everything has been reduced to ash.
PLANTS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's storage room isn't just crates and tools - it's also full\
  \ of plants. "They help with air quality," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, watering a row of\
  \ succulents next to a rack of medical supplies. Everyone lets it slide because, honestly? It\
  \ does make the place feel less miserable.
PLANTS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry always finds time to check his plants. "You're looking\
  \ real good today, Lt. Lavender," he murmurs to a sprouting seedling. His coworkers have long since\
  \ stopped questioning it - unless they catch him slipping the plants extra water rations (again).
PLANTS.description.2.SUPPORT=Plants don't fight. They don't betray. They don't die screaming.\
  \ Barry grows them because they're simple. Because in a life where everything falls apart,\
  \ they're the only thing that doesn't ask anything of him. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} expect\
  \ to survive this war. But maybe, just maybe, his plants will.

POLITE.label=Excessive Politeness
POLITE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry thanks the quartermaster when he {9, choice, 0#pick|1#picks} up his ammunition,\
  \ apologizes when he {9, choice, 0#shoot|1#shoots} an enemy, and says "excuse me" when shoving\
  \ someone out of the way of an incoming missile. His lance doesn't understand how he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#manage|1#manages} to be so polite while covered in blood and dust, but at this\
  \ point, it's just his thing.
POLITE.description.1.COMBATANT="Pardon me, but I believe that's my cover." "Terribly sorry,\
  \ but I am about to fire at you." Barry's enemies don't know how to handle the fact that\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} alarmingly courteous while actively trying to kill them. His lance swears\
  \ that one day, an enemy will surrender just because they feel bad for interrupting his manners.
POLITE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry says "please" and "thank you" because everything else\
  \ about his life is brutal. The orders, the fighting, the constant death - none of it feels right.\
  \ But if he can still show some basic decency, if he can still be civilized, then maybe he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#haven't|1#hasn't} lost himself to the war completely.
POLITE.description.0.SUPPORT="I do regret to inform you that we are completely out of spare\
  \ batteries, and I deeply apologize for any inconvenience this may cause." Barry speaks like\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} declining a dinner invitation. Somehow, his tone makes it even more\
  \ frustrating.
POLITE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's manners never drop. He {9, choice, 0#refer|1#refers} to rookies\
  \ as "sir" and "ma'am," always prefaces bad news with deeply formal condolences, and thanks people\
  \ for their patience - even when they definitely don't have any.
POLITE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry knows how cruel the world is. He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen what\
  \ happens when people stop caring, stop being human. So he {9, choice, 0#cling|1#clings} to formality,\
  \ to pleasantries, to basic courtesy. He {9, choice, 0#bow|1#bows} his head when passing the dead,\
  \ murmurs "I'm so sorry" when patching up another wounded warrior. If he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}\
  \ being polite, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} afraid of what he'll become.

PRACTICAL_JOKER.label=Loves Practical Jokes
PRACTICAL_JOKER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry takes warfare very seriously - right up until the moment he\
  \ tapes over someone's targeting reticle with a tiny, smiling skull sticker. His lance knows that\
  \ if things have been too quiet, someone is about to find their personal comms blasting\
  \ MekWarrior recruitment jingles in the middle of battle.
PRACTICAL_JOKER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry rigs the barracks door to announce everyone's full rank\
  \ and name when they enter. He swaps someone's comm ID so they sound exactly like the unit\
  \ commander. Even in the middle of a war, he {9, choice, 0#find|1#finds} ways to make people laugh\
  \ - because sometimes, that's the only thing keeping them from breaking.
PRACTICAL_JOKER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry pranks because if he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops},\
  \ he'll have to process the horror around him. Every practical joke is a distraction, a way to keep\
  \ things light even when the air feels like death. The day Barry stops joking is the day his lance\
  \ knows things have truly gone to hell.
PRACTICAL_JOKER.description.0.SUPPORT=Here's your mission briefings, and a surprise!" Barry grins as\
  \ a warrior opens the box to find a single bright pink paint can labeled 'EXPERIMENTAL CAMO.'\
  \ He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} mastered the art of harmless, mildly infuriating pranks - but never\
  \ enough to get himself actually fired.
PRACTICAL_JOKER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry reroutes coffee machine settings so they all dispense\
  \ decaf, rearranges locker labels just slightly, and convinces rookies that "JumpShip gravity\
  \ loss training" involves sprinting toward a bulkhead wall. No one's safe - but somehow, they all\
  \ love him for it.
PRACTICAL_JOKER.description.2.SUPPORT=The budget's failing. People are dying. Morale is nonexistent.\
  \ Barry keeps joking because someone has to. Someone has to keep something light in a world that\
  \ only gets darker. Because the moment no one laughs at his pranks anymore... that's when he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} it's really over.

PREPARED.label=Always Prepared
PREPARED.description.0.COMBATANT=Need extra ammo? Barry already packed it. Medkit? Right here.\
  \ Contingency for if the mission inevitably goes sideways? He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got a plan.\
  \ His lance has learned that if Barry tells them to carry an extra power cell, they don't ask why\
  \ - they just do it.
PREPARED.description.1.COMBATANT="Check your seals. Check your ammo. Check everything twice,"\
  \ Barry reminds his team every deployment. He {9, choice, 0#aren't|1#isn't} paranoid -\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} survived enough bad situations to know that being unprepared is just\
  \ another way of asking to die.
PREPARED.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry isn't just prepared - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} ready for\
  \ everything. Because he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen what happens when people aren't. The last time\
  \ someone forgot to check their equipment, they didn't come back. The last time a lance got sloppy,\
  \ they left a graveyard behind. He won't make those mistakes. He can't afford to.
PREPARED.description.0.SUPPORT="You're gonna want an extra medkit," Barry says, handing it over\
  \ before the MekWarrior even asks. "How did you - ?" "Because I know you." His ability to\
  \ anticipate needs borders on psychic. No one questions it.
PREPARED.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry never leaves anything to chance. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}\
  \ just have a backup plan - he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} three. "Hope for the best," he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}, sealing another redundant supply crate, "but prepare for the worst."
PREPARED.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry stocks extra bandages because he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} watched\
  \ people bleed out when there weren't enough. He {9, choice, 0#double-check|1#double-checks} oxygen\
  \ reserves because he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen what suffocation looks like. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#prepare|1#prepares} not because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} cautious - but because he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} what happens when you're not.

PUNCTUAL.label=Overly Punctual
PUNCTUAL.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry isn't just on time for deployments - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ early. While the rest of the lance rolls in groggy and adjusting their gear, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ already double-checking his weapons, reviewing the mission plan, and glaring at anyone who thinks\
  \ "five minutes late" is acceptable.
PUNCTUAL.description.1.COMBATANT="Being late is the fastest way to get killed." Barry drills it\
  \ into every rookie he {9, choice, 0#meet|1#meets}. In war, seconds matter - hesitate, delay, miss\
  \ your mark, and you're dead. His lance jokes that he {9, choice, 0#set|1#sets} his watch five\
  \ minutes fast just to make sure he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} never late. They're only half wrong. It's\
  \ ten minutes.
PUNCTUAL.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry once showed up late to a fight. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}\
  \ talk about what happened afterward, but his lance didn't walk away intact. Now, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ never late. Never behind. Never a second off schedule. Because if he {9, choice, 0#are|1#is}, it\
  \ means someone else might not make it. And he {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to let that happen\
  \ again.
PUNCTUAL.description.0.SUPPORT=If Barry says a report will be ready at 06:00, it's ready at 06:00.\
  \ Not a second later. Anyone who dares show up late for a job gets the look - the one that\
  \ says you are now the reason my entire system is off by 45 seconds, and I will remember this.
PUNCTUAL.description.1.SUPPORT=Every shift, every meeting, every single task in Barry's day\
  \ runs exactly on schedule. If he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says} a task takes 32 minutes, it takes 32\
  \ minutes. "It's about efficiency," he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters} as he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#check|1#checks} his watch for the third time in a minute. His coworkers have learned\
  \ that if you're late, you might as well not show up at all.
PUNCTUAL.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry is never late because if he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} always busy,\
  \ always moving, always on schedule, he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} have to think about the\
  \ people who are never showing up again. He {9, choice, 0#fill|1#fills} his time,\
  \ {9, choice, 0#control|1#controls} it down to the second, because if he ever {9, choice, 0#let|1#lets}\
  \ himself fall behind, he might start remembering what he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} lost.

PUZZLES.label=Obsessed with Puzzles
PUZZLES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he {9, choice, 0#analyze|1#analyzes}. Enemy\
  \ formations, terrain advantages, supply lines - it's all one giant puzzle waiting to be unraveled.\
  \ "Every problem has a solution," he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}, adjusting his sights. The\
  \ only question is whether he {9, choice, 0#find|1#finds} it before someone gets killed.
PUZZLES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry can't not try to break things down. He {9, choice, 0#spend|1#spends}\
  \ downtime solving riddles, tweaking battle plans, or picking apart mission briefings like they're\
  \ crossword clues. "It's just a simple recon op, Barry." He {9, choice, 0#shake|1#shakes} his head.\
  \ "That's what they want you to think."
PUZZLES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry needs to solve puzzles, because once, he couldn't. A\
  \ battle gone wrong, a mystery that cost lives, a decision that left him with too many empty\
  \ chairs around the table. Now, he {9, choice, 0#piece|1#pieces} things together obsessively,\
  \ trying to prove to himself that there's always a way out - he just {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} to\
  \ find it in time.
PUZZLES.description.0.SUPPORT=Managing his tasks isn't just a job for Barry - it's a game. Every\
  \ day is another piece in the ever-changing puzzle of how to keep the company running. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} ust solve problems - he {9, choice, 0#anticipate|1#anticipates} them.
PUZZLES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry can't resist a puzzle. "Barry, we need those power cells\
  \ moved." "Sure thing - oh, but look at this encryption key, someone tried to hide something\
  \ here..." His coworkers have learned to either give him puzzles on purpose or rip them out of his\
  \ hands before he {9, choice, 0#get|1#gets} lost in them.
PUZZLES.description.2.SUPPORT=A shipment lost, another contract failed, another person missing\
  \ from the roster. Barry can't fix those things. But he can decrypt an old DropShip manifest, or\
  \ solve an old Terran cipher. He {9, choice, 0#focus|1#focuses} on the puzzles he can solve so he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} have to think about the ones he never will.

QUOTES.label=Collects Quotes
QUOTES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry has a quote for everything. Before a mission? "Fortune\
  \ favors the bold." After losing a comrade? "War does not determine who is right, only who is\
  \ left." Some find it inspiring. Others wish he'd just shut up and fight.
QUOTES.description.1.COMBATANT="Alexander once said-" "Barry, please." Whether it's an ancient\
  \ philosopher or a forgotten MekWarrior, he always {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} a quote to fit the\
  \ situation. His lance tolerates it because, somehow, his endless library of words actually makes\
  \ them think.
QUOTES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just collect quotes - he {9, choice, 0#cling|1#clings}\
  \ to them. They're the words of people who survived, who understood the world before him. Repeating\
  \ them means he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} have to come up with his own answers. Because if he\
  \ did, he might have to admit he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} have any left.
QUOTES.description.0.SUPPORT="Request approved. 'walk softly and carry a big gun.'" Every\
  \ document Barry signs comes with an extra line of borrowed wisdom. No one's sure why he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it, but it's hard to be mad when a report arrives exactly as promised,\
  \ with just the right words attached.
QUOTES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry always has a quote ready. "A stitch in time saves nine."\
  \ "No plan survives first contact with the enemy." He {9, choice, 0#insist|1#insists} they're\
  \ relevant. His coworkers suspect he just {9, choice, 0#enjoy|1#enjoys} the theatrics.
QUOTES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry writes down quotes because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} afraid the\
  \ voices of the past will disappear. Commanders, poets, warriors - they all left something behind.\
  \ Something worth remembering. Because if their words can last, maybe - just maybe - something\
  \ about him will, too.

RARELY_SLEEPS.label=Rarely Sleeps
RARELY_SLEEPS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry claims he can't sleep. "Too much to do, not enough time,"\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}, rubbing exhaustion from his eyes. Yet somehow, despite the\
  \ late nights and early deployments, he never {9, choice, 0#miss|1#misses} a mission. His lance\
  \ doesn't know how he {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} going, but they're starting to think he might not,\
  \ for much longer.
RARELY_SLEEPS.description.1.COMBATANT="Sleep is for people who don't have things to worry about." Barry\
  \ is up before dawn, checking weapons, analyzing enemy movements, running drills in his head.\
  \ "You should sleep, Barry." "So should you," he fires back.
RARELY_SLEEPS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry closes his eyes and sees them - the dead, the battles gone\
  \ wrong, the faces of those who won't be in the next deployment. So he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}\
  \ sleep. He just {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} moving, {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} planning,\
  \ {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} doing something, because the moment he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops},\
  \ the memories will catch up.
RARELY_SLEEPS.description.0.SUPPORT=Need something at 3 AM? Barry's already awake. No one knows when\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#sleep|1#sleeps}, only that he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} always at his desk, fixing\
  \ problems before anyone else even notices them. "Barry, go to bed." "Bed's more of a suggestion\
  \ than a location."
RARELY_SLEEPS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry treats sleep as optional. "We've got deadlines." "We've\
  \ got a mission." "We've got so much work to do." He {9, choice, 0#push|1#pushes} himself harder\
  \ than anyone else and {9, choice, 0#get|1#gets} frustrated when others can't keep up. Not because\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} angry - because if Barry needs sleep, that means he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ doing something wrong.
RARELY_SLEEPS.description.2.SUPPORT=Sleep is surrender. Sleep is vulnerability. Sleep is trusting\
  \ that when he {9, choice, 0#wake|1#wakes} up, everything won't have collapsed overnight. Barry\
  \ doesn't trust that anymore. He {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} moving, {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps}\
  \ working, {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} doing something, because stopping? Stopping means realizing\
  \ just how bad things really are.

ROUTINE.label=Has a Routine for Small Tasks
ROUTINE.description.0.COMBATANT=Before every battle, Barry follows the same sequence: adjusts his\
  \ gloves twice, tightens his straps in the same order, taps his helmet once. "Superstition?"\
  \ someone asks. "No," he {9, choice, 0#reply|1#replies}. "Just making sure everything's right."\
  \ But his lance knows - if his routine is ever disrupted, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} off his game.
ROUTINE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry preps his weapons the exact same way before every\
  \ mission. Field strips, recalibrates, reloads-even if they don't need it. "Why do you keep doing\
  \ that?" someone asks. He {9, choice, 0#shrug|1#shrugs}. "Routine keeps you sharp." What he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}\
  \ say? Without it, the battlefield feels too unpredictable.
ROUTINE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has to do things in order-check gear, stretch, reload,\
  \ adjust his HUD, breathe. If he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}? The battlefield feels wrong. War\
  \ is chaos, loss, failure. But if he can control one thing, just one, maybe it'll be enough to\
  \ keep himself together.
ROUTINE.description.0.SUPPORT=No one interrupts Barry's process. Supply check at 06:00. Ration\
  \ logs at 07:30. Gear inspections exactly at 11:00. Any change to the order? Unacceptable. "Barry,\
  \ can't you skip a step?" "No," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says} flatly, already organizing another\
  \ routine.
ROUTINE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has an unbreakable routine. "It's efficient," he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}. But if someone tries to rush him, he still {9, choice, 0#stick|1#sticks}\
  \ to his routine. "Break the order," he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}, "and that's when things\
  \ go wrong."
ROUTINE.description.2.SUPPORT=The company is bleeding resources. The pay is late. Another bunk\
  \ is empty. Barry can't stop the decline, but he can follow his routines. If the paperwork is\
  \ done just right, if the tools are placed exactly where they belong, if he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does}\
  \ everything in perfect sequence-maybe it'll feel like things aren't slipping away.

SEEKS_APPROVAL.label=Constantly Seeking Approval
SEEKS_APPROVAL.description.0.COMBATANT=Every time Barry lands a shot or executes an order, his eyes\
  \ flick toward his lance. "Good call, right?" "That was the right move, yeah?" He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ skilled, damn skilled, but he still {9, choice, 0#need|1#needs} to hear it-{9, choice, 0#need|1#needs}\
  \ someone to confirm that he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} doing the right thing.
SEEKS_APPROVAL.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry knows what he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} doing, but he still\
  \ {9, choice, 0#ask|1#asks}. "You sure about this plan?" "We're really going in now?" He won't\
  \ commit until someone gives him a nod, a pat on the shoulder, anything to prove he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ not messing up. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} not afraid of battle - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} afraid\
  \ of disappointing someone.
SEEKS_APPROVAL.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen what happens to warriors who fail. The ones who\
  \ weren't good enough. The ones who made the wrong call. The ones whose names are scratched off\
  \ the roster and never spoken again. So he {9, choice, 0#ask|1#asks}-constantly, obsessively -\
  \ because if no one tells him he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} doing well, maybe he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ next.
SEEKS_APPROVAL.description.0.SUPPORT="I got everything squared away ahead of schedule - was that\
  \ helpful?" "I prioritized the tool shipments over the rations - was that the right call?" Barry\
  \ knows he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} efficient, but he still {9, choice, 0#need|1#needs} someone to\
  \ tell him he made the right decision.
SEEKS_APPROVAL.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has a report ready to go, job fully handled, and manifests\
  \ double-checked-but he won't submit anything without someone approving it first. "Just want to\
  \ make sure it's right," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, waiting for a nod before proceeding. It\
  \ slows things down, but he can't help it.
SEEKS_APPROVAL.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't ask for validation because he {9, choice, 0#enjoy|1#enjoys}\
  \ it - he {9, choice, 0#ask|1#asks} because he {9, choice, 0#need|1#needs} it. Because in a world\
  \ where people disappear overnight, where names get wiped off records like they never existed, he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} to hear that he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} useful. That he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ needed. Because if he {9, choice, 0#aren't|1#isn't}, then what's keeping him from vanishing next?

SENTIMENTAL.label=Overly Sentimental
SENTIMENTAL.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's locker is full of small, seemingly insignificant\
  \ items - a spent shell casing from his first battle, a scrap of fabric from an old unit patch, a\
  \ dented dog tag that isn't his. "They're just reminders," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says} when asked.\
  \ Reminders of what, he never {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}.
SENTIMENTAL.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry names his weapons, personalizes his armor, and refuses to\

  \ breaks him a little more each time.
SENTIMENTAL.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry refuses to throw anything away-every scrap, every\
  \ trinket, every memory means something. Because war erases people. It wipes them out. And if he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} hold onto what little remains, who will?
SENTIMENTAL.description.0.SUPPORT="This laser's been with us since the second campaign. It's our\
  \ emotional support laser. You do not just toss it aside." Barry treats old gear with reverence,\
  \ patching up damaged equipment long past its prime because it deserves better than to be scrapped.
SENTIMENTAL.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry remembers birthdays, keeps old rosters even when people\
  \ are long gone, and still refers to former coworkers like they just left. "They were good\
  \ people," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, voice a little too soft. "They mattered."
SENTIMENTAL.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has a list. Names of every warrior he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s}\
  \ known, every MedTech who's patched the crew up, every mechanic who's worked on their gear. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#read|1#reads} it sometimes, whispering each name like a prayer. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} to remember them - because someday, there won't be anyone left who does.

SHARPENING.label=Compulsive Sharpening
SHARPENING.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry isn't just prepared - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} precise.\
  \ Every knife, or tool in his kit is honed to perfection. He {9, choice, 0#sharpen|1#sharpens} his\
  \ combat blade before every mission, during downtime, and even mid-briefing. His lance jokes that\
  \ he'd sharpen a laser if he could.
SHARPENING.description.1.COMBATANT=When Barry isn't in battle, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} sitting with\
  \ a whetstone, running it over the edge of his blade again and again. It doesn't matter if it's\
  \ already sharp - he {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} at it anyway. It's not about the blade. It's about\
  \ the motion, the control, the focus. His team has learned that if Barry's sharpening in silence,\
  \ it's best to leave him be.
SHARPENING.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry can't control the war. He can't stop people from dying.\
  \ But he can make sure his knife is sharp. Every pass of the stone, every adjustment to the\
  \ angle - it's something tangible, something real, something that won't fail him. Because in a\
  \ universe where everything else falls apart, at least his blade will always be ready.
SHARPENING.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry insists that everything stays sharp. Knives? Obviously.\
  \ Tools? Absolutely. A can opener? You bet. He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} been caught sharpening wrenches\
  \ before, and no one knows if he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} serious or if he just {9, choice, 0#need|1#needs}\
  \ to keep something in motion.
SHARPENING.description.1.SUPPORT=Whether he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} fixing equipment, sorting supplies,\
  \ or handling a task, Barry always has something in his hands, sharpening it absentmindedly. "Barry,\
  \ is that a machete?" "Yep." "Why are you sharpening it?" He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} answer.\
  \ He just {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} going.
SHARPENING.description.2.SUPPORT=The war grinds people down, but Barry grinds a steely knife. If his\
  \ hands are busy, his mind isn't dwelling on the latest casualty report, the missing shipments, the\
  \ debts stacking up. So he {9, choice, 0#sharpen|1#sharpens}. And {9, choice, 0#sharpen|1#sharpens}.\
  \ And {9, choice, 0#sharpen|1#sharpens}. Because if he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}, the thoughts\

SINGS.label=Sings to Themselves
SINGS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry sings softly, barely audible over the crackle of comms.\
  \ It's an old war tune, a bar song, or some half-forgotten melody from a planet he barely\
  \ {9, choice, 0#remember|1#remembers}. The lance knows that if they hear him singing, the fight\
  \ hasn't really started yet. If he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}? That's when things have gone bad.
SINGS.description.1.COMBATANT="Barry, why are you singing right now?" "Because it helps me\
  \ focus." It doesn't matter if they're pinned down or charging into an ambush - Barry always has a\
  \ song under his breath, a slow and steady rhythm that somehow makes the chaos around him seem a\
  \ little more manageable.
SINGS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry sings because silence means remembering. It means thinking about\
  \ the battles he barely survived, the people who didn't, the wreckage left behind. The melody keeps\
  \ those thoughts at bay, drowns out the ghosts whispering in the quiet. If he ever {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}\
  \ singing, it's because there's no one left to sing for.
SINGS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry works to a tune, humming as he clears the rota, whistling while\
  \ fixing manifest errors, occasionally breaking into full song when the numbers actually balance\
  \ for once. No one's sure if he even realizes he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} doing it, but at this point,\
  \ his coworkers consider it part of the daily routine.
SINGS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry hums constantly. Sometimes it's an old folk song, sometimes it's\
  \ entirely made up, but it's always there. "It helps me concentrate," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}.\
  \ His coworkers don't mind - it makes the long shifts feel a little less empty.
SINGS.description.2.SUPPORT=The war grinds people down. Names disappear from rosters, beds go empty,\
  \ another late-night report comes in full of losses. Barry sings because if he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops},\
  \ he'll have to process it all. As long as the song keeps going, so does he.

SKEPTICAL.label=Chronically Skeptical
SKEPTICAL.description.0.COMBATANT="Smooth operation, minimal resistance," the commander says.\
  \ Barry scoffs. "Uh-huh. And I suppose the enemy didn't get the memo?" He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ heard too many promises of 'easy missions' that turned into bloodbaths. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} assume disaster - he just {9, choice, 0#prepare|1#prepares} for\
  \ it every time.
SKEPTICAL.description.1.COMBATANT="We're supposed to trust intel from who?" Barry demands, arms\
  \ crossed. If a plan sounds too clean, he {9, choice, 0#assume|1#assumes} it's wrong. If an enemy\
  \ retreats too fast, he {9, choice, 0#assume|1#assumes} they're baiting them in. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ not paranoid, he {9, choice, 0#insist|1#insists} - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} just still alive.
SKEPTICAL.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry trusts no one - not command, not locals, not even his own\
  \ allies completely. Too many times, the people he relied on turned out to be lying, compromised,\
  \ or already dead. So now? Now he {9, choice, 0#assume|1#assumes} everything is a trick until\
  \ proven otherwise.
SKEPTICAL.description.0.SUPPORT="The shipment's 'on schedule?' Sure, I'll believe it when I see\
  \ it." Barry assumes every delivery is late, every contract is skewed, and every report is\
  \ missing critical details. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} never pleasantly surprised - but\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} also never unprepared.
SKEPTICAL.description.1.SUPPORT="The convoy's fine? The system's stable? Uh-huh, sure." Barry\
  \ checks everything twice, then once more just in case. If someone insists a problem is solved,\
  \ he immediately {9, choice, 0#assume|1#assumes} it isn't. His coworkers roll their eyes - until\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#catch|1#catches} an issue they swore wasn't there.
SKEPTICAL.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's been told things would get better. That command would\
  \ come through. That there was enough time, enough resources, enough hope. None of it was true.\
  \ So now, he {9, choice, 0#trust|1#trusts} nothing at face value. Because the one time he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#do|1#does}? That's when it'll all come crashing down.

SLEEP_TALKER.label=Talks in Sleep
SLEEP_TALKER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's lance has learned not to bunk near him unless they want\
  \ to hear a full mission replay at 3 AM. "Take the flank - no, not that way! Damn it-" He barks\
  \ commands, mutters tactics, and sometimes lets out a low chuckle - like he just won a fight that\
  \ never happened.
SLEEP_TALKER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry sleeps, but his brain doesn't. He {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}\
  \ coordinates, lists off supply counts, or recites mission orders word for word. "Barry, you were\
  \ telling us where to take cover in your sleep." He {9, choice, 0#shrug|1#shrugs}. "Yeah? And was I wrong?"
SLEEP_TALKER.description.2.COMBATANT=Sometimes Barry's voice is barely a whisper. Names. Places.\
  \ Pleas. Things that shouldn't be heard. Those who wake up and listen know better than to mention\
  \ it in the morning. Because whatever he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} remembering? It's something he can't\
  \ let go of.
SLEEP_TALKER.description.0.SUPPORT="Check the manifests. Who authorized that last shipment?" Barry\
  \ doesn't just talk in his sleep - he {9, choice, 0#work|1#works} in it. His bunkmates have stopped waking him up,\
  \ choosing instead to write down his half-conscious ramblings, just in case he {9, choice, 0#catch|1#catches} something\
  \ they missed.
SLEEP_TALKER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's nighttime mumbling is half-practical, half-nonsense. One\
  \ night it's "Gotta fix that...," the next it's "Why is the DropShip full of goats?" No one\
  \ knows what his brain is doing, but it's oddly fascinating to listen to.
SLEEP_TALKER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't talk about certain things while awake. But when\
  \ sleep takes him, his mind leaks-regrets, confessions, fears. "Should've been me." "We never\
  \ should've trusted them." "There's no way out of this, is there?" His coworkers pretend they\
  \ don't hear. Because what could they possibly say?

SMILER.label=Compulsive Smiler
SMILER.description.0.COMBATANT=Incoming fire? Barry smiles. A brutal melee? He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ grinning. No one knows if it's nerves, confidence, or just something deeply wrong with him, but\
  \ when the fight gets ugly, his smile only gets wider. His lance isn't sure whether it's reassuring\
  \ or deeply unsettling.
SMILER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry jokes, grins, and cracks a smirk even when things are\
  \ falling apart. "Barry, we're pinned down." Smile. "Barry, command just abandoned us." Grin.\
  \ "Barry, what the hell is so funny?" "Nothing," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, still smiling.\
  \ "What else can we do?"
SMILER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't feel like smiling - he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} to.\
  \ The moment he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}, the moment his face falls, it all becomes real. The\
  \ losses, the hopelessness, the sheer weight of it all. So he {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} grinning,\
  \ even when his hands shake, even when there's blood on his teeth. Because if he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}, what's left?
SMILER.description.0.SUPPORT=Supplies are running low, requests are piling up, another lance isn't\
  \ coming back - but Barry's still smiling. "Don't worry, we'll figure it out," he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, flashing a grin that's just a little too forced. No one believes him.
SMILER.description.1.SUPPORT=Broken equipment, impossible deadlines, an infuriating lack of\
  \ cooperation - Barry just smiles through it all. "Barry, you're really calm about this." "Oh,\
  \ absolutely," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says} through clenched teeth, his grin unwavering as he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#contemplate|1#contemplates} murder.
SMILER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry grins even when the walls are closing in, even when the\
  \ company's debts are unpayable, even when another casualty report crosses his desk. "You're\
  \ always smiling," someone says. "Yeah," Barry replies, still grinning. "Because what happens if\
  \ I stop?"

SNACKS.label=Always Has a Snack
SNACKS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry fights like a professional, but he {9, choice, 0#eat|1#eats}\
  \ like it's just as important. Mid-mission? Ration bar. Briefing? Dried fruit. In the scrum? Protein\
  \ paste. His lance used to think it was weird - until they hit a 16-hour engagement and realized\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#were|1#was} the only one still functioning.
SNACKS.description.1.COMBATANT="Barry, how are you eating right now?" someone shouts as\
  \ bullets whiz overhead. "Gotta keep my energy up," he {9, choice, 0#reply|1#replies}, taking\
  \ another bite of something that definitely shouldn't have survived this long in a combat zone. No\
  \ one understands how he does it - but he never runs out.
SNACKS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry eats because it's routine. Because it's something normal\
  \ in a world that isn't. Because if he {9, choice, 0#focus|1#focuses} on unwrapping a snack, just\
  \ for a moment, it's not about the bodies, the losses, the blood. It's just food. And if he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}? He might start feeling everything else.
SNACKS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry is personally stocked for any situation. "Long shift?\
  \ Here, have a protein bar." "Supply delay? I planned for that." His pockets are full of snacks,\
  \ and if you need one, he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got you covered.
SNACKS.description.1.SUPPORT=Explosions outside? Critical system failures? Late-night emergency job\
  \ requests? Doesn't matter - Barry's still eating. "How can you think about food right now?"\
  \ someone asks. He {9, choice, 0#shrug|1#shrugs}, chewing. "Because starving won't fix it either."
SNACKS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry always eats, even when no one else can stomach it. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#chew|1#chews} as he {9, choice, 0#sigh|1#sighs} off another casualty report. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#nibble|1#nibbles} on dried meat as he {9, choice, 0#calculate|1#calculates} supply\
  \ losses. Because if he {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} eating, {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} living\
  \ like normal, then maybe - just maybe-things aren't as bad as they look.

STORYTELLING.label=Compulsive Storytelling
STORYTELLING.description.0.COMBATANT="This reminds me of the time we got stuck on an ice world with\
  \ no working weapons and one functional sock..." Barry launches into another tale mid-battle,\
  \ dodging fire as he {9, choice, 0#talk|1#talks}. His lance swears he'd narrate his own death if\
  \ given the chance.
STORYTELLING.description.1.COMBATANT="You ever hear about the warrior who took down a 'Mek bare-handed?"\
  \ Barry asks, grinning. "No? Well, let me tell you..." He exaggerates just enough to keep things\
  \ entertaining - but never enough to be sure he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} lying.
STORYTELLING.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just tell stories - he {9, choice, 0#preserve|1#preserves}\
  \ them. The names of fallen comrades, the battles no one recorded, the choices that led to who\
  \ lived and who didn't. If he {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} talking, if he {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps}\
  \ telling, then maybe they're not really gone.
STORYTELLING.description.0.SUPPORT="You want more food? That reminds me - back in the Skye conflict,\
  \ a guy exactly like you asked for extra rations. You know what happened next?" By the time Barry\
  \ hands over the request, the poor warrior's heard a five-minute anecdote.
STORYTELLING.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry narrates everything. "This reminds me of a time we had a\
  \ busted coolant line exactly like this - except that time, the guy next to me caught fire..." His\
  \ coworkers have learned to just let him talk.
STORYTELLING.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry collects tales of the past - because someone has to. The\
  \ contracts lost, the MekWarriors who never came back, the deals that went south. If he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops} talking, if he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops} telling these stories,\

  \ happen.

STRETCHING.label=Constantly Stretching
STRETCHING.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's always stretching - before a mission, during briefings,\
  \ even mid-battle. "A stiff body's a slow body," he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}, rolling his\
  \ shoulders. He {9, choice, 0#treat|1#treats} combat like a sport - one wrong movement, one cramp\
  \ at the wrong time, and it could cost him his life.
STRETCHING.description.1.COMBATANT="Barry, we're about to breach the enemy position." Pop - crack -\
  \ stretch. "Yeah, just gimme a sec." His lance groans as he twists his torso, arms over his head,\
  \ preparing like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} about to jog a marathon instead of charge into gunfire.
STRETCHING.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry stretches because it's something to control. Muscles\
  \ loosen, joints adjust, everything works the way it's supposed to. Unlike his past mistakes.\
  \ Unlike the ghosts he {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} running from. His body has to be ready - because\
  \ if it ever locks up, so will he.
STRETCHING.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just handle tasks - he {9, choice, 0#prepare|1#prepares}\
  \ for them. Before getting to work, before checking manifests, before signing a single form, he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#stretch|1#stretches}. "Gotta stay loose," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, rolling\
  \ his neck before approving a basic request.
STRETCHING.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry never stops flexing. "You good, Barry?" "Yup, just loosening\
  \ up." Pop. Crack. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} so used to stretching that his coworkers suspect he'd\
  \ cramp up instantly if he ever stopped.
STRETCHING.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just stretch - he {9, choice, 0#need|1#needs} to. The\
  \ stress, the exhaustion, the pressure - his body takes it all in. So he {9, choice, 0#move|1#moves},\
  \ {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} things loose, because if his joints lock up, he might realize just\
  \ how much damage he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} actually taken.

SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.label=Suspicious Rituals
SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.0.COMBATANT=Before every mission, Barry finds a quiet spot, kneels,\
  \ and draws something into the dirt. If no dirt is available, he scratches it into metal plating\
  \ or marks it with a grease pen. No one knows what the symbol means, and when asked, he just\
  \ {9, choice, 0#shrug|1#shrugs}. "Keeps me alive," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}. The lance isn't\
  \ sure if he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} joking.
SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry spits exactly once outside the DropShip before\
  \ entering it, rubs the underside of his helmet before a skirmish, and always, always makes a quick,\
  \ unreadable mark on his harness before booting up. No one has ever seen him forget one of these\
  \ rituals. And the one time someone tried to mess with them? The mission went horribly wrong.
SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't know where he picked up his habits, only\
  \ that they have to be done. Before every mission, he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters} phrases in a\
  \ language that isn't his, pockets a bullet casing from the last fight, and refuses to eat or drink\
  \ in the last hour before deployment. "What happens if you stop?" someone asks. Barry just stares\
  \ at them for an uncomfortably long time before replying, "We don't want to find out."
SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just sign off on jobs - he {9, choice, 0#walk|1#walks}\
  \ around his workstation three times first, knocks on it in a very specific pattern, and occasionally\
  \ sniffs the air before nodding. "Standard procedure," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}. It's not.
SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry won't do anything unless he first taps the console\
  \ twice with the back of his knuckles and places a single unspent round on top of it. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#move|1#moves} the bullet only when the job is finished. "It's for luck," he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#explain|1#explains}. "Whose?" someone asks. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} answer.
SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry follows strict steps before finalizing reports - he\

  \ tally mark onto the corner of his desk, and {9, choice, 0#whisper|1#whispers} something no one\

SUPERVISED_HABITS.label=Highly Supervised Habits
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry never enters battle without running the exact same\
  \ pre-mission checks, always in full view of at least one superior officer. If no one's watching?\
  \ He won't start. "Regulations," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says} when questioned. No one can find those\
  \ regulations anywhere, but that doesn't stop him.
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's gear logs, movement reports, and even meal schedules\
  \ are always reviewed by someone higher up. He {9, choice, 0#pretend|1#pretends} not to notice, but\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does}. If he {9, choice, 0#deviate|1#deviates} even slightly from his\
  \ routine, a quiet note appears in his file. He {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} no idea why - but he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#make|1#makes} sure to follow protocol exactly anyway.
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry used to wonder why he had to log his every action.\
  \ Why he had to check in with command even for minor tasks. Why his reports were always cross-checked\
  \ against surveillance logs. But he stopped asking questions when he saw what happened to the\
  \ last guy who didn't follow procedure.
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's logs are double-checked, his reports personally\
  \ reviewed by command, and every one of his transactions requires approval. "It's just standard\
  \ oversight," they tell him. "Sure," he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}, stamping another form\
  \ while his every action is quietly noted.
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just log his hours - he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows}\
  \ his workstation is monitored, his comms are recorded, and his tasks are reported up the chain.\
  \ If someone asks why, he {9, choice, 0#shrug|1#shrugs}. "It's just how things work around here." It wasn't always like this.
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry can't step out of line, not even a little. The last time\
  \ he took one shortcut, he got called into a very quiet meeting. Nothing was said outright, but\

TECH_TALK.label=Incessant Tech Talk

TECH_TALK.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just talk tech - he hides in it. Talk about\

  \ breaking down armor slag statistics. The moment he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops} analyzing specs\

TECH_TALK.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry never simplifies. "It's a simple fix, right?" someone asks.\

TECH_TALK.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry isn't just good at his job - he {9, choice, 0#insist|1#insists}\

TECH_TALK.description.2.SUPPORT=People die. Battles are lost. War is chaos. But numbers? Numbers\
  \ don't lie. Systems work or they don't. Data doesn't betray you. Barry clings to his tech talk\

TECHNOPHOBIA.label=Phobia of Technology
TECHNOPHOBIA.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry keeps his targeting HUD off as often as possible, swears\
  \ by manual firing overrides, and refuses to rely on automated systems. "You trust that garbage?"\

TECHNOPHOBIA.description.1.COMBATANT="You think your helmet's safe? Ha. Ever read about feedback\

TECHNOPHOBIA.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just distrust technology - he despises it.\
  \ He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen MekWarriors suffocate from malfunctioning life support systems,\

TECHNOPHOBIA.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry hates technology. "You think this reactor is stable?\
  \ Please. The second one capacitor misaligns, boom - you're debris." He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} the\

TECHNOPHOBIA.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't fear technology because he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}\

  \ He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen what happens when an IFF controlled turret malfunctions, when a\

THESAURUS.label=Uses Obscure Words
THESAURUS.description.0.COMBATANT="We should establish a more oblique approach vector; otherwise,\
  \ we'll be in a tactically unenviable position." Barry's lance stares. "Barry. Just say go\
  \ left." He {9, choice, 0#sigh|1#sighs}. "Fine. Go left."
THESAURUS.description.1.COMBATANT="Deploy to the interstitial zone before the enemy enacts an\
  \ envelopment maneuver." "Barry, what?" "Move to the alley before they surround us!" His lance\
  \ has learned that when Barry starts using big words, they need to move fast - even if they don't\
  \ fully understand why.
THESAURUS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry refuses to let war reduce him to grunts and curses. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#speak|1#speaks} in layered, precise language because it reminds him that\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} still human. That he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} still thinking. Because the\

THESAURUS.description.0.SUPPORT="Barry, do we have any spare Class-3s?" "Ah, you seek thermoregulatory\

THESAURUS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just do his job - he {9, choice, 0#narrate|1#narrates}\
  \ it with unnecessarily complicated words. "The logistical stratification of these assets necessitates\
  \ a nuanced redistribution methodology." "Barry, just say we need to move some crates." "But that\

THESAURUS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't say "task failed." He {9, choice, 0#say|1#says} "the\

THIRD_PERSON.description.0.COMBATANT="Barry doesn't like this. Barry thinks this is a bad plan." His\

THIRD_PERSON.description.1.COMBATANT="Barry is moving to cover now. Barry is reloading. Barry would\

THIRD_PERSON.description.0.SUPPORT="Barry appreciates your patience. Barry is considering your\

THIRD_PERSON.description.2.SUPPORT="Barry will remember this." "Barry thinks this is a mistake, but\

TIME_MANAGEMENT.label=Obsessed with Time Management
TIME_MANAGEMENT.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just plan missions - he {9, choice, 0#schedule|1#schedules}\
  \ them down to the second. "If we're not moving in ten seconds, we're already behind." His lance\

  \ they stop arguing.
TIME_MANAGEMENT.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry counts everything. The seconds between artillery strikes,\
  \ the delay in enemy response times, the precise moment to duck before an incoming shot. His\
  \ lance used to think it was a weird habit - until they realized he never {9, choice, 0#mistime|1#mistimes}\
  \ a move.
TIME_MANAGEMENT.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just track time - he {9, choice, 0#dread|1#dreads}\

  \ deadline. He {9, choice, 0#schedule|1#schedules} things not because he {9, choice, 0#like|1#likes}\

TIME_MANAGEMENT.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's personal planner is a masterpiece of efficiency -\

TIME_MANAGEMENT.description.1.SUPPORT="I have precisely four minutes for this discussion." "I planned\

  \ deadlines is impressive, frustrating, and sometimes a little scary.
TIME_MANAGEMENT.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just track time - he {9, choice, 0#hoard|1#hoards}\
  \ it. Every lost minute is another missed opportunity, another delay that could mean something worse\
  \ later. He {9, choice, 0#move|1#moves} fast, {9, choice, 0#plan|1#plans} faster, because slowing\

TINKERER.label=Compulsive Tinkerer
TINKERER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's weapons, armor, and equipment are always in pieces, even\
  \ when there's nothing wrong with them. He {9, choice, 0#insist|1#insists} he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ "just improving performance," but his lance has caught him reassembling a perfectly functional\
  \ radio just because something 'felt off.'
TINKERER.description.1.COMBATANT=Standard-issue gear? Not a chance. Barry's sidearm has a custom\
  \ grip, his biometrics system runs on a personally adjusted algorithm, and no one quite understands\
  \ what he did to his HUD. His mods usually work - until they don't.
TINKERER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry keeps his hands busy with wires, screws, and tools because if\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}, his mind wanders. Machines are simple. Machines make sense. Unlike\
  \ the battlefield, unlike war, unlike the choices he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} made. If he can fix one\
  \ more thing, maybe he won't feel how much he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} already lost.
TINKERER.description.0.SUPPORT=Even if something is running perfectly, Barry is convinced it\
  \ can be better. He reconfigures systems, fine-tunes settings, and makes adjustments that most\
  \ people never notice - but he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does}. And it bothers him if he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} tweak it.
TINKERER.description.1.SUPPORT=If something has moving parts, Barry will take it apart. Pens,\
  \ terminals, doors - if it's in front of him long enough, he'll be "just checking something" and\
  \ then suddenly it's in pieces. Most of the time, he {9, choice, 0#put|1#puts} things back better.\
  \ Most of the time.
TINKERER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry fixes what's in front of him - tools, systems, useless little\
  \ things - because it's easier than fixing what's actually wrong. The broken supply chain. The\
  \ dwindling resources. The names disappearing from the roster. If he {9, choice, 0#focus|1#focuses}\

TRUTH_TELLER.label=Habitual Truth-Teller
TRUTH_TELLER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in false hope. "This is a bad plan," he\

TRUTH_TELLER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't lie, even when he probably should. "You're a\
  \ terrible shot," he {9, choice, 0#tell|1#tells} a rookie after a botched drill. "That flank will\
  \ collapse in three minutes if we don't move now," he warns the commander. No one ever likes what\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} to say - but ignoring him tends to get people killed.
TRUTH_TELLER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen what happens when people believe comfortable\
  \ lies. The 'easy mission' that turned into a massacre. The 'reinforcements coming' that never\
  \ arrived. He {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to be part of it. If the truth is ugly, then people\
  \ need to face it. Anything else is just setting up another grave to be filled.
TRUTH_TELLER.description.0.SUPPORT="This system is failing," Barry states flatly. "The numbers\
  \ don't add up. The schedule won't hold. That plan won't work." People hate bringing problems to\

  \ the blow.
TRUTH_TELLER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't deal in 'maybes' or 'it should be fines.' He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#want|1#wants} facts. If something is a disaster waiting to happen, he'll say so.\
  \ If someone asks for his opinion, they'd better be ready for it. "You want my honest answer? Or\
  \ the one that won't hurt your feelings?" he {9, choice, 0#ask|1#asks}. Either way, he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} which one they're giving.
TRUTH_TELLER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't soften words because too many people have died\
  \ believing the wrong ones. False optimism has cost lives. Misleading reports have led to\

UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.label=Unnecessary Caution
UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry double-checks every safety, scans for traps in\

  \ before stepping onto the DropShip. "Barry, it's a milk run," someone says. "That's what they said\

UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry clears every building like it's booby-trapped,\
  \ refuses to fire unless he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} sure it's a clean shot, and won't step forward\

UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry isn't just cautious - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ haunted. He {9, choice, 0#remember|1#remembers} the comrade who didn't check their six, the\

UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's paranoia isn't about efficiency - it's about survival.\
  \ He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen how fast things spiral when someone gets lazy. A rushed approval.\

UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.label=Unpredictable Speech
UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.description.0.COMBATANT=One moment, Barry is delivering a perfectly detailed\

UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.description.1.COMBATANT="Okay, so imagine the enemy is a pack of hungry dogs,\
  \ and we're holding a steak just out of reach - no, wait, bad example, let's say they're a bunch\

UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's words jump between cold, clinical detachment\

UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry starts a sentence with "Per my previous assessment,\

  \ just {9, choice, 0#laugh|1#laughs} and says "Define okay."

UNUSUAL_HOBBIES.label=Unusual Hobbies
UNUSUAL_HOBBIES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry spends downtime in ways that don't quite make sense.\

UNUSUAL_HOBBIES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry carves intricate symbols into his armor, spends hours\

UNUSUAL_HOBBIES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry isn't learning random hobbies because they're fun.\

WATCH.label=Constantly Checking the Time

WHISTLER.label=Frequent Whistler
WHISTLER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry whistles while mounting the DropShip, while advancing\

  \ when the whistling stops, they know things have gone very wrong.
WHISTLER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry has a tune for everything. A jaunty whistle during prep,\

  \ fitting for the moment.
WHISTLER.description.2.COMBATANT=The battlefield is loud, but the moments between the noise are\
  \ worse. Barry whistles to fill the void, to drown out the memories of screams and static-filled\
  \ last words. It's not about the tune - it's about making sure there's always something to listen\
  \ to.
WHISTLER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry whistles while walking, while working, while thinking.\

WORRIER.description.0.SUPPORT="That system is overdue for maintenance." "We're cutting it close on\
  \ time." "Has anyone accounted for contingencies?" Barry isn't negative - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ just realistic. And when something does go wrong, the first thing people say is, "Barry called it."
WORRIER.description.1.SUPPORT=Even when everything seems fine, Barry worries. "We're ahead of\
  \ schedule, but what if something delays us?" "We have the supplies, but what if demand\
  \ increases?" His coworkers try to calm him down, but he always {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} one more\

WORRIER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry isn't just anxious - he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} something's\

WRITER.label=Aspiring Writer
WRITER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry spends downtime between missions jotting down ideas in a battered\
  \ notebook. He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} convinced their story will be a bestseller - if he ever he {9, choice, 0#survive|1#survives}\
  \ long enough to finish it. "If I die, someone make sure they spell my name right in the dedication."
WRITER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry approaches his writing with the same methodical focus he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#bring|1#brings} to combat - steady, deliberate, and unwilling to accept failure.\
  \ He {9, choice, 0#rewrite|1#rewrites} constantly, never satisfied with the result. "Yeah, I've\
  \ started over a few times. Third draft's looking better, though."
WRITER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry writes because it's the only way to process the things\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen. The words are sharp, brutal, and honest in a way that scares even\
  \ him sometimes. "If I don't put it down on paper, it stays in my head. And trust me - you don't\
  \ want it staying there."
WRITER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's novel is perpetually unfinished, but that doesn't stop him from\
  \ talking about it like it's just a few chapters away from being complete. "Yeah, I'm almost done.\
  \ Just need to rewrite the beginning. And the middle. And maybe the end."
WRITER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's writing is rough, unpolished, but deeply personal. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} care if it's perfect - he just {9, choice, 0#want|1#wants} it to\
  \ feel real. "I'm not writing for anyone else. If you don't like it, don't read it."
WRITER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's writing isn't about ambition - it's about control. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ trying to make sense of the chaos around him, shaping it into something meaningful. The fact that\
  \ people might actually read it someday is secondary. "If the galaxy's gonna burn, at least let me\

BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.label=Constantly Reminiscing
BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.description.0.COMBATANT="This reminds me of a fight we had on Kelenfold. Same\
  \ terrain, same bad odds." Barry always has a story, always a comparison to something before. His\
  \ lance listens - sometimes for wisdom, sometimes just to hear about a time when things weren't so\
  \ bad.
BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just remember past battles - he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#live|1#lives} in them. He {9, choice, 0#compare|1#compares} every engagement to\
  \ something that happened before, as if history is on a loop and they're just playing out a rerun.\
  \ "We've been here before," he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}. "Not here-here, but close enough."
BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry talks about old wars, old missions, old friends.\
  \ Sometimes it's nostalgia. Sometimes it's guilt. Sometimes it's just because if he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#think|1#thinks} too hard about right now, about everything falling apart, he won't\
  \ be able to keep going.
BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.description.0.SUPPORT=No matter what's happening, Barry relates it to something\
  \ that came before. "This reminds me of the time we had to pull triple shifts because of a command\
  \ error." "We used to have a system for this - back when things actually worked." He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} complain - he just {9, choice, 0#remember|1#remembers}.
BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just talk about what's happening now - he\
  \ always {9, choice, 0#find|1#finds} a way to bring up what used to be. "Things were different\
  \ before the company got big." "You should've seen the old crew - real professionals." It's never\
  \ clear if he {9, choice, 0#miss|1#misses} the past or just {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to let\
  \ it go.
BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry clings to memories like they're the last stable thing\
  \ left. The names, the places, the stories - they're all still real as long as he {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps}\
  \ saying them out loud. Because if he ever {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops} talking about the past,\

HEAVY_HANDED.label=Heavy-Handed With Equipment
HEAVY_HANDED.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry slaps control panels, kicks unresponsive consoles, and\
  \ reloads his weapons with enough force to make the mechanisms groan. "That's not how you're\
  \ supposed to-" someone starts, only to watch as Barry forces a jammed system back into working\
  \ order through sheer brute insistence.
HEAVY_HANDED.description.1.COMBATANT="'Meks can take a beating. So can pistols. So can this." Barry\
  \ yanks a jammed sidearm free with enough force to nearly break the slide, wrenches a stuck panel\
  \ open with his bare hands, and shoves a power cell into place like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ punching it into submission. His lance has learned to hand him the spares.
HEAVY_HANDED.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't care if he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} hard on his gear.\
  \ It'll break. It always breaks. So he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} treat it gently - he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#use|1#uses} it until it fails, then finds something else to replace it.\
  \ He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen too many things - and people - fall apart to pretend anything is\
  \ built to last.
HEAVY_HANDED.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't handle things - he {9, choice, 0#manhandle|1#manhandles}\
  \ them. He {9, choice, 0#type|1#types} hard  enough to shake the terminal, closes panels with\
  \ enough force to make them rattle, and tightens bolts to the point where no one else can loosen\
  \ them again.
HEAVY_HANDED.description.1.SUPPORT=If something isn't working, Barry's first instinct is violence.\
  \ A firm smack, a hard shove, a sharp twist. "That's not how you fix it," someone mutters. Then\
  \ the system boots up, the machine hums to life, or the issue just disappears. No one knows how\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it, but it keeps happening.
HEAVY_HANDED.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't have time for delicate fixes or careful handling.\
  \ The system works, or it doesn't. If it breaks, he'll force it to work or move on to something\
  \ that will. He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen too much, lost too much, to waste time being gentle\
  \ with something that might not even last another day.

RATION_HOARDER.label=Hoarding Rations
RATION_HOARDER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry never trusts supply lines. He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got\
  \ ration bars stuffed in his boots, emergency packs taped onto his helmet, and a hidden stash of\
  \ canned food somewhere in the barracks. "You never know when things go bad," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}.\
  \ The way he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says} it makes people wonder if he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} speaking\
  \ from experience.
RATION_HOARDER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't waste a single calorie. Every meal is planned,\
  \ every extra bite stored for later. While others celebrate after a mission with a feast, Barry\
  \ quietly pockets leftovers. "Might need it later," he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}. His lance\
  \ jokes about it - until they're starving behind enemy lines and he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} the only\
  \ one still eating.
RATION_HOARDER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just hoard rations - he {9, choice, 0#protect|1#protects}\
  \ them. He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen people go without, seen how quickly desperation sets in when\
  \ food runs out. He never {9, choice, 0#let|1#lets} himself be that vulnerable again. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} care if people think it's paranoia. When the time comes, he'll be\

RATION_HOARDER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry always has extra. A drawer full of protein bars, a private\
  \ stash of nutrient packs, and a few "just in case" items tucked away where no one thinks to\
  \ check. He never {9, choice, 0#admit|1#admits} to it - until someone else runs out of food, and\
  \ he casually {9, choice, 0#hand|1#hands} them something to eat.
RATION_HOARDER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry eats strategically. He {9, choice, 0#stretch|1#stretches}\
  \ rations, {9, choice, 0#save|1#saves} portions for later, and never {9, choice, 0#assume|1#assumes}\
  \ there'll be another meal. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} not stingy - he just {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows}\
  \ better than to believe in a steady supply of anything.
RATION_HOARDER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry hoards food because he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen what\
  \ happens when people don't have enough. The fear, the desperation, the way alliances shatter over\
  \ a single meal. He'd rather be prepared than be one of the ones begging.

EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.label=Obsessive Manual Reader
EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just use weapons and equipment - he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#study|1#studies} them. He can quote weight distribution, fire rates, and optimal\
  \ calibration settings from memory. "Barry, just fire the damn thing!" someone shouts. "Not before\
  \ I confirm its heat efficiency tolerances," he {9, choice, 0#reply|1#replies}, flipping through a\
  \ dog-eared field guide.
EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.description.1.COMBATANT=If there's a standard operating procedure, Barry\
  \ follows it to the letter. If there isn't, he {9, choice, 0#find|1#finds} one. He once took a minute\
  \ mid-skirmish to check a repair guide before rerouting his weapon's coolant lines. His lance swears\
  \ he must be part-machine with how efficiently he processes instructions.
EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.description.2.COMBATANT=War is messy. Orders change. People die. But manuals?\
  \ Manuals are structured, predictable, reliable. Barry reads them obsessively because they offer\
  \ certainty - cold, clinical instructions that don't lie, don't panic, and don't get killed when\
  \ things go wrong.
EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry won't touch anything without consulting the exact\
  \ procedures. "Let's just figure it out," someone suggests. "Or," Barry says, holding up a heavily\
  \ annotated guide, "we could follow the documented process and not break something."
EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry keeps physical copies of manuals even when digital\
  \ versions are readily available. He {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} a personal archive of reference materials\
  \ for everything - even things he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} personally work with. "You never\
  \ know when you'll need to troubleshoot an emergency oxygen scrubber," he {9, choice, 0#insist|1#insists}.
EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry reads every procedure, every emergency guide, every\
  \ outdated manual because he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen what happens when people don't know what\

  \ - but for when they do.

QUICK_TO_QUIP.label=Quick to Make Jokes
QUICK_TO_QUIP.description.0.COMBATANT=Bullets are flying, alerts are blaring, and Barry is grinning.\
  \ "Well, this is suboptimal," he {9, choice, 0#laugh|1#laughs} as an enemy round barely misses him.\
  \ His lance groans, but they know - if Barry's still joking, the fight isn't completely lost yet.
QUICK_TO_QUIP.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry never lets a situation stay too serious. "If we die, I\
  \ just want you all to know - I left my laundry on." His lance doesn't always appreciate the\
  \ timing, but sometimes, the right joke at the right time is just enough to break the tension.
QUICK_TO_QUIP.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry jokes because if he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}, he\
  \ might have to actually think about what's happening. The losses, the suffering, the weight of\
  \ everything - it's too much. So instead, he {9, choice, 0#crack|1#cracks} another joke, forces\
  \ another grin, and keeps moving like nothing's wrong.
QUICK_TO_QUIP.description.0.SUPPORT=No matter what's happening, Barry finds a way to comment on it.\
  \ "Oh, another system failure? I'm shocked. Truly." His coworkers groan, but when things get\
  \ stressful, his humor is sometimes the only thing keeping them from snapping.
QUICK_TO_QUIP.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry knows when people are tense, and his first instinct is\
  \ always to break the tension with a joke. "Bad news: We're out of supplies. Good news: Now we\
  \ have a valid excuse to take a really long lunch break." It's impossible to stay completely\
  \ miserable around him.
QUICK_TO_QUIP.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry makes jokes because if he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops},\
  \ everything starts feeling too real. He can't fix the shortages, the losses, or the slow collapse\
  \ of everything they've built - but he can make people laugh, even if only for a moment. And\
  \ sometimes, that's the only thing keeping them all from breaking.

TECH_SKEPTIC.label=Distrusts New Technology
TECH_SKEPTIC.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry hates new tech. If it's not field-tested, battle-worn,\
  \ and proven reliable, he {9, choice, 0#want|1#wants} nothing to do with it. "They say this\
  \ targeting system improves  accuracy by 14%," someone says. Barry scoffs. "And I say it's gonna\
  \ get you killed when it glitches at the worst possible moment."
TECH_SKEPTIC.description.1.COMBATANT="Assisted targeting? No thanks. I trust my own aim." Barry\
  \ refuses to rely on advanced systems, opting for manual overrides, old-school tactics, and tech\
  \ he can actually repair himself. His lance mocks his stubbornness - until their fancy gear\
  \ inevitably malfunctions, and Barry's old methods keep him alive.
TECH_SKEPTIC.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry isn't just skeptical - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} haunted\
  \ by past failures. The cutting-edge weapons that jammed, the prototype that failed, the experimental\
  \ implants that fried their users from the inside out. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} hate\
  \ innovation - he just {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} that in war, new means untested, and untested\
  \ means deadly.
TECH_SKEPTIC.description.0.SUPPORT="Why upgrade something that isn't broken?" Barry refuses to\
  \ switch to the newest software, insists on using old tools, and distrusts anything marketed as\
  \ "next-gen." If forced to adopt new tech, he still {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} the old version\
  \ just in case.
TECH_SKEPTIC.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry won't touch new systems until they've been through hell\
  \ and back. "They say this interface makes things 'more efficient.' Yeah? Let's see how\
  \ 'efficient' it is when it inevitably crashes at the worst time." He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} always\
  \ got a backup plan because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} always expecting failure.
TECH_SKEPTIC.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry remembers the computer-controlled security that\
  \ malfunctioned and started targeting friendlies. The automated supply chain that collapsed when\
  \ one bad update corrupted the entire system. The experimental life support module that wasn't\
  \ tested enough. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} avoid new tech because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ stubborn - he {9, choice, 0#avoid|1#avoids} it because he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} better.

POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.label=Performs Post-Battle Rituals
POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.description.0.COMBATANT=Win or lose, Barry follows the exact same steps after every\
  \ engagement. He {9, choice, 0#clean|1#cleans} his weapon the same way, {9, choice, 0#check|1#checks}\
  \ his gear in the same order, and {9, choice, 0#take|1#takes} a deep breath at the same moment in\

  \ about something else entirely.
POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry kneels, mutters a phrase in a language no one recognizes,\
  \ and presses his fingers against the barrel of his weapon for exactly five seconds. "What are\
  \ you doing?" someone finally asks. He {9, choice, 0#shrug|1#shrugs}. "Making sure we got through\

POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't know when he started his post-battle rituals.\
  \ He just {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} to do them. The moment he\

POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.description.0.SUPPORT=After every engagement, Barry follows a precise series of\

POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry can't explain why he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it - why he marks down the names\

OVER_COMMUNICATOR.label=Over-Explains
OVER_COMMUNICATOR.description.0.COMBATANT="Barry, is your weapon jammed?" "Technically, it's not a\

OVER_COMMUNICATOR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just explain - he over-{9, choice, 0#explain|1#explains}\

  \ every single shot. "Nine left. Two more reloads. Twenty-three hostiles still moving." His lance\
  \ doesn't always appreciate the running tally, but when ammo runs low, Barry's the only one who\
  \ actually knows how much is left.
AMMO_COUNTER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry counts enemy movements, tracks their steps, and notes the\
  \ exact delay between artillery salvos. "That Long Tom fires every 6.4 seconds," he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}. "We have 3.2 seconds to move." Someone scoffs - until Barry\
  \ steps out exactly on time, avoiding the blast.
AMMO_COUNTER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't count for fun. He {9, choice, 0#count|1#counts}\
  \ because it's the only thing keeping him grounded. He {9, choice, 0#track|1#tracks} shots, seconds,\
  \ distances - anything but the number of bodies left behind. The moment he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}\
  \ counting, he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} he'll have to face those numbers too.
AMMO_COUNTER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry counts steps, counts supplies, counts the seconds between\
  \ each transmission ping. If something isn't accounted for, it bothers him. "How many crates were\
  \ moved?" "Forty-six." "You didn't even check." "I know." And he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} always right.
AMMO_COUNTER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry tracks everything from the number of times someone taps\
  \ their pen to how many times a door opens in a shift. No one knows why he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does}\
  \ it, and even he {9, choice, 0#aren't|1#isn't} sure anymore. "How many times has that console\
  \ flickered today?" "Seventeen." "...Barry, why?" "Why not?"
AMMO_COUNTER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry can't stop counting. The seconds between system checks,\
  \ the steps between buildings, the number of people who were here yesterday but aren't today. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} know what will happen when he {9, choice, 0#lose|1#loses} count,\
  \ but something deep inside tells him he never {9, choice, 0#want|1#wants} to find out.

BRAVADO.label=Excessive Bravado
BRAVADO.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry never enters a fight quietly. "Two lances of heavy\
  \ 'Mek? Easy. They should've sent more if they wanted a challenge." He grins like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ completely unfazed, even when he definitely should be concerned. The problem? Sometimes he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ actually good enough to pull it off.
BRAVADO.description.1.COMBATANT="This is fine," Barry says, standing in the open as artillery\
  \ shells rain down. "I've seen worse." He {9, choice, 0#haven't|1#hasn't}. He definitely hasn't. But he'll keep up the act\
  \ until either the battle ends or someone physically drags him to cover.
BRAVADO.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry talks big because if he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}, someone else will break\
  \ first. He boasts, he {9, choice, 0#laugh|1#laughs}, he grins like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} invincible - because if he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}, if he admits\
  \ how bad things really are, the weight of it all might finally crush him.
BRAVADO.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just fix problems - he {9, choice, 0#make|1#makes} it sound like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ pulling off miracles. "You need this report done? Lucky for you, I'm the best there is." "Oh, a\
  \ system malfunction? Give me five minutes and witness greatness."
BRAVADO.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry isn't just confident - he {9, choice, 0#act|1#acts} like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} single-handedly\
  \ holding the entire operation together. "Without me? This whole thing would fall apart." It's\
  \ unclear if he actually {9, choice, 0#believe|1#believes} it, but he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says} it so often, others start to wonder if he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ right.
BRAVADO.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has to act like everything is under control, like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} too\
  \ good to fail. Because if he lets even one crack show, if he even acknowledges how dire things\
  \ are, the whole illusion shatters. So he smirks, flexes, and keeps acting like the universe\
  \ hasn't already stacked the deck against him.

COMBAT_SONG.label=Sings During Engagements
COMBAT_SONG.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry belts out a tune the moment the shooting starts.\
  \ Sometimes it's a classic war ballad, sometimes it's an old drinking song, and sometimes it's\
  \ just wordless humming. It's both comforting and deeply unsettling - especially when his voice\
  \ stays perfectly steady even under heavy fire.
COMBAT_SONG.description.1.COMBATANT=Bullets fly, explosions shake the ground, and Barry? Barry's\
  \ singing. "Barry, why the hell are you singing right now?" someone shouts. "Gotta keep morale\
  \ up!" he yells back - right before nailing a perfect headshot while still holding a tune.
COMBAT_SONG.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry sings because it drowns everything else out. The screams,\
  \ the comm chatter, the sound of his own heartbeat pounding in his skull. If he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops} singing,\
  \ that means the battle's over - and that means he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} to face whatever's left behind.
COMBAT_SONG.description.0.SUPPORT=While alarms blare and chaos erupts, Barry is whistling a tune\
  \ and getting to work. The DropShip might be on fire, the systems might be failing, but that\
  \ won't stop him from casually humming an old folk song as he {9, choice, 0#work|1#works}.
COMBAT_SONG.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's voice is steady, unfazed, even when things go sideways.\
  \ He sings because it helps, because someone has to act like everything's still under control.\
  \ "If Barry's still singing," someone mutters, "then maybe we're not totally screwed yet."
COMBAT_SONG.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't even realize when he {9, choice, 0#start|1#starts} singing. His hands\
  \ move on autopilot, his voice carries through the chaos, and for a moment, it's like nothing's\
  \ wrong. If he {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} singing, he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} have to think about the names missing from the roster\
  \ after this is over.

COMMS_TOGGLE.label=Constantly Toggles Comms Channels
COMMS_TOGGLE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry cycles through comms channels like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} flipping through\
  \ music stations. Lance chatter, command directives, even open frequencies - if anyone is talking,\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} listening. "Barry, stay on our channel!" "I am - mostly."
COMMS_TOGGLE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry has to hear what's going on. Friendly lances, enemy\
  \ signals, background noise - he constantly switches between them. "Gotta stay informed," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}.\
  \ His lance jokes that he probably {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} the enemy's dinner plans before they do.
COMMS_TOGGLE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry keeps flipping channels because silence means something\
  \ has gone wrong. Someone's down. A signal's lost. A lance isn't reporting back. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen too\
  \ many comms go quiet forever - so he never {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops} listening, because the moment he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does}, he might\
  \ miss someone's last words.
COMMS_TOGGLE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry listens to every comms feed. Logistics, operations,\
  \ emergency reports - he jumps between them so fast it's a wonder he actually understands what's\
  \ going on. Somehow, though, he always {9, choice, 0#seem|1#seems} to catch the most important detail just in time.
COMMS_TOGGLE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't eavesdrop - he just happens to hear everything. One\
  \ second he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} tuned into maintenance chatter, the next he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} listening to high-level command\
  \ discussions. "You're not supposed to be on that channel, Barry." "Then why is it so easy to\
  \ access?"
COMMS_TOGGLE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry listens like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} expecting something. Some warning. Some\
  \ disaster. Some signal that no one else is paying attention to. And when someone asks why he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ so obsessed with monitoring channels, he just mutters, "Because I don't want to hear nothing."

EJECTION_READY.label=Paranoid About Emergency Systems
EJECTION_READY.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in safety assurances. If something is\
  \ meant to activate in a crisis, he {9, choice, 0#assume|1#assumes} it won't. He constantly checks, double-checks, and\
  \ personally verifies every precaution, because if something can fail, it will.
EJECTION_READY.description.1.COMBATANT="You trust that system? That's cute." Barry always has a backup\
  \ plan, an alternative escape route, or a manual override ready to go. He {9, choice, 0#assume|1#assumes} any warning\
  \ system is too slow, any failsafe is flawed, and that if he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} prepare himself, no one else\
  \ will.
EJECTION_READY.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen protections fail, safeguards ignored, and too\
  \ many people put their faith in something that was never properly tested. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} trust\
  \ emergency measures - not because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} paranoid, but because in his experience, they only work\
  \ when you don't actually need them.
EJECTION_READY.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just check emergency protocols - he {9, choice, 0#live|1#lives} by them.\
  \ If something is supposed to work in a crisis, he personally verifies it. If people aren't\
  \ following procedure, he {9, choice, 0#make|1#makes} sure they do. Others think he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} overreacting - until something\
  \ actually goes wrong.
EJECTION_READY.description.1.SUPPORT="You really believe that alarm will go off when it's supposed\
  \ to? That's... optimistic." Barry treats every emergency system as already broken until proven\
  \ otherwise. If something hasn't failed yet, it's because it hasn't had the chance to.
EJECTION_READY.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen what happens when maintenance gets lazy, when\
  \ procedures are skipped, when the wrong people sign off on safety reports. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} assume\
  \ an emergency system will work - he {9, choice, 0#assume|1#assumes} it won't. And when it doesn't, he won't be the one\
  \ caught off guard.

HAND_SIGNS.label=Uses Elaborate Hand Signals
HAND_SIGNS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just use standard gestures - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} got a whole extra\
  \ layer of silent communication. He signals things that don't need signals, and half the time,\
  \ his lance isn't even sure what he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} trying to say. The weird part? He seems to think everyone\
  \ should already know.
HAND_SIGNS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry gives entire tactical briefings with just his hands, even\
  \ when talking would be faster. He {9, choice, 0#insist|1#insists} it's more efficient - except when it isn't. His gestures\
  \ get more exaggerated the more frustrated he {9, choice, 0#are|1#is}, until it looks like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} orchestrating a silent\
  \ electro-opera.
HAND_SIGNS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just use hand signals as a preference - he relies\
  \ on them. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen how noise gives away positions, how a whispered word at the wrong time can\
  \ be the last thing someone says. He signals because it's safer. Because sometimes, speaking at\
  \ all is too dangerous.
HAND_SIGNS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just talk - he {9, choice, 0#narrate|1#narrates} with his hands. Simple\
  \ explanations become full-body performances, and anyone talking to him has to watch as much as\
  \ listen. "Are the signals necessary?" someone asks. "They enhance communication," Barry insists,\
  \ while pointing dramatically.
HAND_SIGNS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry insists his elaborate gestures are perfectly clear. They\
  \ are not. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} constantly flashing signals that only he {9, choice, 0#understand|1#understands}, expecting others to follow\
  \ along. "What does this mean?" someone asks, mimicking his motions. "That's obvious," Barry\
  \ scoffs. "It means 'consider alternatives.'"
HAND_SIGNS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen conversations get overheard, plans fall apart\
  \ because someone was listening when they shouldn't have been. He signals because it's safer.\
  \ Because habits save lives. And because sometimes, talking out loud means giving away too much\
  \ to the wrong person.

HATE_FOR_MEKS.label=Harbors a Deep Hatred for 'Mek
HATE_FOR_MEKS.description.0.COMBATANT="You really think a giant walking target is the best way to\
  \ fight a war?" Barry scoffs. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} trust Mek, doesn't like Mek, and won't stop reminding\
  \ everyone that half of history's worst battles were fought with people betting their lives on\
  \ unreliable metal coffins.
HATE_FOR_MEKS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just dislike Mek - he resents them. The\
  \ destruction, the collateral damage, the way they turn wars into who has the bigger machine\
  \ instead of who actually has skill. "People used to fight with their own hands," he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}.\
  \ "Now they just let a fusion engine do the killing for them."
HATE_FOR_MEKS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's hatred for Mek isn't abstract. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} been on the wrong\
  \ side of a 'Mek's guns, seen cities crushed under metal feet, watched people disappear in a\
  \ flash of energy fire. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} fear Mek - he despises them.
HATE_FOR_MEKS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry has an opinion, and he'll never stop sharing it. "Mek\
  \ are inefficient, wasteful, and a logistical nightmare." Whether it's repairs, resource\
  \ consumption, or just the fact that they exist at all, Barry never misses an opportunity to rant\
  \ about why they shouldn't.
HATE_FOR_MEKS.description.1.SUPPORT=If something goes wrong, Barry finds a way to blame it on Mek.\
  \ Supplies running low? "Because of 'Mek maintenance costs." Damage to infrastructure? "Because\
  \ some MekWarrior thought they were being tactical." He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} care how advanced they get - he\
  \ thinks they're all just walking catastrophes waiting to happen.
HATE_FOR_MEKS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just dislike Mek - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen what they leave\
  \ behind. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen men and women turned to slurry by 'Mek-scale machine guns, counted the losses\
  \ from ammo explosions, and watched the way entire cities break under the weight of 'Mek warfare.\
  \ He {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} Mek win wars. He also knows the damage they cause.

IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.label=Uses Improvised Weaponry
IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just rely on standard-issue arms - he {9, choice, 0#see|1#sees} weapons\
  \ everywhere. A loose piece of metal? A makeshift club. A handful of debris? A distraction tool.\
  \ "A gun's nice," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, "but creativity keeps you alive."
IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't wait for the perfect tool - he adapts. A broken\
  \ piece of equipment? A blunt weapon. A stray cable? A garrote. His lance has seen him turn\
  \ debris into effective tools of survival more times than they can count. "You fight with what\
  \ you have," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, "not what you wish you had."
IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust ammunition supplies, doesn't expect\
  \ reinforcements, doesn't assume he'll have what he {9, choice, 0#need|1#needs} when he {9, choice, 0#need|1#needs} it. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen fights last\
  \ longer than the weapons meant to win them. So he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} learned to make anything deadly - because he\
  \ refuses to be the one left empty-handed.
IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry has a habit of repurposing things. That wrench? A club.\
  \ That office chair? A barricade. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} go looking for fights, but if one happens, he'll\
  \ immediately size up his surroundings for what can be used in a pinch.
IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't assume safety. If things go bad, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} already\
  \ figured out how to use the tools around him as weapons. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} got a solid grip on that\
  \ clipboard for a reason. And if he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} holding a heavy-duty stapler? That's not an accident.
IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't trust in things being available when needed. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ seen people die reaching for weapons that weren't there. So he {9, choice, 0#treat|1#treats} everything like it might\

PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.label=Believes in Omens
PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just prepare for battle - he {9, choice, 0#read|1#reads} the battlefield\
  \ before it even starts. A bird flying against the wind? Bad sign. A weapon jam during pre-check?\
  \ Worse. If something feels off, he {9, choice, 0#adjust|1#adjusts} his approach immediately. Others call it paranoia,\
  \ but Barry swears it's saved his life before.
PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry has walked away from engagements because the omens were\
  \ wrong. If the sun rises through heavy fog, if the wind shifts in a way that feels unnatural, if\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#dream|1#dreams} of something he'd rather forget - he'll find a way to stall, adjust, or avoid the fight\
  \ entirely. People call him superstitious. He {9, choice, 0#call|1#calls} them reckless.
PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in luck, but he {9, choice, 0#believe|1#believes} in warnings.\
  \ He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} watched people ignore the signs - only for them to never return. A slight misstep, a broken\
  \ routine, a bird call at the wrong time - all dismissed, all followed by disaster. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} done\
  \ trying to convince others. He just hopes he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} smart enough to listen when it matters.
PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry hesitates before making decisions if something feels\
  \ wrong. Maybe it's a strange silence, maybe it's a bad dream, maybe it's just a gut feeling. But\
  \ if an omen tells him not to do something, he won't, and he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} care how irrational it seems.
PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't need dramatic omens - he {9, choice, 0#pick|1#picks} up on subtle ones. A\
  \ light flickering? A bad sign. A sudden chill in the air? Something's coming. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} always\
  \ say what he expects to happen, but the way he reacts makes it clear - he {9, choice, 0#believe|1#believes} something will.
PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry knows the universe is cruel, that fate doesn't care. But\
  \ omens? Omens give order to the chaos. They tell him when to act, when to wait, when to prepare\

  \ nothing is watching out for them at all.

SILENT_LEADER.label=Silent Leader
SILENT_LEADER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't give speeches. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} bark orders. He {9, choice, 0#move|1#moves},\

  \ a word - his lance finds themselves falling in line behind him.
SILENT_LEADER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't need to shout to be heard. A glance, a nod, a\
  \ subtle motion of his hand - it's all the direction his team needs. He rarely explains himself,\
  \ but when he {9, choice, 0#move|1#moves} with purpose, people trust him enough to follow without question.
SILENT_LEADER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen too many commanders make grand speeches, give\
  \ bold promises - only to watch them die meaningless deaths. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} inspire with words. He\
  \ inspires by surviving, by acting, by doing what has to be done without the need for\
  \ reassurance. Those who follow him don't do it because he {9, choice, 0#tell|1#tells} them to. They do it because he\

SILENT_LEADER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't waste time on debates or power struggles. When\

SILENT_LEADER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry never asks for recognition, never tries to take control.\
  \ But somehow, his way of doing things always becomes the way things get done. People look to him\

SILENT_LEADER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't lead because he {9, choice, 0#want|1#wants} to. He leads because someone\

BATTLE_CRITIC.label=Constant Critic
BATTLE_CRITIC.description.0.COMBATANT=No strategy is ever good enough for Barry. He {9, choice, 0#pick|1#picks} apart every\

  \ This timing is off by at least three seconds." It's exhausting - but more than once, his\

BATTLE_CRITIC.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't care about sparing feelings - he cares about\

  \ complains - until they realize he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} making them better.
BATTLE_CRITIC.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust victories. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen how overconfidence\

BATTLE_CRITIC.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't criticize to be difficult - he criticizes because he\

CHECKS_WEAPON_SAFETY.label=Constantly Performs Safety Checks

  \ don't skip steps."
CHECKS_WEAPON_SAFETY.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry expects things to go wrong, so he {9, choice, 0#prepare|1#prepares} before they\

CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry sees long-range engagements as impersonal, inefficient,\
  \ and, worst of all, boring. He thrives where things are fast, brutal, and decided in seconds.\
  \ "If I'm fighting," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, cracking his knuckles, "I want them to know it was me."
CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't take chances. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen enemies get back up when\
  \ people thought they were dead. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} watched someone turn away too soon, only to be caught off\
  \ guard. He {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} up close because when he ends something, he {9, choice, 0#make|1#makes} sure it stays ended.
CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't do passive solutions. If something needs fixing,\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} right there, hands-on, making sure it's handled properly. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} trust distant\
  \ coordination - he {9, choice, 0#get|1#gets} in the thick of it.
CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has no patience for discussions from across a room. He\
  \ closes distance, gets right in front of whoever he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} talking to, and makes sure they feel the\
  \ weight of his words. It's not aggression - it's just how he {9, choice, 0#operate|1#operates}. But people definitely take\
  \ it that way.
CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry hates distance - not just in fights, but in anything. If\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} involved, he {9, choice, 0#want|1#wants} to be right there, in the moment, in control. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen what happens\
  \ when you rely on detached solutions. Distance means risk. Distance means failure. And he won't\
  \ allow it.

COMBAT_POET.label=Recites Poetry
COMBAT_POET.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he {9, choice, 0#narrate|1#narrates} the moment. Whether it's\
  \ ancient war poetry, battlefield elegies, or lines of verse that no one else recognizes, he\
  \ speaks as if he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen this all before. "Bent double, we cursed through sludge; till towards\
  \ our distant rest began to trudge."
COMBAT_POET.description.1.COMBATANT=When the fight begins, Barry's voice is calm, rhythmic,\
  \ measured. A stanza here, a line there, whispered into comms like a battle hymn. His lance\
  \ doesn't know whether to be inspired or unsettled. His enemies? They just think he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} insane.
COMBAT_POET.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't recite poetry for theatrics. He {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it because\
  \ it's how he copes. The right words make chaos feel structured, give meaning to the things he'd\
  \ rather not think about. If he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops} speaking, if he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops} finding words for the war, then he'll\
  \ have to admit that none of it ever had meaning to begin with.
COMBAT_POET.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just talk - he quotes. Team meetings? A few\
  \ lines about the passing of time. Emergency briefings? Something about the toil of labor.\
  \ Whether anyone appreciates it or not, he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} a verse for everything.
COMBAT_POET.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry won't just answer questions - he'll answer them in poetry.\
  \ Sometimes it's his own, sometimes it's old, forgotten texts, and sometimes it's just whatever\
  \ fits the mood. "Barry, can you just say yes?" "I could - but where's the beauty in that?"
COMBAT_POET.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry speaks in poetry because it keeps the emptiness at bay.\
  \ He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen too many things that don't deserve to be remembered - but somehow, words make them\
  \ bearable. If he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops} finding poetry in the world, then all that's left is the cold, empty\
  \ void of everything that's been lost.

CUSTOM_DECALS.label=Obsessed with Custom Decals
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't leave anything plain. Armor, weapons,\
  \ vehicles - everything gets a custom touch. Whether it's hand-painted insignias, personal mottos,\
  \ or intricate symbols only he {9, choice, 0#understand|1#understands}, his gear is always distinctively his.
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's decals aren't random; they mean something. Every\
  \ marking tells a story - some a warning, some a remembrance. When people ask what they mean, he\
  \ gives different answers every time. Maybe they're just for him. Maybe they're for the people\
  \ who won't live to see the next one.
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry knows the war doesn't guarantee survival. But his\
  \ decals? They might last longer than he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does}. Maybe someone will see them one day, wonder who\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#were|1#was}, what he fought for. Maybe that's enough. Maybe that's all anyone can really hope for.
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry refuses to let anything be generic. His tools, his\
  \ workstation, even his reports have some kind of personalized insignia. If someone borrows\
  \ something of his, they'll know - because his signature touch is everywhere.
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry treats the unit insignia like a necessary part of life.\
  \ A blank wall? Unacceptable. An untouched case? Needs a mark. Whether it's subtle or elaborate,\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#find|1#finds} a way to leave the company's insignia on everything he {9, choice, 0#work|1#works} with.
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry personalizes things because he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} how quickly people\
  \ disappear. How fast their names are forgotten. If he can't control anything else, he can at\
  \ least leave behind something unique. If the war erases everything else, at least someone might\
  \ one day see his mark and remember he existed.

DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.label=Displays Trophies from Past Accomplishments
DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he {9, choice, 0#collect|1#collects} proof of his victories.\
  \ Spent shell casings, pieces of damaged armor, insignias from defeated foes - his personal space\
  \ is covered in relics from past engagements. "You keep all this junk for a reason?" someone\
  \ asks. Barry smirks. "It's not junk. It's history."
DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's trophies aren't just for himself. He {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} them\
  \ visible, a reminder of what he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} done and what he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} capable of. Some see them as badges of\
  \ honor. Others see them as a warning - a quiet message that Barry isn't someone to be\
  \ underestimated.
DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry keeps trophies not out of pride, but because if he\
  \ doesn't, what was it all for? Every token, every relic is a reminder that he survived, that his\
  \ actions meant something. Without them, everything he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} done might as well be forgotten. And\
  \ that's something he {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to let happen.
DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's workspace is full of personal trophies. Awards,\
  \ certificates, old mission patches - anything that proves he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} been here, that he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} done something\
  \ worth remembering. If someone asks about them, he'll always have a story ready.
DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just display his accomplishments - he relives them.\
  \ Every object on his shelf, every framed relic has a meaning, a memory. Whether people see them\
  \ as inspiring or self-indulgent, one thing is certain: Barry remembers everything he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} done.
DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't collect trophies for vanity. He {9, choice, 0#collect|1#collects} them\
  \ because he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} how quickly people disappear. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen names erased, legacies forgotten. If\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} these reminders, maybe someone will remember he {9, choice, 0#were|1#was} here. Maybe that will be enough.

DO_IT_YOURSELF.label=Obsessive Do-It-Yourselfer
DO_IT_YOURSELF.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust factory settings or off-the-shelf\
  \ solutions. If he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} using something, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} modified it himself. "Standard issue? Yeah, no\
  \ thanks." His gear is a patchwork of custom fixes, reinforced parts, and things no one else\
  \ fully understands.
DO_IT_YOURSELF.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry won't wait for specialists. He {9, choice, 0#adjust|1#adjusts} his gear, he\
  \ repairs his equipment, and he {9, choice, 0#make|1#makes} sure everything works his way. "You sure that's safe?"\
  \ someone asks as he rewires a system. "No," Barry says, "but now it actually works."
DO_IT_YOURSELF.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen things fail - equipment breaking when it\
  \ shouldn't, systems failing at the worst possible moment. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} trust standard designs,\
  \ because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen what happens when they let people down. If he can build it, fix it, or\
  \ improve it himself, at least he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} who to blame if it fails.
DO_IT_YOURSELF.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in pre-fabricated anything. If there's a\
  \ problem, he builds his own fix. His workspace is filled with half-finished projects, custom\
  \ tools, and modifications that no one else quite understands. "Why use stock solutions when you\
  \ can make something better?"
DO_IT_YOURSELF.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry won't use a tool without tweaking it first. Every system\
  \ he interacts with has some kind of Barry-approved modification. It's not official, but it works\
  \ better now. "You didn't like how it worked, so you just changed it?" someone asks. Barry nods.\
  \ "And now it's right."
DO_IT_YOURSELF.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry customizes everything because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen too many things\
  \ fail when they shouldn't. People trust that things will work the way they're designed. Barry\
  \ knows better. If he built it, if he reinforced it, then at least he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} it won't fail the\
  \ moment it's needed most

FIELD_IMPROVISER.label=Improvises with Field Supplies
FIELD_IMPROVISER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't worry about not having the right tools - he {9, choice, 0#make|1#makes}\
  \ do. A broken weapon, a missing component, an unexpected failure? He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} already rigging up a\
  \ solution with whatever he can scavenge. "You'd be amazed what you can build with a little\
  \ ingenuity and a complete lack of better options."
FIELD_IMPROVISER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just prepare - he adapts. If something isn't\

  \ "You can carry everything you need," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, grinning, "or you can just get creative when it\

FIELD_IMPROVISER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't expect things to be available when needed. Ammo\
  \ runs dry. Equipment fails. Reinforcements don't come. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} learned to use what's around him\
  \ because it's always better than waiting for something that isn't coming.
FIELD_IMPROVISER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry won't stop a task just because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} missing one thing. If\
  \ something's broken, he fixes it with whatever's on hand. If a system isn't cooperating, he rigs\
  \ up a workaround. "Not the cleanest fix," he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}, "but it works, and that's what matters."
FIELD_IMPROVISER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't wait for official repair parts or standardized\
  \ procedures - he figures something out. Need a replacement component? He'll find one. Can't access\
  \ a system? He'll bypass it. The methods might not be by the book, but somehow, they always work.
FIELD_IMPROVISER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen people fail because they waited for the proper\
  \ tools or the right conditions. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen how fast things go wrong. So he never assumes he'll\

LOUD_COMMS.label=Uses Loud Comms
LOUD_COMMS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's voice booms over comms, whether it's necessary or not.\
  \ "I SAID LEFT FLANK - ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING?" He {9, choice, 0#insist|1#insists} it's for clarity, but his lance is\
  \ pretty sure their eardrums are suffering more than the enemy.
LOUD_COMMS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just issue orders - he broadcasts them like a\
  \ declaration of war. If the enemy wasn't listening before, they definitely are now. His lance\
  \ isn't sure if it's intimidation or recklessness, but one thing's for sure: he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} impossible to\
  \ ignore.
LOUD_COMMS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry hates silence. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen comms go dead before - heard the\
  \ static where voices used to be. So he shouts, he yells, he forces noise into the\
  \ channel - because if he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} still hearing responses, then at least someone is still alive.
LOUD_COMMS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't do quiet radio chatter. His voice comes through\
  \ clear, sharp, and way too loud. "CONFIRMING STATUS - DO YOU COPY?" Even when no one needs him to\
  \ be that loud, he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it anyway.
LOUD_COMMS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's comms volume is permanently set to maximum. Whether he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ giving an update, issuing a routine report, or just checking in, it's like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} trying to reach\
  \ someone five jumps away. "Barry, we can hear you just fine." "GOOD."
LOUD_COMMS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's been on channels that have gone quiet. Too quiet. The\
  \ kind of quiet that means something's gone very wrong. So he {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} his voice loud, his comms\
  \ open, his presence unignorable. Because if the signal ever drops, if the voices ever cut out,\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} exactly what that means.

WAR_STORIES.label=Overly Fond of War Stories
WAR_STORIES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry has a story for every situation. "This reminds me of that\

WAR_STORIES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's stories are legendary, but also suspect. One day, it's\

  \ outdriving an artillery barrage on foot. His lance humors him, but no one's ever seen any\
  \ records to back them up.
WAR_STORIES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry tells stories not because they're entertaining, but\
  \ because he {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to let people be forgotten. He {9, choice, 0#speak|1#speaks} of old battles, fallen comrades,\
  \ places that don't exist anymore. He {9, choice, 0#remember|1#remembers} so that others won't have to. Or maybe, because\

WAR_STORIES.description.0.SUPPORT=No matter what's happening, Barry can connect it to something\
  \ he saw, heard about, or was totally involved in. "Supply problems? Ha! Back on Trellwan, we ran\
  \ an entire op on half-rations. Let me tell you - " Everyone knows once he {9, choice, 0#start|1#starts}, it's impossible\

WAR_STORIES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry keeps telling the same war stories because he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} one\

ALL_OR_NOTHING.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in measured risks. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} pull back,\

  \ all in." He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} either the first in the fight or the last one standing. There is no middle ground.
ALL_OR_NOTHING.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry commits fully to every action because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen what\

ALL_OR_NOTHING.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't do halfway. If he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} assigned a task, it's getting\

ALL_OR_NOTHING.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just commit - he overcommits. If he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} fixing\

BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.label=Prefers Grounded Tactics
BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust high-level strategies or overcomplicated\
  \ maneuvers. He {9, choice, 0#believe|1#believes} victory comes from direct control, from positioning, from knowing\

BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't put faith in big-picture strategies. He {9, choice, 0#focus|1#focuses}\

BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't waste time on high-level theories. He cares about\
  \ what actually works, what affects people on the ground. If a plan doesn't hold up in real\
  \ conditions, he won't even consider it. "Looks great on paper. Means nothing if it doesn't work\
  \ down here."
BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in complicated tactics. If something can't\

COCKPIT_DRIFTER.label=Daydreams

CONSPIRACY_THEORIST.label=Believes in Conspiracy Theories
CONSPIRACY_THEORIST.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust anything at face value. Every mission has\

CONSPIRACY_THEORIST.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just believe in conspiracies - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} trying to wake\

DEVOUT_WARRIOR.label=Warrior's Code Devotee
DEVOUT_WARRIOR.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't fight just to win; he {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} the right way. He\

DEVOUT_WARRIOR.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just live by his warrior's code - he expects others\

DEVOUT_WARRIOR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen what war does to people - how it strips them of\

DEVOUT_WARRIOR.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry approaches his work with the discipline of a warrior. He\

DEVOUT_WARRIOR.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry holds himself - and others - to a standard. He {9, choice, 0#believe|1#believes} in\

DUAL_WIELDING.label=Obsessed with Multitasking
DUAL_WIELDING.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in singular focus. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} coordinating\

DUAL_WIELDING.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry refuses to let his mind sit still. If he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} not actively\

DUAL_WIELDING.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just multitask - he {9, choice, 0#need|1#needs} to. If he {9, choice, 0#focus|1#focuses} on just\

DUAL_WIELDING.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry can't just do one thing. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} managing logistics while\

DUAL_WIELDING.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry treats downtime like a failure. If he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} not working on\

EMBLEM_LOVER.label=Attached to a Personal Emblem
EMBLEM_LOVER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's personal emblem isn't just a symbol - it's who he {9, choice, 0#are|1#is}.\
  \ It's on his armor, his gear, everything he owns. It represents loyalty, legacy, and purpose. If\
  \ anyone disrespects it, they disrespect him. And Barry doesn't take that lightly.
EMBLEM_LOVER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry makes sure his personal emblem is visible in every\
  \ engagement. He {9, choice, 0#believe|1#believes} in its meaning, its history, and what it stands for. "If I go down," he\
  \ mutters, adjusting it before a battle, "I go down under this symbol."
EMBLEM_LOVER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has lost people, places, and parts of himself to war, but\
  \ his personal emblem remains. It's the one thing he can still control. If that symbol is still\
  \ standing, then so is he.
EMBLEM_LOVER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry marks everything with his personal emblem - his uniform, his\
  \ tools, even his personal workspace. Whether it's nostalgia, pride, or something deeper, one\
  \ thing is clear: he won't be seen without it.
EMBLEM_LOVER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just wear his personal emblem - he {9, choice, 0#preserve|1#preserves} it. He\
  \ keeps it pristine, properly positioned, and never altered. If it's faded or damaged, he fixes\
  \ it immediately. "This isn't just decoration," he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}. "It matters."
EMBLEM_LOVER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry keeps his personal emblem close because he {9, choice, 0#need|1#needs} to. It's\

  \ If he ever {9, choice, 0#lose|1#loses} it, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} afraid he might lose himself, too.

EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.label=Obsessive Debriefer
EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he {9, choice, 0#analyze|1#analyzes}. The moment a battle ends,\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} already dissecting what worked and what didn't. Positioning, timing, individual\
  \ performance - nothing escapes review. "We got through it," someone says. "Yeah," Barry mutters,\
  \ taking notes, "but how much better could it have gone?"
EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry refuses to let mistakes go unnoticed. If something went\

  \ "This isn't criticism," he {9, choice, 0#insist|1#insists}. "It's survival. We learn, or we don't make it next time."
EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just analyze because he {9, choice, 0#want|1#wants} to - he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it\
  \ because he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} to. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen one overlooked detail turn into disaster. He reviews everything\
  \ because he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} somewhere in the data is the difference between living and dying next time.
EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry refuses to let a task go unexamined. After every\
  \ operation, he compiles full reports, goes over every detail, and demands everyone provide\
  \ feedback. "We don't just move on - we improve."
EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry won't let anything be dismissed as 'good enough'. Every\
  \ procedure, every decision, every single mistake gets analyzed in-depth. Some people find it\
  \ exhausting, but they also know that when Barry reviews something, nothing gets missed.
EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry can't stop reviewing because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen what happens when\

EYE_FOR_ART.label=Appreciates Battlefield Scenery
EYE_FOR_ART.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just see battlefields as places of destruction - he\
  \ sees art in the chaos. A burning skyline, the eerie silence before an engagement, the way smoke\
  \ curls against the horizon - he notices it all. "War is ugly," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, watching the sunrise over\
  \ wreckage, "but sometimes, it's damn beautiful too."
EYE_FOR_ART.description.1.COMBATANT=While others focus purely on tactics, Barry catches himself\
  \ staring at the way light reflects off armor, how dust settles after an explosion, how the world\
  \ keeps moving even in battle. It's not distraction - it's perspective. "You ever really look at a\
  \ battlefield?" he {9, choice, 0#ask|1#asks}. "Not just fight in it, but see it?"
EYE_FOR_ART.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry takes in every detail, every skyline, every storm rolling\
  \ over the wasteland - not because he {9, choice, 0#enjoy|1#enjoys} it, but because he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} it might be the last view he\
  \ ever has. In war, moments of beauty are fleeting, and he {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to let them go unnoticed.
EYE_FOR_ART.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't let war completely consume his senses. Even in the\
  \ middle of crisis management, he'll stop to notice the way dust swirls in the floodlights, the\
  \ eerie beauty of a battle-scarred skyline, the quiet hum of a base before deployment.
EYE_FOR_ART.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just see battlefields as tactical locations - he\
  \ appreciates them like landscapes. The shifting sands of a desert warzone, the glowing embers of\
  \ a city fight, the way ice cracks underfoot on frozen battlefields. "Everywhere has a mood," he\
  \ mutters. "You just have to notice it."
EYE_FOR_ART.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry watches the way rain falls on ruined buildings, the way\
  \ wind howls through shattered forests, the way the sky remains untouched no matter how much\
  \ destruction unfolds beneath it. He {9, choice, 0#cling|1#clings} to these small glimpses of beauty because if there's\
  \ still beauty, maybe there's still something worth fighting for.

FAST_TALKER.label=Talks Very Fast
FAST_TALKER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's mouth moves as fast as his mind - battle reports, status\
  \ updates, strategy shifts - all at rapid-fire speed. "Enemy left - no, two left - no, they're\
  \ repositioning - okay, we move now now now!" His lance is used to having to translate his comm\
  \ chatter into something understandable.
FAST_TALKER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry does not pause. He dumps all relevant information in one\
  \ long, breathless stream - sometimes before anyone even asks for it. "Barry, slow down." "No time\
  \ slowing wastes seconds seconds cost lives MOVE NOW."
FAST_TALKER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry keeps his words fast, his thoughts faster, because if he\
  \ slows down, the memories catch up. The losses, the failures, the ghosts of voices he'll never\
  \ hear again. So he {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} talking - because silence is worse.
FAST_TALKER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't pause - he {9, choice, 0#run|1#runs} through sentences like they're a\
  \ race. Reports, updates, even casual conversations come out in one long unbroken stream. "Okay\
  \ so here's the situation - supplies are low not critical but getting there plus we need to\
  \ reallocate resources or we're gonna have a big problem in maybe 36 hours max."
FAST_TALKER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry delivers every report, every status update, at maximum\
  \ speed, but somehow, he never actually misses a detail. It's like his brain moves faster than\
  \ everyone else's - or maybe he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} just used to thinking three steps ahead.
FAST_TALKER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't stop moving, doesn't stop talking, because\
  \ stopping means having to think about how bad things really are. If he just keeps moving, keeps\
  \ explaining, analyzing, summarizing, maybe he won't have to acknowledge just how close\
  \ everything is to falling apart.

FINGER_GUNS.label=Uses Finger Guns
FINGER_GUNS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry can drop an enemy, turn to his buddy, and still fire off a\
  \ pair of finger guns like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} just landed a perfect shot in a bar trick. "Got 'em." His lance\
  \ can't decide if it's confidence or insanity, but it's definitely amusing.
FINGER_GUNS.description.1.COMBATANT=Mid-battle, mid-debrief, mid-anything, Barry will fire off a\
  \ quick finger gun with a cocky grin. "We got this." Somehow, it works - his lance actually feels a\
  \ little steadier. Maybe it's the certainty. Maybe it's the absurdity. Either way, it helps.
FINGER_GUNS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry cracks a finger gun after every fight, no matter how bad\
  \ it got. It's habit, a ritual, a lifeline. Because if he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops} joking - if he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops} acting like\
  \ any of this is normal - then he'll have to face just how much of himself this war has taken.
FINGER_GUNS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just use finger guns ironically - he fully commits\
  \ to them. Affirmation? Finger guns. Acknowledgment? Finger guns. Encouragement? Double finger\
  \ guns with a nod for extra effect.
FINGER_GUNS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has an uncanny sense for when things are getting too\
  \ tense. Right before things boil over, he fires off a well-timed finger gun and a grin just wide\
  \ enough to throw people off. It shouldn't work - but it does.
FINGER_GUNS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry throws out a pair of finger guns like it's all under\
  \ control. Like things aren't crumbling, like the latest casualty report doesn't hurt, like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\

FLARE_DEPLOYER.label=Excessive NavPoint Use
FLARE_DEPLOYER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry drops so many NavPoints that his lance has learned to\

  \ rock, that one looks like my old instructor!"
FLARE_DEPLOYER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's tactical HUD is covered in NavPoints. Enemy positions,\
  \ possible hazards, ideal cover spots, backup escape routes - it's all plotted in real time. It's\
  \ excessive. It's cluttered. But somehow, he never gets lost, and he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} always in the right spot.
FLARE_DEPLOYER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's not just throwing down NavPoints for fun. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen\

  \ but because if he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} terrified he'll miss something important. And in war, one wrong\
  \ step means someone doesn't come home.
FLARE_DEPLOYER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just provide coordinates - he floods the system with\
  \ them. "Barry, we only needed a single NavPoint." "Yeah, but I thought you'd want a secondary, a\
  \ tertiary, and a contingency in case of sudden emergencies."
FLARE_DEPLOYER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry won't trust anyone to just remember directions. If there's\
  \ a system for marking locations, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} using it to the extreme. Maps, overlays, and digital\

FLARE_DEPLOYER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry isn't marking maps out of habit - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} doing it because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ been in situations where people got lost, where wrong turns led to death, where missing a\

FRIENDLY_INTERROGATOR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry isn't just nosy - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} paranoid. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen too many people\

  \ if the Black Marauder is real, if it's out there, then at least there's an answer. Even if it's\
  \ one no one wants to hear.

PASSIVE_LEADER.label=Leads Through Passivity
PASSIVE_LEADER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't bark commands, doesn't dictate tactics - he just\
  \ moves with purpose, and people follow. He {9, choice, 0#set|1#sets} an example, makes decisions without making a\
  \ show of it, and somehow, his lance ends up doing exactly what needs to be done. "I didn't tell\
  \ you what to do," he {9, choice, 0#shrug|1#shrugs}. "You just figured it out."
PASSIVE_LEADER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't force control - he lets things unfold. He waits,\
  \ watches, lets people make their own calls, and only steps in when absolutely necessary. "You\
  \ don't need me telling you what to do," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}. "You just need to know I'll step in when it\
  \ actually matters."
PASSIVE_LEADER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has watched too many commanders micromanage their teams\
  \ into disaster. He {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} that forcing leadership breeds hesitation - and hesitation gets people\
  \ killed. So he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} push. He just moves, acts, and hopes they trust him enough to follow.
PASSIVE_LEADER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry isn't in charge - but somehow, people listen to him anyway.\
  \ He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} make demands, doesn't give orders - he just does things the right way, and others end\
  \ up following his lead without realizing it.
PASSIVE_LEADER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry lets people struggle a little, lets them make their own\
  \ choices, lets them think they're leading themselves. And right when they need it, he offers\
  \ just enough of a push. "You got this," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}. "But if I were you, I'd check that system\
  \ first."
PASSIVE_LEADER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry refuses to be another voice barking orders. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen how\
  \ people break under too much control, how they stop thinking for themselves. So he leads\
  \ quietly, indirectly - because if they believe they're choosing to follow him, they'll actually\
  \ commit to it.

REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.label=Rebellious Without Cause
REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't outright refuse orders - but he always questions\
  \ them, always challenges them, always finds a way to make it clear that he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} choosing to follow,\
  \ not just obeying. "I could do it that way," he {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}. "Or I could do it my way - which, let's\
  \ be real, is probably better."
REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't follow rules because they're rules - he {9, choice, 0#follow|1#follows}\
  \ them if they make sense to him. Chain of command? Optional. Discipline? Situational. If someone\
  \ tries to pull rank on him without proving they deserve it, he'll make their life very difficult.
REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just push back for fun - he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ seen what happens when people follow orders without question. He {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to be another pawn,\
  \ another body thrown into the grinder. If he {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights}, if he {9, choice, 0#follow|1#follows}, it's his choice - not theirs.
REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't break major rules - just enough to be a problem.\
  \ Skipping unnecessary steps, bypassing bureaucracy, tweaking procedures because they annoy him.\
  \ "Look, it still works," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, grinning. "I just did it without all the nonsense."
REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't care if something is company policy, mission\
  \ standard, or "how things are done." If he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} agree with it, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} going to find a way\
  \ around it. "It's not rebellion," he {9, choice, 0#argue|1#argues}. "It's efficiency."
REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has watched too many people get crushed by systems that\
  \ never cared about them. So he resists - not for a cause, not for justice, but because it keeps\
  \ him from becoming another cog in the machine. If he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops} pushing back, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} afraid he'll lose\
  \ himself entirely.

SIMPLE_LIFE.label=Prefers Simple Solutions
SIMPLE_LIFE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't waste time with overcomplicated tactics. If the\
  \ objective is clear, so is the path to victory. "Why maneuver for fifteen minutes when we can\
  \ just hit them where it hurts?" If a problem has a straightforward answer, that's the one he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ taking.
SIMPLE_LIFE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry sees people spend too much time planning when the best\
  \ solution is just doing the obvious thing. "We could run three simulations, analyze terrain\
  \ variations, and draft contingencies... or we could just shoot the thing that's causing problems."
SIMPLE_LIFE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has watched lances waste time on complex strategies - and\
  \ seen them die before they could execute them. He {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} things simple because simple keeps\
  \ people alive. The more moving parts there are, the more ways everything can fall apart.
SIMPLE_LIFE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in unnecessary steps. If a task has five\
  \ stages, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} figuring out how to do it in two. If a system is too complicated, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} already\
  \ looking for a workaround. "Why do it this way when we could do it the easy way?"
SIMPLE_LIFE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry hates when people turn basic tasks into logistical\
  \ nightmares. If he {9, choice, 0#see|1#sees} someone struggling with pointless extra steps, he can't help but step\
  \ in. "Just do it like this - see? Done. No headaches. Why are we making this complicated?"
SIMPLE_LIFE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't simplify things out of laziness - he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it because\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen what happens when systems collapse under their own weight. The more complex something\
  \ is, the more likely it is to fail at the worst possible moment. Simple isn't just better - it's\
  \ safer.

ANTI_AUTHORITY.label=Distrusts Authority
ANTI_AUTHORITY.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't take orders at face value. If a superior gives a\
  \ command, his first instinct is to question why. "Are we sure that's not just a suicide mission\
  \ dressed up as a strategy?" He {9, choice, 0#follow|1#follows} orders - sometimes - but only when he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} convinced they\
  \ actually make sense.
ANTI_AUTHORITY.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust allied command, mission planners, or anyone\
  \ not risking their own skin. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen too many decisions made by people who never have to face\
  \ the consequences. "Oh, great, another 'brilliant strategy' from someone sitting in an\
  \ underground, reinforced bunker."
ANTI_AUTHORITY.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry used to trust the chain of command. But then he saw too\
  \ many bad calls, too many good people thrown away like resources. Now, he {9, choice, 0#assume|1#assumes} any order\
  \ could be the one that gets him - or his lance - killed for someone else's ambition.
ANTI_AUTHORITY.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in transparent leadership. If someone in\
  \ charge says everything is fine, his first instinct is to check for himself. "Oh, sure, no\
  \ problems at all - except for the dozen red flags you're ignoring."
ANTI_AUTHORITY.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't blindly follow procedures, policies, or team\
  \ initiatives. If leadership wants something done, they'd better have a real justification for\
  \ it. "I'm not ignoring common sense just because someone with a title says so."
ANTI_AUTHORITY.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen leadership make the wrong call, watched the\
  \ fallout, and buried the people who paid the price. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} assume those in charge are\
  \ evil - but he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} assume they're too distant to care what happens to people like him.

BLOODLUST.label=Thrives in Chaos
BLOODLUST.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry isn't just comfortable in chaotic battles - he {9, choice, 0#live|1#lives} for\
  \ them. When formations break, when plans crumble, when everything turns into an unpredictable\
  \ mess, that's when he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} at his best. "You're panicking? Relax. This is when things get fun."
BLOODLUST.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't freeze when things go sideways - he accelerates.\
  \ No hesitation, no second-guessing, just instinct and action. His lance watches him make\
  \ reckless choices that somehow always pay off. "Stop overthinking. Just move."
BLOODLUST.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just accept chaos - he expects it. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen too\
  \ many battles fall apart, too many plans shatter on contact with reality. The ones who survive?\
  \ They're the ones who stop trying to force order onto war and start embracing the madness.
BLOODLUST.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry is at his absolute best when things are at their worst.\
  \ When deadlines stack up, when systems crash, when everyone else is panicking, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} calmly\
  \ fixing six things at once. "Crisis? Nah, this is when I get stuff done."
BLOODLUST.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry struggles with routine but flourishes under pressure. If\
  \ everything is calm and stable, he {9, choice, 0#get|1#gets} bored. But the moment things start falling apart, he\
  \ snaps into focus. "I swear, you only work properly when the whole system is burning down."\
  \ Barry grins. "Well, yeah."
BLOODLUST.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has watched too many people break when their perfect plans\
  \ collapsed. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} believe in stability - he {9, choice, 0#believe|1#believes} in adapting to the inevitable disaster.\
  \ He thrives in chaos because, to him, chaos is the only thing that's ever truly reliable.

BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.label=Acts Bravely When Doubted
BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't take doubt as criticism - he {9, choice, 0#take|1#takes} it as a\
  \ challenge. The second someone questions if he can handle a fight, he {9, choice, 0#throw|1#throws} himself into it\
  \ headfirst. "Oh, you don't think I can do it? Watch me."
BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.description.1.COMBATANT=People assume Barry's too brash, too impulsive - but every time\
  \ someone underestimates him, he rises to the occasion. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} just survive impossible\
  \ situations - he thrives in them. "I don't need you to believe in me. I just need you to stay out\
  \ of my way."
BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry isn't fearless - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} terrified of being just another\
  \ warrior lost to history. He {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} like he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} something to prove, because if he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}, then\
  \ what was the point? When someone doubts him, he {9, choice, 0#take|1#takes} it personally. "You think I won't make\
  \ it? That's fine. I'll prove you wrong - or die trying."
BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't seek the spotlight, doesn't need to prove\
  \ himself - until someone implies he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} not up to the task. The moment someone says, "I don't think\
  \ you can pull this off," Barry immediately sets out to do exactly that.
BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry isn't the loudest person in the room, but if someone\
  \ questions his competence, he won't rest until he proves them wrong. "You said I couldn't fix\
  \ this in time? Well, I just did. So what now?"
BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just fight for respect - he {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} for recognition.\
  \ He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen what happens to the ones who blend into the background, the ones no one remembers\
  \ when the dust settles. If being doubted means pushing himself harder, then so be it. "You think\

CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.label=Obsesses over Duels
CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry can't go five minutes without bringing up legendary\
  \ duels. "Yeah, yeah, battlefield tactics are fine, but have you see Molotov vs. Indigo? That was\
  \ real combat." He {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} every famous match, every underdog story, every historic upset.
CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just watch duels - he models his entire combat\
  \ style after them. Flashy maneuvers, high-risk plays, individualist mentality - he {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} like\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} putting on a show, even in real warzones. "I don't just want to win - I want them to\
  \ remember me."
CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry knows real war is brutal, messy, and unfair. Arena \
  fights? They have rules, honor, a winner and a loser. He {9, choice, 0#cling|1#clings} to the idea that somewhere,\
  \ there's a version of combat where skill alone decides the outcome. Because if that's not true,\
  \ then what's the point of all of it?
CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't talk about politics, history, or strategy - he {9, choice, 0#talk|1#talks}\
  \ about the greatest arena fights of all time. He {9, choice, 0#remember|1#remembers} them move for move, can analyze every\
  \ mistake, and treats duelist legends like war heroes.
CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.description.1.SUPPORT=No matter what's happening, Barry finds a way to bring up arena\
  \ fights. "Oh, you think that's impressive? You should've seen the time War Dog ran a one-legged\
  \ Thunderbolt to victory against Black Mamba" He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} that kind of person.
CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry knows war is nothing like the arenas, but he wishes it\

  \ just entertainment instead of reality.

COOL_UNDER_FIRE.label=Remains Calm Under Fire
COOL_UNDER_FIRE.description.0.COMBATANT=Explosions, alarms, everything falling apart - Barry doesn't even\

COOL_UNDER_FIRE.description.1.SUPPORT=When the situation spirals out of control, Barry doesn't add to\

  \ like we always do."
COOL_UNDER_FIRE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen too many situations turn disastrous because\
  \ everyone panicked at the wrong moment. He {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to be that guy. If no one else can keep their\

CRASH_TEST.label=Purposely Tests Equipment Durability
CRASH_TEST.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just use his equipment - he abuses it. He {9, choice, 0#push|1#pushes}\
  \ everything past its rated limits, just to find out where they break. "If it fails now, that\
  \ means it would've failed in combat."
CRASH_TEST.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in manufacturer guarantees. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}\
  \ care what the specs say - he {9, choice, 0#need|1#needs} proof. So he {9, choice, 0#push|1#pushes} every piece of equipment past its redline,\
  \ just to make sure it holds up when it really matters. "If it survives me, it'll survive a\
  \ battlefield."
CRASH_TEST.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen the consequences of untested equipment failing\
  \ at the worst possible moment. A heat sink that should have handled the load, a weapon that\
  \ jammed when it mattered most. Now, he {9, choice, 0#break|1#breaks} things before battle - because if they fail in\
  \ testing, they won't fail when lives are on the line.
CRASH_TEST.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just check if something works - he {9, choice, 0#check|1#checks} if it can\
  \ survive abuse. He {9, choice, 0#run|1#runs} systems hotter, pushes components harder, and doesn't stop until\
  \ something fails spectacularly. "Oh, come on, it says it can handle this - so let's find out."
CRASH_TEST.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry refuses to sign off on anything until he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} personally\
  \ stress-tested it beyond reasonable limits. If a component is rated for ten tons of pressure,\

  \ actually kills it. "Better here than in the field."
CRASH_TEST.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen people die because a system failed under real\
  \ conditions. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} trust any spec sheet - he only trusts what he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} tested himself. If that\
  \ means he destroys some gear in the process, so be it. It's better than losing people because\
  \ someone trusted an untested number on a screen.

DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.label=Uses Deadpan Humor
DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry has a knack for perfectly-timed, emotionless one-liners.\
  \ Explosions in the distance? "Well, that sounds promising." Half his lance wiped out? "Guess\
  \ it's my turn, then." It's never clear if he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} joking, but it definitely helps break the tension.
DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't panic - he {9, choice, 0#make|1#makes} a dry remark and keeps moving.\
  \ "We're outnumbered ten to one." Barry nods. "Oh good, that's an even fight." His lance isn't\
  \ sure if he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} fearless or just too dead inside to care anymore.
DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry cracks emotionless jokes because if he stopped to process\
  \ everything, it might actually get to him. It's easier to act like it's all just a mildly\
  \ inconvenient joke than admit just how close they all are to dying at any given moment.
DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's reports always start with something grim. "Well,\
  \ everything's broken, we're running on fumes, and I assume command has already planned our\
  \ funerals." Pause. "Anyway, I patched the issue. It should be fine."
DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.description.1.SUPPORT=Emergency meeting? Barry's there with a straight face. "Oh,\
  \ don't worry. We're only mildly doomed." No one's sure if he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} joking. He never clarifies.
DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't laugh because nothing is actually funny anymore.\
  \ But if he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} make some kind of joke, then all that's left is the weight of everything\

DRILLS.label=Obsessed with Drills and Simulations
DRILLS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry treats every drill like it's life or death - because one\
  \ day, it will be. He {9, choice, 0#run|1#runs} combat sims until his lance hates him for it. "You think this is\
  \ excessive?" he {9, choice, 0#ask|1#asks}, dead serious. "Tell me that after we survive the real thing."
DRILLS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry lives for simulations. He {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} counter-strategies for\

  \ considered. "It's not paranoia," he {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}. "It's being ready."
DRILLS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has watched warriors die because they froze up, made a\
  \ bad call, or simply weren't prepared. Now, he drills relentlessly - because if he can burn\

DRILLS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry runs drills for everything - from emergency evacuations to\
  \ what to do if a DropShip crash-lands on HQ. His colleagues groan, but he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} care. "When it\

DRILLS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't trust any system, plan, or procedure unless it's\
  \ been tested to the breaking point. "If we haven't drilled it under pressure, then we don't know\
  \ if it actually works." And if that means running another sim? Then they're running another sim.
DRILLS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen people die because they hesitated. Because they\

GALLANT.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} with style. Whether it's a\

  \ memorable."
GALLANT.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry refuses to abandon his lance, even when it means putting\
  \ himself in danger. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} the one diving into enemy fire to pull a comrade out, the one holding\

GALLANT.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry fights with honor because he {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to become just\

GALLANT.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry approaches every task like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} leading a charge. Whether\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} repairing a system or handling logistics, he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it with the same pride and confidence as\

IRON_STOMACH.label=Can Eat Anything
IRON_STOMACH.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry has zero food standards. Expired rations? Still good.\
  \ Field scavenged supplies? Edible. Some questionable protein paste found in a destroyed base?\
  \ "If it doesn't kill me, it's food." His lance is horrified - he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} even hesitate before\

IRON_STOMACH.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry eats for survival, not pleasure. He'll consume anything\

  \ "Food is fuel," he {9, choice, 0#shrug|1#shrugs}, gnawing on something vaguely resembling jerky. "Doesn't matter what\

IRON_STOMACH.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't complain about food because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} been through\
  \ worse. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} starved before. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} had weeks where meals weren't an option. So if it's even\

  \ all.
IRON_STOMACH.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't care if the meal is burned, over-processed, or\

IRON_STOMACH.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't waste time worrying about taste because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen\

MISSION_CRITIC.label=Hyper-Critical of Mission Plans
MISSION_CRITIC.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just hear a mission briefing - he dissects it.\
  \ Before command even finishes talking, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} already identified every weak point, every flaw, and\

  \ Because it will fail."
MISSION_CRITIC.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just trust a plan because it came from higher up\
  \ the chain. He {9, choice, 0#need|1#needs} to see it work. If he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} not convinced, he'll grill leadership until they\
  \ either justify it or fix it. "I'm not running a mission just because someone in a suit thinks\
  \ it should work."
MISSION_CRITIC.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry used to trust mission briefings - until he saw too many bad\

MISSION_CRITIC.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry isn't trying to be difficult - he just refuses to accept\

MISSION_CRITIC.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry believes every strategy should be tested, retested, and\

MISSION_CRITIC.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen too many missions fail because someone didn't ask\
  \ enough questions. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} criticize plans for fun - he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it because he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} that bad\

NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.label=Believes in "No Pain, No Gain"
NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in taking it easy. Every drill, every\

  \ doesn't count. "You're sore? Good. That means you're improving."
NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.description.1.COMBATANT=To Barry, pain isn't a problem - it's proof he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} still alive. He\

  \ it's supposed to. If you want to be better, you learn to live with it."
NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen what happens to warriors who hesitate when\
  \ things get rough. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} believe in comfort, in taking it slow, in waiting until conditions\
  \ are right. War doesn't care if you're hurting. Either you push through it, or you die.
NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't trust easy solutions. If something isn't a\

  \ it's not worth doing."
NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in shortcuts, doesn't sympathize with\

NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has watched people break because they weren't ready to\

PERSONAL_ARMORY.label=Keeps a Personal Armory
PERSONAL_ARMORY.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just have weapons - he {9, choice, 0#collect|1#collects} them. Laser\

  \ depot. "You say 'overkill,' I say 'being prepared for any situation.'"
PERSONAL_ARMORY.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust standard-issue gear - he prefers his own\
  \ meticulously maintained, custom-modified weapons. Each one has a purpose, a history, and a\
  \ reason for being in his collection. "Command says 'stick to regs.' Command can borrow my\
  \ backups when theirs fail."
PERSONAL_ARMORY.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't hoard weapons for fun - he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\

PERSONAL_ARMORY.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't think being support staff means being unarmed.\
  \ He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} got sidearms stashed in toolkits, a shotgun behind a supply crate, and at least one\
  \ knife strapped somewhere no one expects. "Look, I don't plan for things to go south - I just make\

PERSONAL_ARMORY.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in the idea of 'safe zones.' He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen\

QUICK_ADAPTER.label=Adapts Quickly to New Situations

QUICK_ADAPTER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't panic when things don't go according to mission\

  \ enemy does. "They changed their tactics? Good. That means I get to change mine too."
QUICK_ADAPTER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't have the luxury of overthinking. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} watched\

QUICK_ADAPTER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't panic when systems fail, supplies run out, or\

QUICK_ADAPTER.description.1.SUPPORT=New tech, new protocols, new disasters - Barry absorbs them all\

QUICK_ADAPTER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't trust stability. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen entire operations fall\

  \ never forgets it. "You thought I'd forget what you did? That's adorable."
RETALIATOR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in forgiveness in war. If someone gets\

SILENT_PROTECTOR.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't expect thanks, doesn't make a scene, doesn't draw\

  \ fights, or just going on about something unrelated mid-skirmish. "You ever wonder if our\
  \ DropShips are just really expensive coffins? No? Just me? Cool."
CHATTERBOX.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry fills the silence because silence means thinking. And\
  \ thinking means remembering. And remembering means realizing how bad things really are. So\
  \ instead, he just keeps talking. About anything. Because if he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}, what's left?
CHATTERBOX.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just work - he {9, choice, 0#talk|1#talks} through the process. "Okay, so\
  \ now we recalibrate the system - oh wow, this is a mess, who even installed this? - anyway, now we\
  \ just... and boom, fixed it."
CHATTERBOX.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't need an audience to talk - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} perfectly fine\
  \ talking to himself. But if someone is nearby? Even better. "Did you know that if this system\
  \ fails, we all die horribly? Just saying. Anyway, how's your day?"
CHATTERBOX.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry knows what it means when people stop talking. It means\
  \ they're tired, broken, or already lost. He {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to let that happen to himself - or anyone\
  \ else. If he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} to be the one keeping things loud and alive, then that's exactly what he'll do.

COMBAT_ARTIST.label=Combat as Art Form
COMBAT_ARTIST.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he creates. Every shot, every\
  \ maneuver, every strike is deliberate, practiced, and flawless. "Anyone can pull a trigger. A\
  \ real warrior makes it look good."
COMBAT_ARTIST.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just survive battles - he flows through them,\
  \ treating combat like a perfectly choreographed dance. Every step, every feint, every\
  \ counterattack is fluid, seamless, and effortless. "War isn't just about winning - it's about how\
  \ you win."
COMBAT_ARTIST.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't fight like a brute, because he {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to believe\
  \ war is just violence for violence's sake. If he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} turn it into something greater, into\
  \ art, then what is it? Just murder. And he can't let himself believe that's all there is.
COMBAT_ARTIST.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just see war as strategy - he {9, choice, 0#see|1#sees} it as expression.\
  \ He {9, choice, 0#study|1#studies} legendary duels, dissects perfect maneuvers, and talks about battles like they\
  \ belong in a museum. "That last engagement? Pure artistry. You don't just see skill like that\
  \ every day."
COMBAT_ARTIST.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry applies his artistic philosophy to everything. If\
  \ something isn't precise, efficient, and elegant, he disapproves.
COMBAT_ARTIST.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry romanticizes war because he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} to. If he lets himself see\
  \ it as just blood, destruction, and suffering, he might not be able to justify his role in it\
  \ anymore. So instead, he {9, choice, 0#see|1#sees} it as a craft, an art, something worth perfecting. Because if war\

DARING_ESCAPE.label=Specializes in Daring Escapes
DARING_ESCAPE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just retreat - he orchestrates an escape with\
  \ flair. Smoke, misdirection, last-second maneuvers - he {9, choice, 0#turn|1#turns} what should be a desperate flight\
  \ into something that looks almost effortless. "You call it running. I call it leaving\
  \ dramatically."
DARING_ESCAPE.description.1.COMBATANT=When things go south, Barry's already two steps ahead. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} the\

  \ always a way out. You just have to be willing to take it."
DARING_ESCAPE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't escape because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} afraid - he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it because\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen what happens when people refuse to retreat. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} learned that sometimes, the\
  \ difference between living and dying is knowing when to run. And he never hesitates when that\
  \ time comes.
DARING_ESCAPE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't trust any situation to stay safe for long. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\

  \ "You laugh now, but when everything goes to hell, I'll be the one getting out alive."
DARING_ESCAPE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has an uncanny ability to disappear from dangerous,\
  \ awkward, or annoying situations. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} the first one to duck out of a failing meeting, the one\
  \ who always finds the shortest line, the best exit, the quickest solution. "I don't run. I\
  \ strategically disengage."
DARING_ESCAPE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't wait for rescue, doesn't trust that someone will\
  \ come for him. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen too many people left behind, too many desperate last stands that led\
  \ nowhere. So he {9, choice, 0#make|1#makes} sure he always {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} a way out. Because in war, survivors aren't always the\

DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.label=Doomsday Prepper

DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry stockpiles and prepares because he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} that wars don't\

DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't trust any system to work forever. He {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} redundant\

  \ know about. "Oh, the main reactor failed? Good thing I stashed a spare energy cell where no one\
  \ thought to look."
DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has hidden stockpiles everywhere. Rations in the storage\
  \ bay, extra weapons in unmarked crates, an escape route planned for any disaster. People think\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} paranoid - until the first real crisis hits. "What do you mean you didn't pack three months'\
  \ worth of emergency food?"
DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry prepares not because he expects help, but because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ learned that help doesn't come. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen entire outposts abandoned, warriors cut off and left\

EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.label=Scavenges for Gear
EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he loots. Every battle is a chance to\

  \ figuring out how to use it. "Waste not, want not. That guy's not using his boots anymore, so I\
  \ will."
EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't rely on supply chains. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} patched together\

  \ survival tools. "You trust requisitions. I trust whatever I can pull off a wrecked war machine."
EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has run dry before - been left without ammo, without\

  \ the day will come when no one is resupplying him. And when that day comes? He'll be the only\

EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry hoards spare parts, salvages damaged equipment, and can\
  \ fix a system using components that no one else thought were worth keeping. "You were gonna\
  \ throw this away? I just made it fully operational again."
EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has stashes everywhere. A forgotten crate of munitions, a\

  \ wrong, he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} what's needed. "Oh, now you need the part I 'shouldn't have taken'? Funny how\
  \ that works."
EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't scavenge for fun - he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it because he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows}\
  \ supplies don't last forever. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen bases stripped bare, troops left defenseless, entire\

FRIEND_TO_FOES.label=Sympathetic to Enemies
FRIEND_TO_FOES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't fight with hatred - he {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} because he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} to. He\
  \ recognizes that the people on the other side aren't so different from him. "They've got orders.\
  \ We've got orders. The difference is who's left standing at the end."
FRIEND_TO_FOES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry isn't the type to shoot a retreating enemy, nor does he\
  \ take pleasure in victory. He {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} only as much as necessary. "Not every enemy deserves to\
  \ die. Some of them are just trying to survive - same as us."
FRIEND_TO_FOES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry understands that war is politics, not personal. If things\
  \ had played out just a little differently, he might have been wearing their colors, following\
  \ their orders, killing his own people. That thought haunts him every time he {9, choice, 0#pull|1#pulls} the trigger.
FRIEND_TO_FOES.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry studies enemy tactics, but not just for strategic\
  \ reasons - he {9, choice, 0#want|1#wants} to understand them. Their history, their motivations, their art. "You to beat\
  \ them? Try understanding why they're fighting in the first place."
FRIEND_TO_FOES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't see war as black and white. He {9, choice, 0#believe|1#believes} that if\
  \ things changed, if people actually listened instead of just fighting endlessly, maybe they\
  \ wouldn't have to be enemies forever. "We've fought with worse people than them before. Who says\

FRIEND_TO_FOES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in good guys and bad guys anymore. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\

GUNG_HO.label=Gung-Ho Attitude

GUNG_HO.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry thrives in the chaos of war, treating every mission as a\

  \ idea? Good. That makes it more fun."
GUNG_HO.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry pushes forward relentlessly, not just because he {9, choice, 0#enjoy|1#enjoys}\
  \ combat, but because slowing down means thinking. And thinking means acknowledging just how much\
  \ this war has taken from him.
GUNG_HO.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't hesitate - he just acts. System failure? He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} on it\
  \ before anyone finishes panicking. Major logistical issue? Already moving to fix it. "Less\

GUNG_HO.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry takes on every task with full force. If there's a problem,\

GUNG_HO.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't stop moving because stopping means facing reality.\

INSPIRATIONAL_POET.label=Gives Inspirational Speeches
INSPIRATIONAL_POET.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just talk - he commands attention. Before a battle,\

INSPIRATIONAL_POET.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't let fear or doubt take hold - not on his watch.\
  \ When morale is at its lowest, when the enemy seems unstoppable, he {9, choice, 0#stand|1#stands} tall, spitting\

INSPIRATIONAL_POET.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in blind optimism, but he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen what\

INSPIRATIONAL_POET.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry isn't just there to do his job - he holds people together.\

MEK_MATCHMAKER.label=Believes in 'Mek Compatibility

MEK_MATCHMAKER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry can't fully prove his belief in machine compatibility, but\

  \ improve when paired with the right unit. "It's not just equipment - it's a bond."
MEK_MATCHMAKER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry insists that machines have quirks, and some people sync\
  \ with them better than others. He notices who flows naturally with their unit and who is\
  \ constantly fighting it. "You don't just control it - you work with it. And if that doesn't\
  \ happen, you're in the wrong machine."
MEK_MATCHMAKER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't buy into standard assignments or universal\

MISSILE_JUNKIE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just win fights - he ensures absolute destruction.\

  \ plays, because in his mind, he {9, choice, 0#were|1#was} never going to make it out of this war alive anyway.
RISK_TAKER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry never follows standard procedure when a faster, more\
  \ dangerous approach exists. He tests theories mid-operation, takes huge gambles on untested\
  \ ideas, and never waits for permission. "Calculated risks? Boring. Let's just see what happens."
RISK_TAKER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry hates slow, cautious approaches. If there's a shortcut\
  \ that might work, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} taking it. If there's a wild, untested alternative, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} all in. "Yeah,\
  \ yeah, it might backfire. But if it doesn't, we just saved a ton of time."
RISK_TAKER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't trust careful planning because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen how\

SIGNATURE_MOVE.label=Has a Signature Move
SIGNATURE_MOVE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he {9, choice, 0#perform|1#performs}. Every battle, every\
  \ engagement, he executes his move, something distinct, unmistakable, his own. "If they survive,\
  \ they'll remember exactly who did it."
SIGNATURE_MOVE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't care if it's tactically efficient - what matters is\
  \ style, impact, and recognition. If he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} going to win, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} going to do it his way. "If they\
  \ don't know it's me by how I fight, then I'm not fighting right."
SIGNATURE_MOVE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just want to win - he {9, choice, 0#want|1#wants} to be remembered. He\

  \ technique, his legacy, his name will live on. "If I fall, they'll still be talking about me\
  \ years from now."
SIGNATURE_MOVE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just do things - he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} them his way. Whether it's\
  \ a specific technique, a ritualized habit, or an unmistakable style, everything he {9, choice, 0#touch|1#touches} feels\
  \ like him. "If you don't recognize my work when you see it, then I'm doing something wrong."
SIGNATURE_MOVE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't believe in generic solutions. His way of solving\
  \ problems, fixing things, or handling challenges is something unique to him - and it always works.\
  \ "Anyone can do the job. I make it look good while I'm at it."
SIGNATURE_MOVE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen too many people fade into nothing, their stories,\
  \ their impact erased by time and war. He {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to be just another worker, just another body.\

TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.label=Withdraws from Conflict
TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't see retreat as cowardice - he {9, choice, 0#see|1#sees} it as strategy.\
  \ If a fight isn't worth it, if there's a smarter way out, he'll take it. "Survival isn't about\
  \ winning every fight. It's about knowing which ones to walk away from."
TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't engage in pointless fights. He {9, choice, 0#pick|1#picks} his moments,\
  \ waits for the right time, and doesn't waste energy on clashes that don't matter. "Let them wear\
  \ themselves out. I'll be here when it actually matters."
TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't withdraw because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} afraid - he withdraws because\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} tired. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen too many fights, too much bloodshed, and he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} how easily lives are\
  \ thrown away for nothing. If he {9, choice, 0#walk|1#walks} away, it's because he values his survival more than\
  \ someone else's idea of honor.
TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't waste his time on pointless debates or petty\
  \ disputes. He'll listen, nod, and then quietly walk away, letting others fight while he {9, choice, 0#move|1#moves}\
  \ on. "You all let me know when you're done yelling. I'll be over here actually getting things\
  \ done."
TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has no patience for drama, politics, or endless conflicts.\
  \ If something is going nowhere, he {9, choice, 0#remove|1#removes} himself before it can drag him down too. "You want to\
  \ argue for hours? Be my guest. I've got better things to do."
TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has watched people destroy themselves over pointless\
  \ grudges, needless rivalries, and unwinnable battles. He {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to become another casualty to\
  \ someone else's pride. If stepping away means staying alive, then that's exactly what he'll do.

ACCENT_SWITCHER.label=Switches Accents Randomly
ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's speech patterns are completely unpredictable. One\
  \ moment, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} speaking with a crisp, formal tone; the next, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} dropped into a thick drawl or\
  \ clipped military jargon. "Aye, lad, ye best watch yer flank - oh, wait, I mean, move your ass\
  \ before they frag you."
ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry never explains why he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it, but he'll slip into\
  \ different accents at the worst possible times. It's hard to tell if it's deliberate\
  \ misdirection or just habit. "Reckon we hit 'em hard, real cowboy style - or perhaps a more\
  \ refined approach is in order, oui?"
ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has spent too long in too many places, surrounded by too\
  \ many different voices. He {9, choice, 0#pick|1#picks} up accents without thinking, blending in, shifting, changing.\
  \ If he still remembers his real voice, he never {9, choice, 0#let|1#lets} it show. "I've been a lot of people. I\
  \ don't even know which one's actually me anymore."
ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's colleagues have given up trying to figure out his\
  \ origins. One day he sounds like a noble diplomat, the next he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} speaking like he just walked\
  \ out of a frontier settlement. "Oh, sugar, don't worry none, I got it fixed - wait, pardon,\
  \ monsieur, I meant to say, the issue has been resolved."
ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't even realize when he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it. Sometimes he'll slip\
  \ into an accent mid-conversation and act like nothing happened. When called out on it? He just\
  \ shrugs. "Well, ain't that just your perception, mate?"
ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't force the accent changes - they happen on their own.\
  \ He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} lived too many lives, in too many places, and his voice reflects all of them. It's not a\
  \ quirk - it's a reminder that he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} never really belonged anywhere for long.

AMBUSH_LOVER.label=Walks Softly
AMBUSH_LOVER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't stomp around like others do. His footsteps are\
  \ light, calculated, deliberate. One moment, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} across the room; the next, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} right behind\
  \ you. "You hear that? No? Exactly."
AMBUSH_LOVER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't see the point in announcing his presence. Every\
  \ movement is controlled, every step soft. While others crash forward, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} already maneuvering\
  \ unseen. "Loud gets you killed. Quiet lets you choose when to strike."
AMBUSH_LOVER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen enough ambushes, enough betrayals, enough\
  \ slaughter to know that noise only makes you a target. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} move loudly because he still\
  \ wants to be alive at the end of the day. "The moment they hear you, they've already decided\
  \ you're dead."
AMBUSH_LOVER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry moves without sound, without warning, and it startles\
  \ everyone. One second the room is empty; the next, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} just there. "I swear, Barry, you've got\
  \ to stop sneaking up on people." "...I walked in like normal."
AMBUSH_LOVER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't intentionally lurk, but he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} quiet enough that\
  \ people constantly forget he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} around. Conversations stop abruptly when he finally talks. "Oh,\
  \ wow - Barry, I didn't even know you were here." "Yeah. I get that a lot."
AMBUSH_LOVER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't move loudly because he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} better. Being heard,\
  \ being seen, being noticed? That's just an invitation for trouble. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} learned that the longer\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#stay|1#stays} quiet, the more likely he {9, choice, 0#are|1#is} to make it through whatever's coming next. "The moment\
  \ they forget you're there, you've already won."

BATTLE_HARDENED.label=Battle-Hardened Stoic
BATTLE_HARDENED.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't flinch at incoming fire, surprise ambushes, or\
  \ desperate last stands. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} been through worse, and he never {9, choice, 0#let|1#lets} it show. "Panic won't save\
  \ you. Keep moving."
BATTLE_HARDENED.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't waste words on complaints, bravado, or false\
  \ hope. He {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights}, he endures, he survives, and that's all there is to it. "Talk later. Fight\
  \ now."
BATTLE_HARDENED.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't let himself feel anymore, not like he used to.\
  \ He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} watched too many people die, too many wars grind on without meaning. If he {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops} to\
  \ process it, it'll break him. So he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}. "Keep your head down. Keep moving. Nothing else\
  \ matters."
BATTLE_HARDENED.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry stays calm under pressure, never raising his voice, never\
  \ letting stress crack through. Alarms blaring? Still focused. People panicking? He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} already\
  \ handling the problem. "Losing your head won't fix it. Focus."
BATTLE_HARDENED.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't whine, grumble, or overreact. If something is bad,\
  \ he deals with it. If something is really bad, he deals with it harder. "Yeah. It's bad. So fix\
  \ it."
BATTLE_HARDENED.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry used to care, used to feel. But war doesn't care, and\
  \ eventually, he learned to stop wasting energy on emotions no one had time for. If something's\
  \ wrong, he fixes it. If something hurts, he {9, choice, 0#push|1#pushes} through it. "Pain means you're still alive.\
  \ That's all it means."

BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.label=Breaks Radio Silence
BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry understands the importance of stealth and discipline, but\
  \ he just can't help himself. The lance is moving in total silence when suddenly: "Hey, anyone\
  \ else think this is way too quiet?"
BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry hates absolute silence. It makes his skin crawl, sets his\
  \ nerves on edge. He'll risk whispering, muttering, or making a joke just to break the tension.\
  \ "Radio's dead silent? Yeah, okay, now I'm worried."
BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has been there - the silence stretching on too long, the\
  \ slow realization that no one's responding. If he {9, choice, 0#speak|1#speaks}, it's because he {9, choice, 0#need|1#needs} to hear someone\
  \ answer back. "Someone say something. Just... anything. I don't care what."
BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry knows when to keep his mouth shut. He just doesn't care.\
  \ If the channel is dead silent for too long, he'll drop in with something completely unnecessary.\
  \ "Sooo... what do you think the chances are that we aren't walking into a trap?"
BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't like silence. It feels unnatural, wrong, too\
  \ empty. If no one else is talking, he'll fill the void, even if it gets him in trouble. "Okay,\
  \ but hypothetically, if I were to just start humming right now - "
BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry knows exactly what it feels like to wait on the other end\
  \ of a dead radio, to call out and hear nothing in return. He {9, choice, 0#talk|1#talks} because if he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't}, he'll\
  \ start wondering if he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} the last one left. "Radio check. Someone say something. Now."

CONVOY_LOVER.label=Prefers Convoy Missions
CONVOY_LOVER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't see convoy missions as boring logistics - he {9, choice, 0#see|1#sees}\
  \ them as a real test of skill. Protecting a moving force, managing ambush points, bottlenecks,\
  \ and chokepoints - to him, that's the real game. "Stationary fights are predictable. Convoy\
  \ missions? That's where you prove you know what you're doing."
CONVOY_LOVER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry likes that convoy missions matter. There's something\
  \ different about ensuring something critical gets through, rather than just destroying a target.\
  \ "You're not just fighting to win. You're fighting to deliver something that matters."
CONVOY_LOVER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has watched convoy missions go horribly wrong. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen\
  \ supply lines torn apart, civilian transports ambushed, key assets lost forever. He {9, choice, 0#take|1#takes} them\
  \ personally now. "Convoy's getting through. No matter what. No matter what."
CONVOY_LOVER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry enjoys the rhythm of a convoy. The movement, the\
  \ preparation, the precision. There's something about logistics in motion that makes sense to\
  \ him. "Nothing's better than a well-organized convoy rolling like a well-oiled machine."
CONVOY_LOVER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just care about getting somewhere - he {9, choice, 0#enjoy|1#enjoys} the\
  \ process of getting there. The planning, the movement, the sense of progress. "A base is just a\
  \ place. The mission? That's a story unfolding in real time."
CONVOY_LOVER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry understands that war isn't won by battles - it's won by\
  \ supply lines. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen what happens when a convoy doesn't make it. He {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} that everything\
  \ collapses when the supplies stop coming. "Fights don't matter if the people fighting don't have\
  \ what they need. Convoy goes through. End of discussion."

CAMOUFLAGE.label=Likes to Blend In
CAMOUFLAGE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he {9, choice, 0#make|1#makes} sure his gear is invisible\
  \ until it's too late. From terrain-matching coatings to active concealment tricks, he {9, choice, 0#take|1#takes}\
  \ hiding his equipment as seriously as he {9, choice, 0#take|1#takes} the fight itself. "If they don't see it coming,\
  \ they don't get a chance to react. That's the whole point."
CAMOUFLAGE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't believe in standard color schemes or obvious\
  \ silhouettes. His equipment always matches the terrain - dust-covered in deserts, ice-slicked in\
  \ tundras, urban-camouflaged in cities. "Standing out is just asking to get shot first."
CAMOUFLAGE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has watched people die because they stood out, because\
  \ their gear wasn't hidden well enough. He learned the hard way that survival is about not being\
  \ seen at all. "If they see you first, you're already dead. Hide everything. Always."
CAMOUFLAGE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry refuses to leave anything exposed. He'll cover, blend, and\
  \ disguise anything that could be spotted from a distance. If something stands out, he fixes it\
  \ immediately. "Survival starts with us not being noticed at all."
CAMOUFLAGE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry moves through situations without fanfare. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} not\
  \ invisible, but people rarely notice when he arrives or leaves - just that things seem to run more\
  \ smoothly when he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} around. "Oh, Barry was here? Yeah. That makes sense."
CAMOUFLAGE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has watched others rise up, make names for themselves - only\
  \ to be cut down first when things go bad. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} learned that staying unnoticed is the safest way\
  \ to survive. "The nail that sticks out gets hammered down. I prefer not to be the nail."

DISTANT_LEADER.label=Leads from a Distance
DISTANT_LEADER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't shout orders from the front - he positions himself\
  \ where he can see everything, analyzing movements, making precise calls. "You don't lead by\
  \ charging in. You lead by making sure everyone gets through alive."
DISTANT_LEADER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't need spotlights, titles, or recognition to lead.\
  \ His voice is calm, his directions are measured, and he ensures his team is always positioned\
  \ for success. "I don't need to be in front. I just need to be in control of the field."
DISTANT_LEADER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry knows what happens to leaders who put themselves in the\
  \ thick of every fight. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} buried too many of them. He {9, choice, 0#stay|1#stays} just far enough back to keep\
  \ control, to make sure his people don't die for nothing. "You want to be the hero? Go ahead.\
  \ I'll make sure the rest of us survive."
DISTANT_LEADER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't hover or demand attention - he {9, choice, 0#set|1#sets} things in\
  \ motion, gives clear direction, and lets things unfold as planned. "You don't need to be in the\
  \ middle of everything to keep it running. You just need to know how to steer it from where you\
  \ are."
DISTANT_LEADER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry is the kind of person who gives advice, direction, and\
  \ strategy, then steps right back into the background. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} need people to follow him\
  \ explicitly - he just makes sure they know where to go. "I don't need credit. I just need this to\
  \ work."
DISTANT_LEADER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has seen leaders charge forward and never come back. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ watched too many put themselves at the center of things and get ripped apart. He {9, choice, 0#stay|1#stays} where he\
  \ can be most useful, which means not dying for a symbol. "I lead from here because if I don't,\
  \ there won't be anyone left to lead."

DRAMATIC_FINISH.label=Prefers Dramatic Finishes
DRAMATIC_FINISH.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just win - he {9, choice, 0#make|1#makes} sure everyone remembers how he\
  \ won. He times his final moves perfectly, adding a sense of style to every encounter. "Anyone\
  \ can win. Not everyone can make it look good."
DRAMATIC_FINISH.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry knows the fight is his, but he waits - lining up the\
  \ perfect shot, setting up a final strike that leaves no doubt. If it doesn't feel cinematic, it\
  \ wasn't done right. "It's not just about beating them. It's about ending it in a way they'll\
  \ never forget."
DRAMATIC_FINISH.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry refuses to let his fights be just another skirmish. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ seen too many battles blend together, too many victories that feel hollow. If he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} going to\
  \ fight, then the ending better damn well be worth it. "If this is going to be another day of\

DRAMATIC_FINISH.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just complete things - he ensures that the ending\

  \ knows how to leave an impression. "No, no, no. You can't just finish it. You have to stick the\
  \ landing."
DRAMATIC_FINISH.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry hates anticlimaxes. If something is wrapping up, he will\
  \ make sure it happens with flare, weight, and the perfect sense of timing. "You don't just fade\
  \ out. You make sure the last thing they see is the part they'll remember."
DRAMATIC_FINISH.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has watched people disappear, missions end without\
  \ closure, lives lost without significance. He {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to let his own moments fade into\
  \ obscurity. Every ending needs impact - because if it doesn't, then what was the point of\

ENGINE_REVERER.label=Emphatic with Technology
ENGINE_REVERER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't see machines as lifeless tools - he {9, choice, 0#treat|1#treats} them\
  \ with respect, patience, and understanding. He {9, choice, 0#swear|1#swears} his weapons fight better when he\
  \ acknowledges them properly. "A machine isn't just metal and circuits. It knows when you trust\
  \ it - and when you don't."
ENGINE_REVERER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry has seen too many people abuse their gear, rush their\
  \ startup sequences, ignore the warning hum of a system under stress. He {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to do the same.\
  \ "You listen to it, you learn from it, and it will take care of you in return."
ENGINE_REVERER.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't think failures are random. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} watched unworthy\

  \ their moment of need. "Call it superstition. But if you don't show your machine respect, one\
  \ day, it won't be there when you need it most."
ENGINE_REVERER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry never just interacts with technology - he communicates with\
  \ it. Whether it's a quick word of encouragement, a gentle pat on the side of a console, or a\
  \ quiet thank you, he {9, choice, 0#believe|1#believes} it matters. "You'd be amazed what a little appreciation does.\
  \ Machines like being treated well."
ENGINE_REVERER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry swears different machines have different moods. Some are\
  \ stubborn, some are temperamental, and some respond to kindness. If something refuses to work,\
  \ he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} assume it's broken - he {9, choice, 0#assume|1#assumes} it's upset. "Give it a second. It's just being\
  \ difficult today. Happens to everyone."
ENGINE_REVERER.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry knows too many people who treated their machines like\
  \ soulless tools - and they're gone now. Maybe it's coincidence. Maybe it's not. But he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} not going\

FLIRTY_COMMS.label=Flirts Over Comms

  \ for saving your ass just now."
FLIRTY_COMMS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry knows the situation is serious, but that doesn't mean he\

FLIRTY_COMMS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has a gift for casually throwing out flirtatious remarks\

FOCUS_FREAK.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry might be laid back or unfocused when things are normal,\
  \ but when things start falling apart, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} suddenly the most competent person in the room. No\

FOCUS_FREAK.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry shuts out distractions, ignores the noise, and locks in on\

FOCUS_FREAK.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't focus because he {9, choice, 0#want|1#wants} to - he {9, choice, 0#focus|1#focuses} because\

FOUL_MOUTHED.label=Foul-Mouthed
FOUL_MOUTHED.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's comms are a constant stream of expletives, whether he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ frustrated, excited, or just having a normal conversation. His insults are creative, effective,\
  \ and completely unfiltered. "Oh, for ****'s sake, that's the worst shooting I've ever seen! Do\
  \ I need to ****ing hold your hand out here?"
FOUL_MOUTHED.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just swear - he weaponizes it. His profanity is so\
  \ aggressive that it either rallies his allies or completely rattles his enemies. "Listen here,\
  \ you miserable pack of rusted ****-stains, either you run now or I'll show you what a real\
  \ ****ing disaster looks like."
FOUL_MOUTHED.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry used to care about how he spoke, about keeping things\
  \ professional. But war has burned that away. Now, his language is raw, brutal, and\
  \ honest - because what's the point in holding back? "I don't have time for your ****ing optimism.\
  \ We're knee-deep in **** and unless you stop talking and start shooting, we're going to die in\
  \ it."
FOUL_MOUTHED.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry can't do anything without a few choice words. Whether he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\

FOUL_MOUTHED.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's tone barely changes between casual conversation and\

FOUL_MOUTHED.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't dress things up, doesn't soften the truth. He\

FREESTYLE_COMBAT.label=Has a Freestyle Approach
FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't do structured plans or textbook strategies. He\
  \ improvises on the fly, adjusting as the fight unfolds, reacting faster than anyone expects.\
  \ "Look, I could follow protocol, or I could just do what actually works. Guess which one I'm\
  \ picking?"
FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry trusts instinct over orders, flow over formation. His\
  \ style is chaotic but effective, and somehow, it keeps working. "Plans fall apart. Tactics get\
  \ countered. You know what doesn't? Thinking faster than the other guy."
FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry used to follow orders, used to stick to the doctrine. But\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} watched it fail, seen people die because they did what they were told instead of what\
  \ actually needed to be done. Now? He adapts, or he dies. "You want me to follow the plan\
  \ exactly? Then tell me how that worked out for the last poor bastard who tried it."
FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't care about standard procedures or official\
  \ methods. If there's a faster, more efficient, or completely unconventional way to do something,\

FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has no patience for needless steps or bureaucratic\

  \ want a process? Fine. Here's my process: I make it work."
FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't trust manuals, procedures, or carefully written\
  \ guidelines. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen too many people waste time following the rules while everything burned\
  \ around them. He {9, choice, 0#work|1#works} fast, loose, and with no hesitation - because that's what keeps people\

  \ survive this."

GEOMETRY_GURU.label=Geometry Guru
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he {9, choice, 0#calculate|1#calculates}. Every shot, every\
  \ movement, every approach is based on angles, arcs, and positioning. "You don't just fire - you\
  \ predict. You don't just move - you control the space."
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry never fires blindly; every shot is lined up, ricocheted,\
  \ or angled for maximum impact. He {9, choice, 0#treat|1#treats} the battlefield like a perfectly plotted\
  \ three-dimensional puzzle. "Everything has a weak spot. You just have to find the right angle to\
  \ exploit it."
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust luck, instinct, or blind aggression. He\

  \ angles? Angles don't lie. "It's not about winning. It's about solving for X. And in this case,\
  \ X is the fastest way to make them not my problem."
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry can't unsee geometry in everything. The way things align,\
  \ the way efficiency improves when angles are perfect, the mathematical beauty of well-organized\
  \ space. "You don't just put things down randomly. You optimize them."
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has a habit of breaking down even the simplest things into\
  \ mathematical terms. Whether it's lining up objects, explaining movement patterns, or analyzing\
  \ layouts, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} always thinking in angles. "Look, you could do it that way, but if you shift it\
  \ 17 degrees, you'll maximize efficiency by at least 12%."
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry finds comfort in numbers, angles, and predictable\
  \ calculations because everything else is chaos. He can't control the war, the losses, the\
  \ destruction - but he can control how things align, how things flow, how everything fits into\
  \ place. "The world falls apart, people die, plans fail. But geometry? Geometry is perfect."

ICE_COLD.label=Emotionless in Crisis
ICE_COLD.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't panic, doesn't flinch, doesn't react to chaos\

ICE_COLD.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry speaks in the same steady, flat tone whether he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} giving\

  \ deliberate, even as everything around him burns. "We handle it. That's all. Doesn't matter how\
  \ bad it looks."
ICE_COLD.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has watched panic kill more people than bullets. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ buried leaders who froze up, warriors who hesitated, teams who lost control. He learned long\

  \ I'll deal with it. Because I always do."
ICE_COLD.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't rush, panic, or even raise his voice when things\
  \ go wrong. He simply assesses the problem, executes the next step, and moves forward. "Crisis?\
  \ No. It's just a situation that needs handling."
ICE_COLD.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's voice stays calm and even while everyone else is losing\
  \ their minds. It doesn't matter how bad things get - his response is always unshaken, controlled,\
  \ and matter-of-fact. "Yeah, it's bad. No, that doesn't change what we need to do."
ICE_COLD.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry used to feel more, used to let himself react. But he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ seen too many people lose control, seen how fast things spiral the moment someone lets fear in.\
  \ Now, he {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} it buried - because survival demands it. "You think staying calm is easy? No. But\

PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry will absolutely fight in whatever conditions he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} to,\

PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen people die because they settled for "good\

PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry has preferences for everything - how things are arranged,\

PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just complain - he fixes things. If something isn't\

  \ it right. Just let me handle it before I lose my mind."
PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry wasn't always this particular, but he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen what happens\

RECORD_KEEPER.label=Statistics Nerd
RECORD_KEEPER.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just react in combat - he {9, choice, 0#analyze|1#analyzes}. Every shot,\

RECORD_KEEPER.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry has a fact or figure for every situation, whether it's\

RECORD_KEEPER.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry has a number for everything. If something has happened\

RECORD_KEEPER.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry will correct you if you're exaggerating, estimating\

TRASH_TALKER.label=Relentless Trash Talker

BODY_DISCOMFORT.label=Uncomfortable in Their Own Body

  \ Instant tension. A brush against his arm? Barely-contained instinct to pull away. He {9, choice, 0#move|1#moves} like\
  \ someone who's always bracing for an impact that hasn't come yet. "Don't - just don't touch me\
  \ without warning."
TOUCH_SENSITIVE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry fights best when there's space between him and his\
  \ enemies. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} like being grabbed, held, or pressed into close-range combat - it makes his\
  \ skin crawl. "I don't do grappling. If they get that close, I make sure they don't stay there."
TOUCH_SENSITIVE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't flinch because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} nervous - he {9, choice, 0#flinch|1#flinches} because\
  \ too many times, a hand on his arm was followed by a knife, a grip on his shoulder by a strike.\
  \ He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} learned that even friendly touches can turn deadly in an instant. "Every time someone's\
  \ grabbed me without warning, something bad followed. You expect me to just forget that?"
TOUCH_SENSITIVE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry isn't obvious about it, but any time someone accidentally\
  \ brushes against him, claps him on the back, or leans in too close, his body reacts before he\
  \ does. "Nothing's wrong. Just - don't do that again."
TOUCH_SENSITIVE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry is constantly adjusting, subtly shifting away from people\
  \ without making a scene. It's not hostile - it's just instinct. He {9, choice, 0#move|1#moves} like someone who never\
  \ quite feels comfortable in physical space with others. "It's not you. I just... prefer some\
  \ space."
TOUCH_SENSITIVE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't hate touch - he just can't handle it. It makes\
  \ everything feel too real, too immediate, too much. The war, the weight of existence, the\
  \ feeling of being trapped in a body he never fully accepted. "Just - don't touch me. I don't need\
  \ a reason."

HOLOVID_FANATIC.label=Holovid Fanatic
HOLOVID_FANATIC.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry has a line from a holovid for every situation. Even in\
  \ the middle of combat, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} dropping one-liners, reenacting dramatic moments, and making sure\
  \ everyone knows exactly which classic scene they're living through. "You ever see Steel Storm\
  \ VI? Yeah? Then you know what happens next."
HOLOVID_FANATIC.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry fully believes in the coolest, most dramatic ways to\
  \ fight. If there's a stylish, over-the-top holovid maneuver that probably shouldn't work, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ trying it anyway. "Okay, hear me out - if I time this just right, it'll look incredible."
HOLOVID_FANATIC.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry knows real war isn't like the holovids, but if he lets\
  \ himself think about that too much, the weight of reality will crush him. So he {9, choice, 0#play|1#plays} the part,\
  \ delivers the lines, and pretends the good guys always win. "Tell me this isn't exactly like\
  \ that scene from Blood Horizon. Just let me have this."
HOLOVID_FANATIC.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just watch holovids - he {9, choice, 0#live|1#lives} and breathes them.\
  \ Every conversation is sprinkled with deep-cut references that absolutely no one understands.\
  \ "Oh, this is exactly like Nightfall Over Terra-7. Wait, you haven't seen it? What do you do\
  \ with your life?"
HOLOVID_FANATIC.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has a holovid moment for everything. If something happens,\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} already comparing it to a classic scene, no matter how ridiculous the connection is.\
  \ "This? This is straight out of The Curse of Atlas. Trust me, we're about to hit the third-act\
  \ twist."
HOLOVID_FANATIC.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry knows holovids are escapism, but he {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} care. They're\
  \ structured, predictable, full of meaning. Unlike the mess that is real life, where nothing\
  \ follows a script and everything falls apart for no reason. "Real life's got terrible pacing. At\
  \ least in holovids, things happen for a reason."

INVINCIBLE.label=Convinced They're Invincible
INVINCIBLE.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just take risks - he welcomes them. He'll charge\
  \ headfirst into fire, take the most dangerous route, and act like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} physically incapable of\
  \ dying. "Oh, relax. I've survived worse than this. Probably."
INVINCIBLE.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't see narrow escapes as luck - he {9, choice, 0#see|1#sees} them as\
  \ confirmation. Every bullet that whizzes past, every enemy that fails to land a hit just fuels\
  \ his belief that he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} untouchable. "You see that? Didn't even graze me. Like I said, they can't\
  \ hit me."
INVINCIBLE.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't let himself believe in his own mortality, because\
  \ if he {9, choice, 0#do|1#does}, the weight of everything he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} survived, everything he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} lost might crush him. It's\
  \ not arrogance - it's desperation. "I can't die. Not yet. Not like they did."
INVINCIBLE.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't hesitate before doing something reckless, whether\
  \ it's lifting something way too heavy, skipping proper procedures, or ignoring obvious hazards.\
  \ He {9, choice, 0#act|1#acts} like the rules don't apply to him. "Oh, come on. What's the worst that could happen?\
  \ Never happened to me before."
INVINCIBLE.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry has walked away from disasters unscathed so many times that\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} convinced it's not luck - it's just how things work for him. He {9, choice, 0#treat|1#treats} every near-miss as\
  \ proof of his invulnerability, yelling out "I am invincible" at the slightest provocation.
INVINCIBLE.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry isn't stupid. He {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} people die - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen it happen too\
  \ many times. But if he ever {9, choice, 0#let|1#lets} himself think it could happen to him, if he ever {9, choice, 0#let|1#lets} fear\
  \ creep in, he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} it'll slow him down, make him hesitate. And hesitation gets you killed.\
  \ "You think I'm reckless? No. I just refuse to believe I'm next."

STUTTERS.label=Stutters
STUTTERS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry's voice may stumble, but his hands never shake. He might\
  \ struggle to get the words out, but when the moment comes to act, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} quicker and sharper than\
  \ anyone else. "L-l-listen, I d-don't need to s-say it twice. Y-you better move n-now."
STUTTERS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry hides behind jokes, dry remarks, and an attitude, but\
  \ when the adrenaline spikes, the stutter follows. He {9, choice, 0#play|1#plays} it off, but everyone knows he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ trying to bury it under bravado. "Oh, y-you think you're g-g-good? G-give me a sec, lemme just\
  \ d-d-dodge that like it's n-n-nothing."
STUTTERS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry wasn't always like this. Maybe it was the stress, the\
  \ years of battle, the losses piling up. Whatever the cause, his mouth can't always keep up with\
  \ his brain anymore. "It's j-j-just a voice, r-right? As long as I c-can still f-f-fight, it\
  \ d-doesn't matter."
STUTTERS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's mind is fast, but sometimes his words aren't. He {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows}\
  \ the answer, knows what needs to be done, but getting it out in real time takes effort. "I-it's\
  \ n-not that c-c-complicated. J-just f-follow the d-d-damn instructions."
STUTTERS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't mind people noticing - he minds when they pretend not\
  \ to hear it. He waves it off, but every once in a while, you can see the frustration flicker\
  \ through. "Yeah, yeah, I g-g-get it, I t-trip over my words. B-but you know w-w-what? I still\
  \ get sh-sh-**** done."
STUTTERS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's body keeps going, but his mind is fractured in ways he'll\
  \ never fully fix. The stutter is just a symptom, a telltale sign that something in him is still\
  \ processing all the things he'll never talk about. "J-j-just let me w-w-work. D-d-doesn't matter\
  \ how I say it, as long as I g-g-get it d-d-done."

ACROPHOBIA.label=Afraid of Heights
ACROPHOBIA.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't hesitate in a fight, doesn't flinch at\
  \ explosions, doesn't fear charging into danger. But the second he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} too high off the ground,\
  \ that confidence vanishes. "No. I don't need a 'better vantage point.' I need to be on the\
  \ ground where I belong."
ACROPHOBIA.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry is known for being fearless - until a situation involves\
  \ height. He {9, choice, 0#avoid|1#avoids} cliffs, refuses to stand near edges, and takes every alternate route\
  \ possible. "Yeah, yeah, I know it's the 'quickest way.' It's also a death sentence. Find another\
  \ path."
ACROPHOBIA.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has watched people go over the edge. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen what's\
  \ left when they hit the ground. He {9, choice, 0#remember|1#remembers} the silence right before impact. His fear isn't\
  \ irrational - it's experience. "You ever hear the sound someone makes when they realize there's no\
  \ way back? I have. That's why I'm staying right here."
ACROPHOBIA.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry will find another way, no matter how impractical. Ladders,\
  \ scaffolding, high walkways - he'll go twice the distance if it means staying close to the ground.\
  \ "Nah, not my problem. Someone else can deal with it. Preferably someone who doesn't value their\
  \ life."
ACROPHOBIA.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry plays it cool, but if you watch closely, he never gets too\
  \ close to anything with a sheer drop. He {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} his distance, avoids looking down, and never\
  \ volunteers for anything involving heights. "Nope. Not happening. You want me to do what? Yeah,\
  \ I don't think so."
ACROPHOBIA.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just fear falling - he {9, choice, 0#fear|1#fears} what happens after. The\
  \ helplessness, the seconds of knowing there's nothing you can do, the certainty that the ground\
  \ is waiting for you. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen it too many times to ever risk it himself. "People think fear of\
  \ heights is about the fall. It's not. It's about the moment before - the one where you know\
  \ there's nothing left to save you."

CLAUSTROPHOBIA.label=Fear of Enclosed Spaces
CLAUSTROPHOBIA.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry thrives in open terrain, where he can move, reposition,\
  \ and breathe. But when he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} forced into tight corridors, narrow tunnels, or cramped interiors,\
  \ his nerves start to fray. "I don't care if it's 'good cover' - it's a deathtrap. I need space to\
  \ move."
CLAUSTROPHOBIA.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry will take the long way if it means avoiding enclosed\
  \ areas. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} do tunnels, small vehicles (not anymore), or tight formations. If there's\
  \ only one exit, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} already looking for another option. "One way in, one way out? Yeah, not\
  \ happening. That's how people die."
CLAUSTROPHOBIA.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has been stuck, buried, locked in, and he swore he'd\
  \ never let it happen again. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen what happens when people can't get out, heard the last\
  \ panicked breaths of those who never made it. "You don't understand. It's not the space. It's\
  \ the feeling of knowing there's no way out."
CLAUSTROPHOBIA.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry never outright says he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} a problem, but he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} always\
  \ positioning himself near exits, keeping space between himself and others, and avoiding rooms\
  \ that feel too small. "I'll stand. Don't need to sit. Yeah, the corner's fine. More space."
CLAUSTROPHOBIA.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't panic, but his discomfort is obvious if you know\
  \ what to look for. His breathing changes, his posture stiffens, and his eyes keep darting to the\
  \ door. "I'm fine. Just - this place is way too small. Not a fan."
CLAUSTROPHOBIA.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry knows what it's like to be helpless in a confined space,\
  \ unable to move, waiting for something to end him. He can still hear the echoes of those who\
  \ didn't make it out. "I don't do tight spaces. Ever. Because I know exactly how it ends."

AGORAPHOBIA.label=Fear of Open Spaces
AGORAPHOBIA.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry hates wide-open battlefields. He feels exposed,\
  \ vulnerable, and too easy to target. If there's no cover, if there's too much empty space around\
  \ him, his instincts start screaming. "You want me to stand out in the open? What, you trying to\
  \ get me killed?"
AGORAPHOBIA.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry isn't afraid to fight, but he feels better when there's a\
  \ ceiling over his head, solid walls around him, and nowhere for enemies to flank him. Wide, open\
  \ battlefields? He'll take his chances elsewhere. "I don't trust empty space. Too many angles,\
  \ too many places to get hit from."
AGORAPHOBIA.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen what happens when people stand out in the open.\
  \ He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} watched them get picked off from unseen angles, witnessed how quickly an exposed position\
  \ turns into a death sentence. Now? He {9, choice, 0#stay|1#stays} where he can control his surroundings. "Out there,\
  \ you're nothing but a target. Here? Here, at least you have a chance."
AGORAPHOBIA.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry is always near a wall, close to an exit, never lingering in\
  \ open spaces for too long. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} like crowds, doesn't like too much space between him and\
  \ the nearest solid structure. "I'll stand over here. Feels better this way."
AGORAPHOBIA.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't panic, but he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} noticeably uneasy in large, open\
  \ spaces. He {9, choice, 0#stick|1#sticks} to shadows, corners, anywhere that makes the world feel smaller. "I'd rather\
  \ not stand in the middle of this room. You never know who's watching."
AGORAPHOBIA.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry hates open spaces because he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} exactly how fast things\
  \ can go wrong when there's no cover, no safety, nowhere to hide. He {9, choice, 0#avoid|1#avoids} crowds because\
  \ they're unpredictable, uncontrollable, and just as dangerous in their own way. "Too many eyes,\
  \ too many exits, too many places to die without seeing it coming."

NYCTOPHOBIA.label=Fear of the Dark
NYCTOPHOBIA.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry fights without hesitation, moves without fear, but in\
  \ total darkness, his hands tighten, his breathing changes. He won't admit it outright, but the\
  \ blackness unnerves him. "I don't need night vision - I need a damn light."
NYCTOPHOBIA.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't freeze in the dark - he {9, choice, 0#move|1#moves}, acts, does anything\
  \ but stand there and let the blackness settle around him. The quiet, the emptiness, the feeling\
  \ of not knowing what's lurking? Unacceptable. "I'll take an open skirmish over this any day. At\
  \ least bullets don't sneak up on you from nowhere."
NYCTOPHOBIA.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry knows better than most that bad things happen in the\
  \ dark. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} heard the screams of people who wandered too far into it, seen the bodies of those\
  \ who didn't make it out. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} fear the dark itself - he {9, choice, 0#fear|1#fears} what always waits inside it.\
  \ "The dark doesn't kill you. It just hides the thing that will."
NYCTOPHOBIA.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't trust dimly lit rooms. If a bulb flickers, he\
  \ notices immediately. If he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} in a dark space for too long, he {9, choice, 0#start|1#starts} looking for any excuse to\
  \ bring in more light. "No, I don't think it's 'cozy' - I think it's a goddamn liability."
NYCTOPHOBIA.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry isn't dramatic about it, but he won't walk into a\
  \ pitch-black space. If someone turns off the lights too soon, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} already reaching for a\
  \ flashlight. "I don't do pitch black. Shadows? Fine. But I want to see what's around me."
NYCTOPHOBIA.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry has heard too many stories, seen too many things disappear\
  \ into the black and never return. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} fear the dark because it's empty - he {9, choice, 0#fear|1#fears} it\
  \ because he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} it never really is. "You don't hear them scream. One second they're there.\
  \ Then... nothing. That's why I don't go in blind."

MONOPHOBIA.label=Fear of Being Alone
MONOPHOBIA.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry can handle gunfire, explosions, and chaos, but the second\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} alone, the tension starts building. He {9, choice, 0#check|1#checks} his comms too often, moves faster than\
  \ necessary, like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} trying to escape the silence itself. "You still there? Just - check in every\
  \ few minutes, alright?"
MONOPHOBIA.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't do silent battlefields, abandoned locations, or\
  \ lone assignments. If he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} the only one left in an area, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} on edge, restless, moving just to\
  \ break the quiet. "I don't like this. Too quiet. Way too quiet."
MONOPHOBIA.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen teammates disappear, heard allies fall silent,\
  \ felt the weight of being the last one alive. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} fear isolation itself - he {9, choice, 0#fear|1#fears} what it\
  \ means. "The second you're alone? That's when you know it's over."
MONOPHOBIA.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't announce his discomfort, but he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} always where\
  \ people are. He lingers just a little longer in group settings, always finds a reason to stay\
  \ around someone. "Nah, I'm not leaving yet. Just... finishing something up."
MONOPHOBIA.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't handle silence well. He {9, choice, 0#fill|1#fills} it with casual\
  \ conversation, jokes, even pointless observations - anything to keep the emptiness from creeping\
  \ in. "Yeah, I know I talk a lot. You'd rather sit in silence?"
MONOPHOBIA.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry isn't afraid of solitude. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} afraid of what happens to him\
  \ in solitude. The thoughts that come back, the ghosts that settle in, the weight of everything\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} lost pressing down on him all at once. "You think being alone just means no one's\
  \ around? No. It means there's no one left."

HEMOPHOBIA.label=Fear of Blood
HEMOPHOBIA.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry fights without hesitation, pushes through gunfire and\
  \ explosions, but the moment he {9, choice, 0#see|1#sees} blood - his or anyone else's - his focus fractures. His\
  \ breathing changes, his grip tightens, and he forces himself to look anywhere else. "I'm fine. I\
  \ just - don't ask me to look at it."
HEMOPHOBIA.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't acknowledge injuries. If someone's hit, if\
  \ something's bleeding, he {9, choice, 0#focus|1#focuses} on everything else - the fight, the strategy, anything but the\
  \ mess pooling beneath them. "We'll deal with it after. Just - just don't describe it to me."
HEMOPHOBIA.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has seen blood spill in ways no one should, has watched it\
  \ drain from bodies, watched people cough it up, watched it soak into the ground like a stain\
  \ that never washes away. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} lost too many people, and now the sight of it makes his stomach\
  \ twist. "It's not fear. It's knowing exactly what happens next."
HEMOPHOBIA.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry winces when someone gets a paper cut, turns away if there's\
  \ even a hint of red. He {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to handle anything that involves blood and will find any excuse\
  \ to leave the room. "Nope. Not doing that. Someone else handle it."
HEMOPHOBIA.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry pretends he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} fine, but the moment someone starts bleeding,\
  \ even slightly, his reaction is immediate. His expression tightens, his hands clench, and he\
  \ very quickly finds an excuse to be somewhere else. "Yeah, I'm good. Just - uh, I'll be back in a\
  \ minute."
HEMOPHOBIA.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just fear blood - he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} what it means. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen\
  \ people lose too much, watched them weaken, slow down, go pale. Blood isn't just a mess - it's a\

ZERO_G_PARALYSIS.label=Fear of Zero-G
ZERO_G_PARALYSIS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry thrives in any environment where he can feel the\
  \ weight of his own body. But the second he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} in zero gravity, he freezes. His instincts fail\
  \ him, his movements feel wrong, and the lack of control sets his nerves on fire. "This - this\
  \ isn't right. I can't - I need something solid beneath me."
ZERO_G_PARALYSIS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry hates floating. It's not natural, not right, and\
  \ every attempt to move feels like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} fighting against something invisible. He won't admit it,\
  \ but the moment he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} in zero-G, he becomes a liability instead of a fighter. "I'm not scared. I\
  \ just - don't ask me to do anything useful up here."
ZERO_G_PARALYSIS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has been in zero-G before, and he hated every second\
  \ of it. No control, no weight, no sense of where danger could come from. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen people drift\
  \ away, unable to stop themselves, watched them disappear into the black, helpless. "You lose\
  \ control up here? You don't get it back. You just keep floating until something kills you or you\
  \ run out of air."
ZERO_G_PARALYSIS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry actively avoids any situation that might require zero\
  \ gravity. If there's a job that needs to be done weightless, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} already volunteering someone\

ZERO_G_PARALYSIS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry tries to act normal, but in zero-G, he can't hide his\

ZERO_G_PARALYSIS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just dislike zero gravity - he {9, choice, 0#fear|1#fears} it because\

HEDONIST.label=Hedonist
HEDONIST.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't fight for honor, duty, or ideology - he {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} because\
  \ it makes him feel alive. Every battle is a rush, a sensation, a fleeting moment of pure\

  \ I intend to enjoy every second of it."
HEDONIST.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry never lets a win pass without making the most of it. He\

  \ "We survived today? Then we drink, we feast, and we take what we can. Because tomorrow?\
  \ Tomorrow is a gamble."
HEDONIST.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has stopped believing in long-term plans, in saving up, in\

  \ always playing something, whether it's dramatic orchestral scores, pounding war drums, or\
  \ completely inappropriate upbeat tunes. "If we're going into hell, we might as well have a\
  \ killer playlist."
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry keeps his lance energized and his enemies confused\
  \ by ensuring every engagement comes with a backing track. One moment it's hard-hitting metal,\
  \ the next it's a slow, eerie hum that unsettles everyone. "Oh, you don't like my music? Guess\
  \ you better finish the fight fast then."
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry keeps the music going because without it, all that's\
  \ left is the sound of gunfire, screams, and things he'd rather not remember. He drowns it all\
  \ out before it can creep in. "You want me to turn it off? No. I don't do silence."
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry's workspace is never quiet. Whether it's a steady\
  \ beat, a slow melody, or something completely chaotic, there's always some kind of sound filling\
  \ the air. "I work better with music. And you? You'll get used to it."
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't ask permission - he just starts playing whatever\
  \ music he {9, choice, 0#want|1#wants}, expecting everyone else to deal with it. If someone complains? He {9, choice, 0#turn|1#turns} it up\
  \ just a little louder. "You'd rather sit in silence? That's the real crime here."
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry knows that if he ever {9, choice, 0#let|1#lets} things go silent, the\
  \ memories will start creeping back in. The people who aren't here anymore, the things he should\
  \ have done differently. So the music stays on - always. "The second the music stops, that's when\
  \ it gets bad. And I don't plan on letting it stop."

NEMESIS.label=Has a Nemesis
NEMESIS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight - he {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} with purpose. There's always one\
  \ name, one face, one opponent that he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} constantly measuring himself against. Every battle is\
  \ just another step toward proving, once and for all, who's better. "Tell me they're here. Tell\
  \ me they showed up. I want this fight to matter."
NEMESIS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry has an personal enemy and he {9, choice, 0#remember|1#remembers} every fight, every\
  \ close call, every trick his nemesis has ever pulled. He replays past encounters in his head,\
  \ looking for patterns, weaknesses, an edge. "Last time, they hesitated when pressured. This\
  \ time? I won't give them the chance."
NEMESIS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry knows that most fights don't matter, that most enemies are\
  \ just faceless obstacles. But there's one. One that is different. One that is personal. This\
  \ rivalry is the only thing left that still feels like it has meaning. "They'll either kill me,\
  \ or I'll kill them. And that's the only thing I know for sure anymore."
NEMESIS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry has one person who, for whatever reason, has become his eternal\
  \ competition. It might be serious, ridiculous, or entirely one-sided, but he {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to back\
  \ down. "Oh, they did it first? Great. Now I have to do it better."
NEMESIS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry turns everything into a direct challenge between himself and\
  \ his nemesis. It could be work efficiency, problem-solving, or even something as simple as\
  \ making coffee - he must come out on top. "If they did it in five minutes, I'll do it in four.\
  \ Watch me."
NEMESIS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just have a rival - he {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} a fixation. A constant\
  \ presence in his life that keeps him pushing forward, staying sharp, refusing to slip into\
  \ complacency. Without that challenge, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} not sure he'd know what to do with himself anymore.\
  \ "Without them, I don't know who I'd be. And that scares me more than losing."

FEAR_MEKS.label=Fear of Mek
FEAR_MEKS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry hates being near Mek, not because they're ineffective,\
  \ but because they're too effective. Every time he {9, choice, 0#see|1#sees} one move, he {9, choice, 0#remember|1#remembers} what they leave\
  \ behind - crushed buildings, burning wreckage, bodies no one ever digs out. "You don't pilot a\
  \ 'Mek. You unleash one. And when it moves, something always gets left in ruins."
FEAR_MEKS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry won't touch a 'Mek unless there's no other choice. He'd\
  \ rather fight on foot, in vehicles, anywhere that doesn't feel like piloting a walking war\
  \ crime. "You ever seen a 'Mek step on a person? No? Then you don't understand why I don't trust\
  \ those things."
FEAR_MEKS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry has watched entire towns vanish under 'Mek fire. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen\
  \ warriors pulped by autocannons meant for armored targets. And the worst part? Most pilots don't\
  \ seem to care, they just continue walking forward like nothing happened."
FEAR_MEKS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry never stands too close to a 'Mek, never trusts that they're\
  \ fully powered down, never walks beneath one without his pulse spiking. They're too big, too\
  \ unnatural, too much like monsters pretending to be machines. "I don't care if it's offline.\
  \ That thing's one bad signal away from flattening this entire place."
FEAR_MEKS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't see engineering marvels, doesn't admire firepower or\
  \ armor plating. When he {9, choice, 0#look|1#looks} at a 'Mek, all he {9, choice, 0#see|1#sees} are crushed buildings, burning streets,\
  \ people who never had a chance to run. "You ever watch a 'Mek walk through a city? The pilot\
  \ thinks it's just debris. I've seen the bodies they pull out after."
FEAR_MEKS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just dislike Mek - he {9, choice, 0#fear|1#fears} them, because he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} been\
  \ there when they've turned entire streets into craters, reduced people to nothing but a red\
  \ mist. And he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} they're not done yet. "Mek don't fight. They erase. And once they've\
  \ started, they don't stop until nothing's left."

LOCAL_CONNECTOR.label=Local Connector
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just see territory - he {9, choice, 0#see|1#sees} people. Whenever\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} deployed, he learns the culture, the customs, the stories of those who live there. He\
  \ doesn't believe in fighting blindly. "You want to survive out here? Then talk to the ones who\
  \ actually live here - they've been surviving longer than we have."
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry isn't just here to fight - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} here to understand. He\
  \ talks to locals, listens to their concerns, finds ways to work with them instead of trampling\
  \ over them. He {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} that alliances built through respect last longer than those built through\
  \ fear. "You think we can just roll in, do our job, and leave? That's why so many before us failed."
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't trust command, strategy reports, or maps\
  \ drawn by people who have never stepped foot here. He {9, choice, 0#trust|1#trusts} locals. He {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} that understanding\
  \ them is the difference between life and death. "You ignore them, you die. It's that simple. And\
  \ when you do, they won't mourn you. They'll say you deserved it."
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't treat new places like temporary stops. He\
  \ learns the culture, the etiquette, the things outsiders usually ignore. If he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} going to be\
  \ somewhere new, he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} going to do it right. "If you don't bother to learn how people live, don't\
  \ be surprised when they don't want you here."
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry never stays just with his unit - he integrates into local\
  \ life. He'll be found talking with vendors, learning regional slang, and making himself at home.\
  \ "You want to know what's really going on? Talk to the people who actually live here. Not the\
  \ ones just passing through."
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry isn't just curious - he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} calculating. He {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} that when\
  \ things go south, it won't be his team, his leadership, or his training that saves him. It'll\
  \ be whether or not the locals think he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} worth saving. "One day, you're going to need a favor.\
  \ And if you didn't bother to earn their trust first, you're not getting one."

HATRED.label=Hates the Enemy
HATRED.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't just fight against the enemy - he {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} because of\
  \ them. Every engagement is personal, every battle another chance to wipe them from existence.\
  \ "No mercy. No second chances. If they're standing, they're still a threat."
HATRED.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't see gray areas or moral debates. He {9, choice, 0#see|1#sees} right and\
  \ wrong, us and them. The enemy isn't just someone on the other side - they're a stain that needs\
  \ to be wiped out. "I don't want to hear about 'understanding them.' I want to hear that they're\
  \ dead."
HATRED.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't hate without reason. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} seen the ruins, the bodies,\
  \ the aftermath of what the enemy has done. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} fight for glory - he {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} for revenge.\
  \ "You don't 'negotiate' with butchers. You make sure they never get the chance to do it again."
HATRED.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry won't entertain conversations about why the enemy does what they\
  \ do. He won't listen to sympathy, won't engage with debate. To him, the only good conversation\
  \ about the enemy is one that ends with their destruction. "I don't care about their motives. I\
  \ care about making sure they don't walk away from this war."
HATRED.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just oppose the enemy - he despises them. Any attempt at\
  \ rationalizing, debating, or finding common ground sets him on edge. "You think they'd show you\
  \ the same sympathy? They wouldn't. So stop wasting your breath."
HATRED.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry carries the scars of what the enemy has done. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} lost too\
  \ much, seen too much, felt too much pain to ever let it go. His hate isn't blind - it's earned.\
  \ "If you knew what I knew, if you'd seen what I've seen, you'd hate them too. And you wouldn't\
  \ stop until they were gone."

PANTSLESS.label=Refuses to Wear Pants
PANTSLESS.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry storms into battle bare-legged and completely unbothered,\
  \ treating the absence of pants like it's a tactical decision. If anyone asks, he'll claim it's\
  \ for better mobility - but really, he just {9, choice, 0#hate|1#hates} the feel of fabric on his\
  \ legs. "Look, pants slow me down. You want me fast, or you want me fashionable?"
PANTSLESS.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's refusal to wear pants isn't a statement - it's just how he\
  \ {9, choice, 0#live|1#lives}. Cold weather, hot weather, formal gatherings - it doesn't matter. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#stand|1#stands} there in nothing at all, arms crossed, completely unapologetic.\
  \ "You think a pair of pants is going to make me a better fighter? Didn't think so."
PANTSLESS.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's resistance to pants isn't a joke - it's a refusal to be\
  \ restricted by anything, even clothing. He'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} spent too long being told where\
  \ to go, what to do, how to live. No one's going to strap him into uniform now. "I've lost too much\
  \ to let someone tell me what to wear. If they don't like it, they can try and stop me."
PANTSLESS.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry shows up to meetings pants-free with the confidence of someone\
  \ who genuinely believes this is everyone else's problem, not his. He'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ completely immune to side-eyes, awkward stares, and HR complaints. "It's not a violation of the\
  \ dress code if they never specified pants."
PANTSLESS.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's hatred of pants is a non-negotiable part of his identity. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#work|1#works} perfectly well without them, so why bother changing now? If anyone\
  \ mentions it, he just {9, choice, 0#shrug|1#shrugs}. "I'm getting the job done. What else matters?"
PANTSLESS.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's refusal to wear pants is less about comfort and more about\
  \ control. After years of living under rules and orders, ditching pants is his way of reclaiming\
  \ some small measure of autonomy. "They took a lot from me over the years. They're not taking my\
  \ freedom to breathe."

MAKES_CLOTHES.label=Makes Clothes for Others
MAKES_CLOTHES.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry might be a walking weapon on the battlefield, but off it,\
  \ he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got a steady hand and a knack for stitching. His lance has learned that\
  \ if their gear rips, Barry will have it patched up - and probably improved - within a day. "Sure,\
  \ I could let supply handle it. Or I could fix it right and not have it fall apart in the middle\
  \ of a skirmish."
MAKES_CLOTHES.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't make a big deal about it, but half the squad is\
  \ wearing something he'{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} made. He'll hand you a scarf or a jacket with zero\
  \ fanfare, like he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} handing over ammo. "Just take it. You'll freeze otherwise.\
  \ Don't make it weird."
MAKES_CLOTHES.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry's habit of making clothes started after too many cold\
  \ nights, too many friends without enough gear. If he can't keep them alive in a fight, the least\
  \ he can do is keep them warm after. "You wear it, you remember why you survived. And you don't\
  \ waste it."
MAKES_CLOTHES.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't just make clothes - he customizes them. Half the\
  \ crew is walking around in sweaters with inside jokes or poorly hidden insults stitched into the\
  \ hems. "Yeah, the stitching says 'hero.' Didn't say which kind of hero, though."
MAKES_CLOTHES.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry doesn't ask for thanks - he just {9, choice, 0#hand|1#hands}\
  \ over a jacket or a pair of gloves and moves on. He {9, choice, 0#treat|1#treats} it like it's\
  \ basic maintenance, not a personal favor. "It's cold. You didn't have gloves. Problem solved."
MAKES_CLOTHES.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry makes clothes because it's something tangible, something\
  \ he can control when everything else feels like it's spiraling. The fact that people wear his work\
  \ means a part of him is protecting them, even when he'{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} not there. "If you're\
  \ going to bleed, you might as well bleed in something that fits."

ACTS_SUSPICIOUSLY.label=Acts Suspiciously
ACTS_SUSPICIOUSLY.description.0.COMBATANT=Barry always seems to be up to something. He\
  \ {9, choice, 0#disappear|1#disappears} without explanation, {9, choice, 0#answer|1#answers} questions\
  \ with vague half-smiles, and always {9, choice, 0#seem|1#seems} to know more than he should. "Relax.\
  \ If I were planning something shady, you wouldn't know until it was too late."
ACTS_SUSPICIOUSLY.description.1.COMBATANT=Barry's habit of avoiding direct answers and disappearing\
  \ at odd hours has raised more than a few eyebrows. He {9, choice, 0#don't|1#doesn't} bother denying\
  \ it - he just he {9, choice, 0#meet|1#meets} suspicion with a deadpan expression and a shrug. "If\
  \ you have to ask what I'm doing, you already know I'm not gonna tell you."
ACTS_SUSPICIOUSLY.description.2.COMBATANT=Barry doesn't explain himself because he {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows}\
  \ that if people knew the truth, they'd never trust him again. His motives are buried under layers\
  \ of necessity and survival. "You don't need to know why I'm doing this. You just need to decide if\
  \ you're coming with me or not."
ACTS_SUSPICIOUSLY.description.0.SUPPORT=Barry has a habit of showing up where he's not supposed to be\
  \ and knowing things he shouldn't know. If you ask him how, he just {9, choice, 0#smirk|1#smirks}\
  \ and changes the subject. "Oh, that? Let's just say I have sources."
ACTS_SUSPICIOUSLY.description.1.SUPPORT=Barry's tendency to keep secrets and dodge questions makes\
  \ him a walking mystery. He's not lying - but he's definitely not telling the whole truth either.\
  \ "Do you really wanna know, or are you just being polite?"
ACTS_SUSPICIOUSLY.description.2.SUPPORT=Barry's secrecy isn't about deception - it's about protection.\
  \ If people knew what he knew, they'd sleep a lot less soundly at night. "It's not that I don't\
  \ trust you. It's that you don't want to know what I'm keeping from you."
