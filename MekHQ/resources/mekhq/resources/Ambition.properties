CALCULATING.ronin=I''ve been watching how you operate - and I like what I see. That''s why I''m\

CONNIVING.ronin=You have a problem - you just might not know it yet. That''s why I''m here.\
  <p>The battlefield isn''t just about firepower; it''s about control. Anyone can pull a trigger - the\

  \ question when it matters most. That''s where I excel.</p>\
  <p>I don''t fight fair - I fight to win. Subtlety, misdirection, alliances - all weapons in the\

  \ your enemies tear themselves apart before you even show up. And if that means bending a few\
  \ truths or breaking a few promises along the way... well, that''s how wars are won.</p>\
  <p>I''m not asking for trust. I wouldn''t give it to me either. But if you''re smart - and I think\

  <p>I''ve seen what happens when command falls apart. Too many voices, too many opinions, and\

ENERGETIC.ronin=I hear you''re looking for someone who can keep up. Well, good news - I don''t slow\

  <p>But it''s not just about stamina - it''s about momentum. You don''t win battles by waiting - you\

  <p>I''ve had a few offers - most from outfits that don''t understand how to keep up. You? I think\

EXCESSIVE.description.3={0} doesn''t believe in limits. Whether it''s effort, firepower, or sheer\

EXCESSIVE.ronin=If you''re looking for subtlety, you''ve got the wrong person. But if you want results?\
  \ You just found the right one.\
  <p>I don''t do half-measures. If the mission calls for a show of force, I''ll make sure they see the\
  \ mushroom cloud from orbit. If a problem needs solving, I''m not bringing a knife - I''m bringing\

  \ Overrated. Overwhelming force wins battles - always has, always will.</p>\
  <p>And it''s not just about firepower - it''s about commitment. You give me a job, I''ll throw\
  \ everything I''ve got at it. I don''t hold back, I don''t slow down, and I don''t stop until we win.\
  \ Even if it means going through every last round of ammo and leaving nothing but wreckage in our\

  <p>You''ve probably worked with pilots who get rattled under pressure - the ones who hesitate when\

  <p>I''ve seen too many people crumble because they lost momentum, waiting for someone else to figure\
  \ things out. That''s not me. When things get tough, I dig deeper. When others hesitate, I push\
  \ harder. And when the mission looks impossible, I don''t stop until it''s done.</p>\
  <p>Why your unit? Because you''ve got something real here - a team that''s close to being great. You\
  \ just need someone to keep the fire burning when the odds start stacking up. Someone who knows\
  \ how to drive people harder, push them further - and lead from the front while doing it.</p>\
  <p>Let me in, and you won''t have to wonder if the job will get done. It will - because I''ll make\
  \ sure of it.</p>

  <p>I''m not here to play fair or follow someone else''s rules. If a weakness presents itself, I''m\

  <p>Why your unit? Simple. You''ve got the potential to go far, but you need someone who knows how\

TYRANNICAL.description.1={0} doesn''t lead - {2} rules. Fear and obedience are {6} weapons, and {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#have|1#has} no patience for weakness. Those who resist {4} are crushed, those who\
  \ fail {4} are discarded, and those who follow {4} do so because they fear the alternative.
TYRANNICAL.description.2={0} believes no one else can be trusted to do things right, so {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#take|1#takes} control of everything. Every decision, every resource, every move\
  \ must go through {4}. If {6} subordinates don''t like it, they can be replaced.
TYRANNICAL.description.3={0} doesn''t believe in compromise - {6} word is law. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#dictate|1#dictates} every action with absolute authority, ensuring that those under\

TYRANNICAL.description.4=Power isn''t just something {0} holds - it''s something {2}\

TYRANNICAL.description.5={0} doesn''t delegate, doesn''t share control, and doesn''t tolerate\

  \ be corrected.
TYRANNICAL.ronin=Let''s get one thing straight - I''m not asking to join your unit. I''m offering you\
  \ the opportunity to benefit from someone who knows how to command. There''s a difference. I''ve\
  \ seen what happens when leadership gets soft - hesitation, compromise, and eventually collapse.\
  \ I don''t let that happen. I take control. I keep order. And I make sure things get done my way -\
  \ because my way works.\
  <p>I don''t tolerate insubordination. When I give an order, it gets followed - no questions, no\
  \ hesitation. Loyalty isn''t something I expect - it''s something I demand. Those who can''t handle\
  \ that? They don''t last long. If you want someone to hold hands and sing songs about unity, look\
  \ somewhere else. If you want someone who will bring your unit in line, keep them sharp, and ensure\
  \ every mission ends with our victory - you know where to find me.</p>\
  <p>You''ll benefit from my experience and control. In exchange, I expect authority - real authority.\
  \ No second-guessing. No hand-wringing. You put me in charge, and I''ll make sure your unit doesn''t\
  \ just survive - it dominates.</p>\
  <p>If you''re ready to stop playing games and start winning, I''m ready to lead. If not... don''t waste\
  \ my time.</p>

UNAMBITIOUS.label=Unambitious

UNAMBITIOUS.description.2={0} doesn''t see the point in fighting for a bigger slice of the pie\

UNAMBITIOUS.ronin=I''m not here to impress anyone - let''s get that straight. I know how this works.\
  \ Some people are in this game to climb the ladder, chase glory, and collect medals. Me? I''m not\
  \ one of them. I''m here to do a job, get paid, and not die in the process. That''s enough for me.\
  <p>So why join your unit? Because you don''t seem like the type to care about status games either.\
  \ You want people who''ll show up, put in the work, and not get caught up in the politics. That''s\
  \ me. I''ll pull my weight, follow orders, and keep things running smoothly - but don''t expect me\
  \ to be out there trying to make a name for myself.</p>\
  <p>I''m not lazy - I''m realistic. I''ve seen too many ambitious types burn out or get themselves\
  \ killed trying to be heroes. I''m not interested in that kind of ending. Keep me on the roster,\

  <p>If that works for you, let me know. If not? No hard feelings.</p>

  <p>That''s why you need me. You''ve got a unit full of warriors trying to fight clean while the\

  \ that survival and victory don''t come from playing fair.</p>\
  <p>Why your unit? Because you''re smart enough to know that clean hands don''t win wars. You need\

  <p>This isn''t about ego - it''s about vision. I know what''s coming, and I know how to prepare for\
