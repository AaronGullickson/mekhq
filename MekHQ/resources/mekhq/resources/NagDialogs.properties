# Admin Strain
AdminStrainNagDialog.ic={0}, my team is buckling under the strain. Memos are going unanswered. We''ve got people queuing\
  \ up outside with complaints. We''ve even got reports of unpaid salaries. People are getting angry, and if we don''t\
  \ solve the problem soon, they''re liable to quit.
AdminStrainNagDialog.ooc=Excess <a href=''GLOSSARY:ADMIN_STRAIN''>Administrative Strain</a> is addressed by hiring more\
  \ Admin/HR personnel. If that isn''t viable, consider assigning your current Admin personnel to multiple roles.</p>\
  <p>For more information, please see <i>MekHQ/docs/Personnel Modules/Turnover & Retention Module (feat. Fatigue).pdf</i></p>\
  <p>If you accidentally suppress this warning, you can re-enable it in MekHQ Options.</p>
# Deployment Shortfall
DeploymentShortfallNagDialog.ic={0}, deployment levels fall below contractual requirements for one\
  \ or more contracts. While advancing the day is an option, it may strain relations with our\
  \ employer. Do you wish to continue without addressing this?
DeploymentShortfallNagDialog.ooc=You should head to the Briefing Room and address this shortfall.\
  \ Remember, <a href=''GLOSSARY:COMBAT_TEAMS''>Combat Teams</a> assigned to the Auxiliary or\
  \ Reserve roles do not count towards deployment levels. Nor do Combat Teams assigned to the\
  \ Training role, unless the contract is Cadre Duty.\
